   <title>
    <p>Chapter One</p>
   </title>
   <p>The house that stood on the edge of the moorland had a look of total remoteness, as if all within were quiet and ever would be so. White palings, newly-painted, surrounded the frontage and-reaching halfway around the back of the stone-built residence-gave way on either side to a barred gate which led into a paddock where a horse was grazing.</p>
   <p>Reining in his own quiet nag, the Reverend Percival Jubstone wondered which of the two new inhabitants of <emphasis>Edgemoore, </emphasis>as it was aptly called, were at home. It would almost surely be Miss Vanessa Markham, he told himself, since her brother would be at his teaching post at this hour. Village gossip, which so often reached his ears via his housekeeper, told him that she was an attractive woman. He hoped it would be so and, having tethered his horse, took the path to the front door and drew upon the bell, hearing it jangle within.</p>
   <p>Scarcely a moment passed before the door was opened by a young maid, cap askew and with a cloth in her hand.</p>
   <p>'Your Mistress is in?' enquired Percival politely, taking note all at one and the same time of the girl's age, which he judged to be about seventeen, the slimness of her figure and the promising gourds which her black dress revealed.</p>
   <p>'Oh, sir, your Reverendship!' Mary uttered, quite taken aback by the appearance of one who seemed to her such a lordly person.</p>
   <p>'It is all right, Mary', came a voice from an adjoining room, and therewith appeared Vanessa herself-a comely young woman indeed of perhaps twenty-eight or so, as the Vicar immediately perceived.</p>
   <p>'Yes, ma'am', Mary said almost thankfully, for it was her first day at the house and no one had told her how to receive visitors, this in great part being because Miss Markham had expected none as yet. Edging away while trying to give all appearance of not really doing so, Mary succeeded in giving way to both and scuttled thankfully back into the kitchen.</p>
   <p>'I thought to call-to make myself known. Forgive me if I have arrived at an inopportune moment', boomed the reverend gentleman.</p>
   <p>'Not at all, not at all-pray come in. I am sorry about Mary's ineptitude. She is young and…"</p>
   <p>'Untrained?' he interrupted her as they entered the small drawing room that was pleasingly uncluttered. 'Forgive me for having broken across what you may have been about to say, Miss Markham. It is a matter to which I have given much thought, however'.</p>
   <p>'Yes?' asked Vanessa in a tone of voice that to some more sensitive souls would have appeared strained. Indicating a comfortable armchair for her visitor, she took up her seat on an equally-well-padded sofa which the Vicar regarded with a professional eye-professional, that is to say, in relation to his private interests, for the arms of the piece of furniture were nobly curved and were winged outwards at an angle which was immediately cogent to his thoughts of how one such as Mary could be put over one of the arms with her bottom well up.</p>
   <p>'The-er-yes, the training of young girls. I was about to say, with your permission, that it is most desirable, do you not think?'</p>
   <p>'I have not given much thought to the matter, Vicar', responded Vanessa, whose cheeks flushed slightly while- as though to distract herself-she summoned Mary by means of a small silver handbell and ordered tea.</p>
   <p>'I have made it already, ma'am, and you wish', said the girl, showing much pride at having anticipated the request.</p>
   <p>'You see', declared Vanessa when after but a few moments they were served, 'she is a good girl'.</p>
   <p>'In all respects?' asked the cleric with something of a twinkle in his eye, for the more he looked upon his hostess the more he liked. Vanessa might have been described by some as a strapping girl (no pun thereby being intended),</p>
   <p>for she was but an inch or so shorter than the Vicar. Unclothed, however, her full beauty was revealed: two noble breasts as white as mounds of snow, a subtly-curved belly beneath which a thick triangular thatch gathered around her slit, thighs of columnar splendour, vaselike hips, and a bottom that would have stirred the penis of a statue.</p>
   <p>'You touch upon her modesty, I believe-or mine', she murmured, casting her eyes down to the thin bone china of her cup.</p>
   <p>'Modesty may be used as a cloak for devilment-I have often known it so-and vice versa'.</p>
   <p>'Would you then constantly upbraid one such as Mary?' Vanessa asked defensively. A warm trickle ran through her belly at that moment, which was caused not so much by the tea as by the magnetic look that this tallish man in his middle years-slightly craggy of aspect, but well-dressed withal-cast upon her.</p>
   <p>'May I sit with you? We can converse more quietly, my dear?'</p>
   <p>Without waiting upon permission, Percival did so and found a warm hip agreeably close to his own. His eyes took in the fetching dimple on her cheek, the sweet corners of her mouth. How many times, he wondered, had those lustrous lips been kissed? How many times, if ever, had a hand-whether male or female-found its way into her corsage to fondle those magnificent orbs which appeared to strain so impatiently through her dress?</p>
   <p>'Upbraid?' he asked in a gentle tone. 'No, Miss Markham, such does not have a sufficient strain of strictness that the female needs. There are those I know who use the birch and cause the unveiled bottom to twist and burn. Cries of protest, of alarm, may be heard which in a quiet household are unseemly and may disturb those who had best know least about it. For myself, I employ mainly the tawse. Do you know of such?'</p>
   <p>Blushing deeply at his choice of words, Vanessa clutched rather desperately at her cup and gazed straight before her so that naught but her attractive profile was presented to his view. No one had ever spoken to her thus before and she knew not how to reply, though having rather mumbled something was politely asked what she had said.</p>
   <p>'I said no', she gulped.</p>
   <p>'Ah, then, I better understand, my dear. The tawse is a Scottish instrument of thick broad leather, alike unto a goodly luggage strap, if you will, but split at the <emphasis>instructive </emphasis>end so as to form two fingers. At the moment of their meeting the offered bottom…'</p>
   <p>'Oh, sir, I do not think we should speak of such!' Vanessa gasped.</p>
   <p>'Ah-I had no idea that you were uninstructed. Truly I had not. Pray forgive me. Are you well accommodated here? Is the residence roomy enough for you?'</p>
   <p>'Indeed yes. May I show you around?' Vanessa asked hastily as if she would rather do anything at that moment than continue such a conversation.</p>
   <p>'It would be pleasant, yes, and more than that, for I like to think of my parishioners at night at prayer, Miss Mark-ham, and thus do I envisage them-each and all-in their rooms of retirement, the fires lit in winter and a pleasant glow upon the ceiling. Is that not one of the jolliest and cosiest sights?' he asked, assisting her to rise and thereby brushing his hand down one svelte hip in the process.</p>
   <p>'I s… s… suppose, yes', the young woman responded. She had not thought to show him anything as intimate as her bedroom, but there seemed no escape from it. And thus a little tour was conducted-first the dining room, then the morning room and the small conservatory whose blooms the Vicar much admired-and then followed the hesitant moment when Vanessa conducted him up the stairs.</p>
   <p>In so doing, she distinctly felt his hand pass behind her and pass lightly over and beneath the noble cheeks of her bottom, the which she was quite unable to believe was happening. Being a well-brought-up young lady, she had experienced little of the like before, and most certainly not with a stranger. Such was her modesty, however, that she could not bring herself to remark upon that libertine straying of his palm which, through her gown, her petticoat, and her drawers, could well feel the warm rotundity of her nether cheeks.</p>
   <p>As they passed along the landing, the Vicar stole his encroaching fingers a little further beneath her orbs, this causing Vanessa to gulp audibly, though-as he had well anticipated-no word of protest broke from her lips simply because she knew not how to form such. From previous adventures, the wily cleric was well aware that such would be the case and literally guided her by her bottom into the first of several bedrooms, where, as she whispered almost inaudibly, her brother Reginald slept.</p>
   <p>'It is next to your own?' came the enquiry.</p>
   <p>'Sir, yes, but I do not think…', began Vanessa, finding words at last, for his insurgent fingers were by then pressing the various materials of her clothes and underclothes up into the plump bulge of her bottom in the most possessive way.</p>
   <p>'It is wise to have adjoining rooms, my dear, for should you be indisposed or have need, then you may quietly call upon him in the night-is that not so?'</p>
   <p>'B… but my room…', stammered Vanessa, whose facial cheeks were bright red while her nether ones could distinctly feel the commanding impress of his hand in a way that disturbed her much.</p>
   <p>'Is not so nice as this? Oh, but I am sure it is much prettier. Have no alarm at showing it to me for I frequently have had need to call upon my lady parishioners when they have cause to languish in bed and am in need of such attentions as I can give them. The door is here? Ah yes! I say, what a delightful room! You have a window-seat, I see. I have a great fancy for such. A double bed, too. Far more convenient than a single one, I always think. May I close the door? You were asking me, I believe, about the usages and effects of the tawse'.</p>
   <p>'No-no, I was not', Vanessa attempted to declare with some firmness whereat the Vicar boldly encircled her waist- slim, as he found it-and brought her with rather trembling legs to sit beside him on a decidedly bouncy bed.</p>
   <p>'We do not wish to be overheard, do we, Miss Markham? I am very well aware of the feminine interest in the subject, much as some young ladies of your own modesty wish to veil it'.</p>
   <p>'Yes, yes, I am very modest', Vanessa uttered gratefully at being able to pick up the word.</p>
   <p>'Though not so much so, I trust, as you will disdain a serious discussion on the matter? Do you feel faint, my dear? Lie back a moment', urged the Vicar while a whimper of remonstrance issued from Vanessa's lips as the movement of his arm-guiding her with seeming gentleness and yet withal a demanding strength-caused her back to meet the counterpane and her neatly shod feet to dangle off of the floor.</p>
   <p>Her lips parted in total wonderment that such a thing could be happening, Vanessa felt his free hand pass so swiftly and deftly up beneath her skirts that before a cry could escape her his palm had soothed around the slightly rough tops of her stockings and then essayed the rich milky skin above.</p>
   <p>'Ah, no!' Vanessa gasped. Her shoulders made to rise but sank down once more. Levering his wrist strongly between her resistant legs, Percival found that which he most sought- to wit, the warm mound of her cunny whose furry prominence mounded against the palrn which he commenced rubbing gently through the cotton of her drawers. 'S… sir, I do not w… want!' she protested, turning her head this way and that while the gentle massaging of the heel of his hand against her clitty caused her to grit her teeth and flush right down to her neck.</p>
   <p>'Lie still, Miss Markham, or I may need to demonstrate the use of the tawse on you sooner than I had expected', uttered Percival in such an authoritative tone as for a moment caused Vanessa to return to her even more youthful days when the commands of her Papa had been as those of the Deity. With a total sense of disbelief she felt him slide down as though he had dropped something upon the floor. Hence, believing such to be her moment of escape, she made again to rise and was producing the first flustered motions of so doing when both her uncovered legs were seized and-gripped firmly just above the knees by the Vicar's strong hands-were caused to dangle over his shoulders as he swiftly knelt before her.</p>
   <p>'HAAAR!' Vanessa cried, though biting her knuckles as she did so lest Mary should hear.</p>
   <p>The crafty cleric had counted much upon that and drove his hungry mouth immediately into the crotch of her drawers, feeling thereunder the rolled lips which impressed themselves through the cotton. Arching her back, her eyes wild, and clenching at the bedcover, Vanessa felt his lapping wetly there-indeed, just like a dog's. Bumping her sturdy, well-curved legs upon his shoulders, she gradually felt not only the crotch of her drawers wetting from his saliva but also the exudations that came from her honeypot.</p>
   <p>'MUR-MUR-MUR!' she began to moan, much to the joy of the cleric. The tip of his tongue actually caused the few loose folds of her drawers at their most critical juncture to enter between her rolled lovelips, at the peak of which he could distinctly feel her clitoris erecting like a small but eager bud.-'HOOO-OOOH! NO!' came to his ears, which cry was a further delight to him since he well knew that such was frequently uttered when the very reverse was intended.</p>
   <p>Gathering his hands under her bottom, he hastily sought the ties of her drawers and, tugging upon the waistband, brought that garment to descend to Vanessa's knees. His further action was then just as immediate and caught her by surprise as much as it had done other females in the past. Letting her legs slump heavily down, Percival rose and swiftly rolled the dazed young woman upon her face so that he was at last able to view the impressive twin demi-globes of her bottom.</p>
   <p>No more lustrous orb had ever met Percival's eyes. The cheeks inrolled with that tight plumpness that produces at their meeting point a faint gingery hue which adds such pleasing contrast to the marbled whiteness of the bulging peach. As such a fruit, so indeed it felt, the cheeks being velvety and firm as he caressed them, parted them and allowed an enquiring finger to run up and down the furrow at whose centre Vanessa haplessly showed her crinkled orifice.</p>
   <p>'GOOOOO!' came a wild sob from Vanessa whose hands now clawed forward as if she would drag herself beyond his reach.</p>
   <p>That, however, he forestalled by laying one hand firmly in the small of her back and bringing the other with a firm SMACK! on her naked bottom.</p>
   <p>'WHAAAAH!' choked she as the stinging impress of his palm and fingers caused a pink hue to stain the otherwise spotless pallor. At the same time, however-as her hips jerked resultantly-Vanessa's awoken clitoris rubbed teas-ingly upon the slightly ribbed surface of the bedcover, causing her to have two utterly opposing sensations, the which merged in the most curious way. At one and the same time her bottom burned and her belly seemed to be melting. Between her legs was a tiny pinpoint of white heat that had as equal an effect upon her as did the impact of that disciplinary palm. Her knuckles tightened and her flushed face was well hid.</p>
   <p>All this Percival well expected. Observing the fervent quivering of her nether cheeks, he caressed their hot surfaces suavely and then smacked her again, bringing a 'YEE-EEEK!' from Vanessa that was quieter than her precious utterances. Her hips wriggled wildly and a hissing sound emitted itself from her nostrils.</p>
   <p>One more would do her well, the Vicar decided. Her sobbings did not impress him at all, for her legs-having at first kicked rebelliously-now hung limp.</p>
   <p>Smack! came his hand again, bouncing as it did off the resilient moon which with that became an even deeper pink.</p>
   <p>'Nooo-hooo!' Vanessa squealed but once, and then the molten lava which had been gathering within her melted utterly, causing her well-furred pubis to grind itself wildly under the ridged material beneath her as she spilled her milky substance out in fierce little jets which at the last left her quivering, and indeed as if floating upon a roseate cloud.</p>
   <p>'I shall attend upon you again tomorrow, my dear, and at this time', she heard distantly and then felt something thrown upon the bed, though could not bring herself to turn her head and reveal even part of her buried face to him.-'You will place it beneath your pillow and there let it stay until I return, Miss Markham', were his departing words.</p>
   <p>Scarcely even conscious of where she was at that moment and feeling all the delightful creamy wetness under her, Vanessa lay utterly still as the door closed. Indeed, upon its doing so she did not then immediately rise but remained in a daze of wonderment exactly as Percival intended her to.</p>
   <p>Descending the stairs slowly and magisterially, he found Mary hastening into the hall.</p>
   <p>'Oh, sir, are you leaving?'</p>
   <p>'I am indeed, my girl, and your Mistress desires not to be disturbed. She is in a state of rest, a state of grace indeed', the Vicar announced to the open-mouthed young maid who from his words somehow envisaged Miss Markham as being dressed in angel's attire and floating about her bedroom.</p>
   <p>As the door closed upon their visitor, Mary crept to the foot of the stairs and listened, but she could hear not a sound from above and, after a moment's curiosity, returned to her domestic chores.</p>
   <p>As for Vanessa, she curled herself up slowly, drawing her legs on to the bed and biting the corner of one of her pillows. Her bottom burned and her cunny tingled still. There was a lump behind her at her hip and she felt blindly with one hand, finding therewith the curled tawse that he had dropped beside her.</p>

    <p>Chapter Two</p>
   </title>
   <p>Reginald Markham returned blithely from his first day of teaching at St. Hilda's where there was such a bevy of girls as had faintly but guiltily stirred his loins several times. The movements of his buttocks upon the saddle had but excited his vagrant thoughts more-much as he strove to suppress them-and, despite his thirty-five years, it was with a sense of boyish consciousness that he led his horse into the paddock and waited a long moment until the tingling in his thickened tool had subsided.</p>
   <p>Upon his entering the house, Mary came to offer to him what she thought of as a proper curtsey-proper that is to her due station in life-which movement caused her cap, as usual, to come askew and her firm young titties to bobble beneath her dress in the same manner that had met the Vicar's searching eyes.</p>
   <p>'Mistress is upstairs, sir, she is resting, in a state of grace, he said', Mary uttered all in one breath and priding herself much on remembering the phrase despite her failure to understand what it meant.</p>
   <p>'In a what?' replied Reggie comically, but then seeing the girl's crestfallen expression, he added, 'Yes, of course, Mary. I will go up and make my arrival known and meanwhile a pot of tea would do us all good, would it not?'</p>
   <p>'Oh yes, sir!' Mary responded enthusiastically, finding herself apparently included in the plural. Hardly twenty minutes had passed since the Vicar had departed and the Master should have met him on the road, she thought, but then gave herself the extra one that the reverend gentleman must have gone the other way.</p>
   <p>Reginald was always a quiet walker (and had frequently been reprimanded in his youth for 'stealing up' on people, albeit unconsciously). Vanessa thus did not hear him ascending and was at that moment not so much in a state of 'grace' as of bewildered fervour. Having kicked off her drawers, she had removed her dress also and had cast it similarly upon the floor, thereafter crawling beneath the bedclothes in an effort to blot out from her mind the outrageous events that had passed. So far from being able to do so, however, her thoughts had dwelt continually on the tonguings, handlings and smackings she had received. Telling herself that she knew not what she was doing, she had closed her eyes, clawed the spare pillow down under the sheet and held it closely up under her cunny where its soft and smooth texture afforded her a distinct if exciting comfort.</p>
   <p>It was not until the bedroom door opened that Vanessa appeared to return to her full senses, made to sit up and then-remembering her state of undress-sank quickly down again and peered over the edge of the bedclothes at her brother, who regarded her flushed face and tousled hair with wondering.</p>
   <p>'My dear, are you well?' he asked.</p>
   <p>The V… V… Vicar came', stammered Vanessa as if that were a sufficient excuse for her condition. 'I mean, he came and then I lay down and then-oh Reggie-I feel so strange!' burst she, producing a veritable flood of tears which caused him such concern that he immediately sat beside her on the bed and passed his hand across her moist forehead.</p>
   <p>'What ails you, then?'</p>
   <p>'I do not know, honestly I do not and-oh, forgive me', Vanessa uttered as his straying eyes fell to her drawers and crumpled dress.</p>
   <p>As Reggie looked, he in turn flushed, for the drawers had by chance fallen in an 'open' position with the frilled legs apart and a distinct patch of moisture showing at the crotch.</p>
   <p>'Ah', said he with something of a gurgle in his voice, for it must be said that, being only human, he had frequently heard the mysterious and not uninviting little sounds made by his voluptuously-bodied sister as she undressed. Now and then he had (all despite himself) imagined her attired only in a waist corset or stockings, and had even-with such guiltiness as often came upon him-envisaged her removing the very garment on which his eyes stayed.</p>
   <p>'You wish the doctor?' he asked solicitously, a movement of his body then causing the bedclothes to glide down to reveal momentarily to his awoken gaze the creamy gourds of his sister's breasts whereon her pointed brown nipples peaked sharply and indeed, as it seemed to him, almost beseechingly.</p>
   <p>'Oh no, no, no, it is nothing like that. I will be well tomorrow', said Vanessa unwittingly and then recalled the Vicar's parting words with such a start that she failed not only to cover her luscious titties but had quite forgotten the tawse which lay beside her and upon which Reggie's hand next fell.</p>
   <p>'What is this?' he asked, curiously fingering the thick but pliable leather.</p>
   <p>'Oh, don't know! Why do you keep asking questions?' Vanessa responded all but hysterically, then seeing his face fall she added more quietly, 'It is just a strap, I suppose. Mary found it behind a cabinet'.</p>
   <p>'A strange one, indeed, for the end is split and there is no buckle to it I will take it downstairs if you wish'.</p>
   <p>So saying, and being in fact rather at a loss to account for his sister's unusual behaviour, Reggie drew it up in the same instant that Vanessa turned to reach for it, with the result that one exposed and heavy tit brushed silkily against his hand, causing her nipple to stub against it in the process.</p>
   <p>'Oh, Reggie!' Vanessa said as if in great dismay, and he withdrawing his hand hastily if regretfully.</p>
   <p>'S… sorry!' Reggie stammered, 'I will-er-that is to say, see if tea is made and then-er-yes…'</p>
   <p>And so mumbling and not a little pink about the cheeks, Reggie made his departure, leaving behind the tawse which Vanessa quickly thrust under the pillow beneath her head. Thankful that her brother had not observed that the other headrest was missing, she drew it up from between her extremely warm and moist thighs and lay back for a moment with a sigh, her bottom stirring on the sheet beneath her as if in memory of the most astonishing day in her life.</p>
   <p>Reggie meanwhile had sauntered into the kitchen where Mary was in process of lifting the kettle from the hob. The deuce of it was that his prick had thickened up again and he wondered whether the girl would see it. She had a fine young bottom, he told himself, and he had viewed quite a number that day, albeit clothed.</p>
   <p>'That was a funny strap you found, Mary', he said while she poured hot water into the teapot.</p>
   <p>'I, sir? I didn't find one'.</p>
   <p>'The one with a split end, you know, that you found behind a cabinet', said Reggie patiently.</p>
   <p>'No, sir, honestly, cross my heart and hope to die-I didn't find nothing, I didn't', Mary said in the manner of one being accused of a great crime.</p>
   <p>'Ah, well then, frightfully sorry, must have misunderstood', came the mumble of one who was even more confused.</p>
   <p>'I 'spect the Vicar found it or left it or something like that, if the Mistress didn't', Mary offered with bright innocence, this causing Reggie to gawp somewhat for he could not imagine what a reverend gentleman would be doing with such a thing about his person. There was clearly something odd afoot which he could not fathom. Or at least not for a long moment. In fact it was not until he was sipping his tea that a distant memory swam back to him. He had perhaps been only about twelve at the time and had been staying with Vanessa at their Uncle Frederick's house. Running indoors from the garden to get himself a glass of water, Reggie had heard smack-slapping noises and squeals emanating from the morning room and had tiptoed towards it to see what was afoot.</p>
   <p>Just at that moment his aunt had swept out of the selfsame room, her face not a little flushed, and behind her he had glimpsed-but for a brief moment-one of the servant girls bent over the table, her skirt to her hips and his uncle standing behind and to one side of her and steadily strapping her naked bottom with-yes! — by jove, that strap had looked much the same as the one on Vanessa's bed.</p>
   <p>Thoroughly bemused, Reggie put his cup down and took his quiet way up the stairs once more, this time surprising his sister in an even greater fashion. Vanessa felt both humiliated and exhilarated and could not make up her mind which feeling was uppermost, much as she had tried to make the former the stronger emotion. Thus she had swung her legs out of the bed and sat for a moment holding them open precisely at the moment that Reggie made his entry.</p>
   <p>'Oh! Oh, Reggie!' Vanessa ejaculated, though too late to hide that which his eyes had never before fallen upon- which is of course to say the fur of her thicket, beneath which he could just glimpse her pouting slit.-'Really, Reggie!' she expostulated, jumping up and thereby causing the lacy hem of her petticoat to flow upwards and outwards even more revealingly so that the full vision of her stockinged thighs, her hips, her nest and part of her bulbing bottom were all to be blissfully seen before she hastily tugged the garment down again.</p>
   <p>'I say, Vanessa, that strap!' said Reggie who was not to be put off and indeed felt the blood trilling in his veins at the revelations of his sister's luscious semi-nudity.</p>
   <p>'Strap? Strap? Oh, go away! Really, you shouldn't see me like this, Reggie!' protested Vanessa who could not fail to see in turn the protrusion that was by then so marked beneath his trousers.</p>
   <p>'Well, Mary did not find it-that was all I was going to say', her brother answered shamefacedly.</p>
   <p>'Ho! Is that all? I found it on my bed and I thought she did', Vanessa replied all too quickly and could have bitten off her words, for in view of the fact that only one visitor had appeared that day the conclusion to Reggie was that something very odd had occurred.</p>
   <p>'Your bottom is red, Vanessa', he blurted.</p>
   <p>'What? Eh? Reggie, how dare you say such a thing to me, and how dare you look! Mary, Mary-please come and help me dress', Vanessa called out frantically, wishing even more to be rid of this conversation than that her brother should have seen her naked derriere. Backing away and holding her petticoat tightly across the front of her thighs, she watched then dry-mouthed as he grabbed at the tawse which was coyly showing its tail from under her skewed pillow and made his exit with the air of one who had filched the Crown Jewels while Vanessa's beseeching 'Reggie!' followed him down the stairs.</p>
   <p>En route, he inevitably bumped into Mary who was hastening up in some wonder.</p>
   <p>'Mary, I say, I believe she is in an excitable state. Do what you can to quieten her', he whispered.</p>
   <p>'Yes, sir', answered the maid conspiratorially. In passing him her thigh sidled against Reggie's erection, the which caused both of them to start and he to fear that Mary would cry out. Instead, though, she bit her lip as though to conceal a not displeased grimace and even offered him a pert little grin over her shoulder as she went to enter Vanessa's room.</p>
   <p>The minx, Reggie thought, but the deuce of it would be that she would now wonder why his prick was up, particularly in view of Vanessa's state of undress. Life was getting oddly complicated all of a sudden and he had no desire to stay in the house for a while. Besides which, he was holding the damned strap, and Mary would have seen it.</p>
   <p>The only person left to see was the Vicar himself and it was to the Vicarage that Reggie took himself, though scarce knowing what he was going to say on arriving, and with his spirits rather descending the closer that he rode there. Even so, as he told himself, he could but say that he was returning the cleric's visit and see what, if anything, he had to say about Vanessa's strange behaviour.</p>
   <p>Knocking hesitantly upon arrival, he was let in by Maude, the housekeeper-a buxom woman who kept herself 'in trim', as she always declared and was frequently pumped by the Vicar's powerful cock when he had no one else to attend to. For such services, Maude was well rewarded, and more so since she occasionally assisted in the 'conversion' of girls who came to prepare themselves for communion or something of the like.</p>
   <p>One such at that very moment was immured with the Vicar, and Reggie heard a distinct squeak coming from behind the study door.</p>
   <p>'I believe as the Reverend is engaged at the moment, sir', said Maude with considerable understatement, 'But if you was to wait!..'</p>
   <p>'Who is it, Maude?' then boomed the Vicar's voice whereat the housekeeper uttered Reggie's full name, this producing a momentary thoughtful silence until the order came, 'Then show him in'.</p>
   <p>'Oh-wer!' uttered the young girl who at that very moment struggled to push down her dress even as the door was opened, whereat the visitor was accorded the most fetching of visions-albeit momentary-of the slim legs and pouting pussy of one scarce seventeen whose face was bright red and her bottom pink.</p>
   <p>'You were naughty and you have learned your lesson, have you not, Sally?' the Vicar asked of her before addressing Reggie.</p>
   <p>A sound came from the girl that might have been yes or no. Reggie was not sure which. Her head bowed, the girl rushed passed him, though-unseen by him-was quickly gathered into the arms of Maude who swiftly bustled her into the drawing room, there to give her what she fondly called 'a little talk', which was more in praise of Priapus than of prayer, though always delicately put and which caused most of the girls to believe that the finest anointment they could receive was that from the thick and spermaceous emissions of the Vicar's prick.</p>
   <p>'Ah, yes, dear fellow-how nice of you to return my visit. A whiskey, eh? Or a brandy-or maybe a glass of wine', Percival began, flooding his visitor with words while causing him to subside into a chair. Eccentrically, or not, and without waiting for a reply, he thereupon dowsed two glasses with a spirited measure of malt whiskey and placed one into the rather dazed younger man's hand.</p>
   <p>'V… Vanessa…', stumbled Reggie who had no idea now of what he was going to say and whose pocket was bulging with the rolled tawse.</p>
   <p>'Yes?' enquired the cleric gently.</p>
   <p>"Well, I… that is to say… odd state I found her in, and-pray forgive me, sir, this curious strap', Reggie said, producing it. Swallowing hastily from his glass while Percival waited patiently, he added as though in compromise, 'I say, did you find her odd?'</p>
   <p>At that, the Vicar seated himself on the front edge of his desk and gazed down benignly at his visitor.</p>
   <p>'May I speak to you, if not as a father, than as an older and more experienced man?' he asked.</p>
   <p>At that, Reggie rather wilted and nodded.</p>
   <p>'A cigar? Have a cigar, dear boy, and I will join you. The pleasures of enveloping oneself in fragrant smoke are infinite. May I call you Reggie? I address all my parishioners as fondly as I can. Here, let me light it for you-if the dashed lucifer works and, yes, it does. Rather good, eh? From Cuba, I am told, or is it Havana-I am never quite sure. You were saying?'</p>
   <p>'About, about my sister, yes', Reggie stumbled and rather wished he had not come.</p>
   <p>'Vanessa, is it not?' the Vicar asked as if all about him were a distant memory. Puffing on his cigar and leaning forward in the most confidential manner, he murmured, 'We may speak frankly? Man to man? As a learned man yourself, I am sure you treasure directness of speech rather than evasions. She was-and I tell you this in all confidence, dear boy-in heat. She was in such a state of undress as would have beguiled a saint. I saw naught for it but to cool her ardour as one must with many young ladies-to wit, by smacking her bottom. Oh, I do not deny it. The tawse is mine, or rather is your sister's now, for I left it with her. And to what purpose, eh?'</p>
   <p>'I say! I really don't know', blurted Reggie who had never heard the like of such a conversation.</p>
   <p>'Consider, Reggie, that she is a spinster, and a remarkable figure of one, I must say. Such females deny themselves that of which they are most in need. I have known them to open their legs and rub themselves against bedroom doors in their secret frenzies'.</p>
   <p>'Have you?' asked his listener in astonishment.</p>
   <p>'You found her unclothed-without her drawers on?' came the countering question during which the Vicar's gaze so piercingly encountered Reggie's that the latter blushed. A hand was laid as if comfortingly upon his shoulder. For a moment Reggie felt exceedingly small.</p>
   <p>'Were I to say more, dear boy, you might take great offence, though I find myself having to advise many in such matters', the Vicar sighed heavily and sent another bloom of smoke into the air.</p>
   <p>Floundering for something to say, but in all the circumstances finding little to doubt in the speaker's words, Reggie muttered, 'Yes, I suppose', and took another hasty swallow.-'I suppose she was jolly embarassed', he added for want of anything else to say and feeling thereby that he had at least put up some defence on his sister's part.</p>
   <p>Again the heavy voice fell about his ears.</p>
   <p>'What is important, Reggie, is that she acceded to her punishment, brief as I caused it to be. Your maid offered no complaint to you of any distress on the part of her Mistress?'</p>
   <p>'Oh no, none', Reggie responded truthfully, and that giving him something more to chew upon, for it was quite remarkable if Vanessa had her gorgeous bottom smacked and scarce a sound heard.</p>
   <p>'The truth, you see-the ultimate truth with all females- is that they know what they need but will never confess it. Being dealt with in a manner that one might call parental- stem at the very least-they succumb. Their bottoms are dutifully though often rebelliously offered. The hand or the strap burns and stirs them. Their hips churn, their titties harden. Did you observe her nipples and, mayhap, the excited state in which they remained?'</p>
   <p>'I-er-yes', Reggie responded all too hastily and then regretted the confession.</p>
   <p>There are conclusions to be drawn therefrom, albeit only in the deepest confidence that now exists between us and which I swear will never stray beyond these walls. Do I have need to say what they are?'</p>
   <p>'That… that she will require more of-er…'</p>
   <p>'Precisely, dear boy, precisely, for she has reached that height of tempestuous desire that may be quelled only by the most manly applications of two weapons-the one artificial, such as this leather instrument, and the other which is natural to our beings. I refer, bluntly-since I must-to the cock. Has she not been put to it? It is a dire sin to leave a full-hipped woman thus. Unless, of course, you wish to have these daily upheavals and alarms?'</p>
   <p>'I do not know. That is to say, I am not sure', stammered Reggie whose ears burned as much as did his mind at such frank talk.</p>
   <p>'Better that I should have come straight to the point than to have fenced around. It is the removal to a new house which sets them going, doncherknow. New rooms, new beds, desires arising. There have been many such hereabouts in these past years-daughters, sisters and young wives, and all must needs be attended to. Regular juicings are what they need-regular juicings. Such as are unmarried, and even some whose husbands do not do their duty regularly, must have their due. Some show great promise upon being tawsed and having their cunnies or their bottoms plugged. What an advantage you do have, old chap, at St. Hilda's, have you not?'</p>
   <p>The question at first jolted Reggie who gave a rather blurred impression of not having thought about it, though indeed he had.</p>
   <p>'There are some among them who will come to me for various-er-preparations. Of such I will advise you, of course, and again in the strictest confidence. If one does not do one's duty to them, others will, y'know', the Vicar said.</p>
   <p>'Yes', said Reggie, rather open-mouthed, adding with a lopsided grin, 'And some are jolly attractive, I must say'.</p>
   <p>'It is good to hear you say so. I frequently need a male confidant in such matters-one whom I can thoroughly trust, eh what? The very girl you saw departing just now has her cunny and her bottom both tickled up a little. She is coy, is wriggly, but on the whole is quiet and will behave herself, I am sure, when you bury your penis in and sperm her joyfully'.</p>
   <p>'I?' answered Reggie in apparent astonishment.</p>
   <p>'Would such not be the purpose of our partnership? She is due to come here again on-let me see-ah yes, Thursday evening. It occurs to me that were you to be here, you might well wish to test the tightness of her bottom cheeks, or mount her otherwise between her thighs'. 'My gosh, but will there not be a fuss about such?'</p>
   <p>'A fuss? Goodness me, no. There is much to be said for the reverential and quiet air of a vicarage, old chap. They arrive here duly meek, and have been told to come. If they are to squall a little, better that they should do so here and not elsewhere. They will be quieter in their own beds then, when they are duly saddled, will they not? Come, let us drink to the happy thought'.</p>
   <p>Refilling Reggie's glass, the Vicar then strode to the door and opening it called for Maude who entered apronless, for she was just about to depart to visit her young married daughter.</p>
   <p>'Mr. Markham will be joining us in a certain capacity occasionally, Maude. Young Sally is coming again on Thursday, is she not? I suggest you accord Mr. Markham the tuitional bedroom. He will receive the girl after I have warmed her bottom up a bit and will anoint her accordingly.'</p>
   <p>'Why, sir, yes, sir, that will be nice. I am sure she's going to enjoy it the first time, and with such a nice young gentleman. If you needs it, sir, I'll hold her, but mostly it ain't necessary', added Maude helpfully to Reggie, who, half-risen from his chair, sank back again in dumb astonishment.</p>
   <p>'Thank you, Maude, I know you will always do your duty. Your daughter now-is she faring as well as she should?'</p>
   <p>'Well, sir, between you and me and these four walls…'</p>
   <p>'My dear, you need say no more. What a pity that such agile hips as hers should go to waste-but then of course they must not. A mere twenty, Reggie, and a perfect pearl of a girl. Perhaps Friday, Maude?'</p>
   <p>'Yes, sir, and I'll have her come'.</p>
   <p>'I'll be the one to do that, Maude, and so perhaps will our Mr. Markham.'</p>
   <p>'Oh, sir, you are one!' giggled Maude and then, receiving a pat on her ample bottom from her fond employer, departed while giving Reggie a quite flirtatious look.</p>
   <p>'My goodness!' the latter ejaculated as the door closed.</p>
   <p>'A fine woman-an understanding one', the Vicar averred as though the conversation had been a perfectly proper one. 'Thursday, then', he went on, extending his hand to Reggie who by then was so utterly convinced of all that he felt he had entered an entirely new world. Tapping out the ash from his half-smoked cigar, he gazed beyond the Vicar and asked with all the vagueness that he could contrive, 'And as to the problem of Vanessa?'</p>
   <p>'The very fact that we are now agreed upon matters precludes any further problem. Pray return the tawse to her room, though you need to say nothing to her on the matter. She will know well enough what the renewed sight of it means, for I have promised-and I make no bones about it-that I will attend on her again tomorrow. You will find her bottom even hotter than before, and of course I shall have attended to her otherwise. She will be flushed and abed, I believe, on your return. Have no nonsense from her. Draw such confessions from her as you wish and then give her a good pumping'.</p>
   <p>'B… but Mary…', stammered Reggie.</p>
   <p>'Why yes, of course. There is no need to leave her out of things, dear boy, is there?' counselled the Vicar gravely and then guided him without.</p>

    <p>Chapter Three</p>
   </title>
   <p>A sense of devil-may-care ran deeply in the veins of Reginald Markham on his return. Intoxicated by thoughts of what was to be, he entered the house quietly, expecting Vanessa to have returned to bed, but by then she had regained her composure and, in her outward self, was as placid as she had first been upon the arrival of the Vicar.</p>
   <p>No longer, however, was she the same young woman, as she well knew. Always introspective and hence often a dreamer, she felt herself now to have been shifted into a new and different compartment of life. The appearance of her brother in the drawing room, wearing a brasher air than he normally had, gave her reason to believe that he, too, had suffered a sea-change, so that her immediate and stiffly-put question to him immediately was, 'Where have you been?'</p>
   <p>'I returned the Vicar's visit', replied Reggie calmly, though inwardly he was trembling with excitement.</p>
   <p>Even to Vanessa it seemed that his eyes pierced the brown and white gown she had donned, seeing beneath it the ivory columns of her thighs, the proud thrusting of her breasts whose hot nipple he had felt brushing his hand, the cleft between her wondrous buttocks, and the hairy dell that nestled so invitingly between her thighs.</p>
   <p>'Why?' Vanessa asked, producing a slight tremble in her voice that was real enough.</p>
   <p>Despite what he had been advised to do, Reggie then drew from his bulging pocket what Vanessa had in fact tremulously sensed was already there. Tossed into her lap, the thick strap slithered like a snake and then hung its head down the side of her leg, causing her expression to become frozen.</p>
   <p>'You are to replace it beneath your pillow where I found it, Vanessa. It will be required tomorrow'.</p>
   <p>'wh… aaaart?' Her fingers trembled in touching it and then fell away.</p>
   <p>Bravado still upon him, and in the manner of a man who thinks he can conquer the world with but a stick in his hand, Reggie fell to his knees before her and to a smothered screech from Vanessa ran both hands upwards beneath her voluminous skirt and assailed the creamy surfaces of her thighs where he could also so excitingly feel her garters and her stocking tops.</p>
   <p>So swift and unexpected was the assault that for a frenzied moment Vanessa felt much as she had done with the Vicar in her bedroom. Instead of fending her brother off, she bit her knuckles to prevent herself from crying out for Mary. Even as he endeavoured to force her legs apart, her face went wildly to the door, but it was closed and all beyond was quiet.</p>
   <p>'He will attend upon you again, Vanessa, and you will again remove your drawers when he does so and…'</p>
   <p>'You brute! What has come over you! Oh my God, no, you dare!' came her cry as the fingers of his right hand succeeded in insinuating themselves between the upper silky surfaces of her thighs to caress the cunnylips that protruded so boldly through the fresh batiste drawers Vanessa had donned. Feeling their emergent moisture through the material, Reggie grew even more enraged with desire and made to dip his head beneath her upraised skirt.</p>
   <p>'hah! no! mary-eeee!' Vanessa screeched at the top of her voice and with such rending volume that an appalled Reggie immediately scrambled to his feet and cast open the door just as the maid appeared upon the threshold.</p>
   <p>'Yes, ma'am, what is it?' Mary asked anxiously, trying to peer past Reggie who successfully blocked her view.</p>
   <p>'Nothing, Mary-we were merely playing. Will supper be ready soon?' Reggie asked in as steady a voice as he could control.</p>
   <p>'Yes, sir, but…</p>
   <p>'Be a good girl then and do your tasks', Reggie commanded, trying to ape the manner of the Vicar while Va-nessa sat trembling and silent, and thankfully beyond the view of Mary whom she had so involuntarily called. Yet even as her brother closed the door again, she gathered herself and rose, her face flushed and her breasts rising and falling. Such was the expression on her face that her brother's countenance fell.</p>
   <p>'Dearest…', he began weakly.</p>
   <p>'I shall take supper in my room', Vanessa replied stiffly and all but thrust him aside with her arm so that Reggie was caught between apprehension and anger at having been so thwarted.</p>
   <p>'Then you had best take this', he rejoined, snatching up the tawse which had fallen to the floor and thrusting it into her hand.</p>
   <p>'Oh, is that what you want?' Vanessa sneered. She was minded to cast it down again, but upon thinking that Mary might see it and that in any case it was better in her possession than his, she swept proudly and swiftly from the room, leaving Reggie rather aghast at the wilfulness of his actions which had followed like a wave upon his visit to the vicarage.</p>
   <p>Better to have followed the Vicar's advice, he told himself mournfully, for he could no longer conceal from himself his lust for his beautiful sister while as for Vanessa herself she found herself caught between bewilderment and her own arisen desires which her body could no longer deny. So fraught with tension was she that upon reaching her room, she rang for Mary who came up at a trot.</p>
   <p>'What, ma'am?' Mary asked, finding her Mistress seated and looking woebegone.</p>
   <p>The intuitions of a female are sharp and Mary herself knew that something strange was afoot, though she could not fathom what.</p>
   <p>'Mary, I will have supper up here, and then pray will you stay with me tonight for I feel restless and strange'.</p>
   <p>'Ma'am?' blurted Mary to whom such a request was overwhelming. Quickly enough she gathered herself, however, for she suspected that all had something to do with what had just occurred downstairs, and hence she answered, 'Oh yes, I would like to. Whenever you retire, ma'am, I will come up immediately'.</p>
   <p>'Thank you, Mary', Vanessa replied faintly, and thus Reggie partook of a lonely supper, smoked another cigar, drank several whiskies with bravado and told himself smugly that Vanessa had at least obeyed in returning the tawse to her room. She jolly well knew what she was going to have now, he thought, and stomped up to bed without so much as a goodnight to Mary who sniffingly told herself that it was all his fault.</p>
   <p>No sooner had Reggie entered his room than the waiting maid followed in his footsteps and entered Vanessa's room with a sense of awe and excitement. Vanessa lay abed already, saying in a seemingly weary voice, 'Hurry, Mary'.</p>
   <p>'Yes, Ma'am'.</p>
   <p>From that moment on an electric atmosphere seemed to fill the darkened room. With a curiosity, shy but eager as it was, Vanessa turned lazily in the bed and watched the nubile young girl casting off her dress. Dim as Mary's figure was, it looked even more alluring to the young woman who saw to her surprise how slim the young girl was, how firm her melon-like titties and how apple-round her bottom. Even as Mary began to discard her petticoat and uttered, 'Oh, ma'am, I forgot my nightdress', Vanessa replied softly, 'It's all right', and reached out an arm to her, drawing the naked maid into her bed which Mary found deliciously warm and soft.</p>
   <p>What happened next could only occur between intense lovers or two females whose silent understanding is complete. Their lips met in a quivering of desire, bringing Vanessa to pass her hand up and down Mary's thighs and to mould her fine silky hips. Not a word passing between them and only the hurried breathing from their mouths betokening the coming of a storm, their tongues met, whereat a thoroughly excited Mary immediately passed her own hand up beneath Vanessa's cloudy nightgown and found the velvety orb of her bottom.</p>
   <p>'Mary, I feel so excited', Vanessa choked, for the words had wanted to burst from her for hours now.</p>
   <p>Mary did not answer immediately. Their tongues coiled again, twisting each about the other's in a languor of passion. Quite unable to resist what she considered to be yet another forbidden moment, Vanessa moved Mary's lax thighs apart and passed a wondering finger up between the moist lips of her cunny.</p>
   <p>'Nnnnng!' Mary gritted in delight. As they rolled and clung together-their bouncy titties bulging gelatinously together and their nipples rubbing-so Mary's errant forefinger trailed bewitchingly up and down the furrow of Va-nessa's magnificent bottom, causing her a multitude of strange sensations. While Vanessa's own finger slipped up within Mary's oily pouch, so the maid's rotated gently around her Mistress's tightly-rimmed bumhole in the manner of one who toys around the rim of a glass.</p>
   <p>Such an ecstatic quivering did this afford Vanessa that she drove her long tongue more wildly into Mary's warm, moist mouth and half rolled upon her so that their legs interlocked and their lewd caresses continued.</p>
   <p>Bucking her bottom gently, Mary felt herself about to come and moaned, circling one arm around Vanessa's neck while dipping the tip of her finger up into her Mistress's nether aperture and then moving but an inch of it back and forth while their salivas mingled.</p>
   <p>At first the insertion of Mary's fingertip in her bottomhole gave Vanessa a tickly-tingling feeling and she almost reached back to push it out, but slowly all sensations melted into one. Slipping more between Mary's thighs and ceasing to tickle her cunt with her digit, Vanessa began instead-and purely by instinct since she had never done such a thing before-to rub her lovelips against the equally pouting ones of her maid.</p>
   <p>To this, Mary responded by drawing her legs up and wrapping them high about Vanessa's waist so that their furry slits met the more succulently until both were breathing harder. By then also Mary's finger was easing more deeply back and forth in Vanessa's channel, the which caused her Mistress, after several quivering moments, to spurt her fine juices all around the maid's quim. Mary responding, their sticky exudations met in a little flood which oiled the inner surfaces of their thighs.</p>
   <p>Both moaned, both twisted, writhed violently, this causing the headboard of the bed to tap incessantly against the wall between Reggie's room and his sister's. For long moments his ears had been alert. He had distinctly heard the maid enter Vanessa's room, but had not heard her depart, and his cock was stiff, his balls swollen. At the sound which came to him, which at first seemed like the tapping of a stick against the wall, he started up, cast the bedclothes back and stole out onto the landing, cursing the creaking of a floorboard, though the two occupants of the adjoining bedroom were beyond hearing such.</p>
   <p>Dare he enter-should he enter, Reggie wondered, and at the same time cursed himself for such indecision. He could hear moans now-distinct moans-and his penis thrummed violently. Turning the doorhandle with such overdone caution that it rattled more than it would have normally done, Reggie ventured within and looked immediately sideways to the bed.</p>
   <p>In their raptures of desire, the two females had kicked the bedclothes down to their ankles and hence the most bewitching sight was afforded him of Vanessa's naked bottom rolling vigourously while the maid's calves were crossed tightly about her waist.</p>
   <p>Had she but known it, this posture saved Vanessa's immediate honour. Becoming aware of her brother's presence, she uttered a wail of despair and at the same time rolled completely over so that it was Mary who came uppermost and thus presented the immediate target for Reggie's amour-ous tool.</p>
   <p>'Oh, ma'am!' blurted Mary while Vanessa, in order to keep as much of herself covered as she was able to, continued to hold the maid tightly between her legs which she bent so that her knees gripped the girl's waist.</p>
   <p>'Go away!' Vanessa wailed to her brother who in the heat of the moment already had his nightshirt gathered up and was, however dimly in the lampless boudoir, already displaying his straining cock and balls.</p>
   <p>'My beauties!' Reggie chanted wildly and to a shriek from both was upon the bed in a flash, so positioning himself behind the wriggling Mary that the swollen nose of his cock immediately nubbed up beneath her thoroughly moistened quim.</p>
   <p>'Stop it!' Vanessa shrieked while hugging Mary upon her the more so that Reggie might not even see her swollen titties.</p>
   <p>Nothing, however, could have stayed Reggie from his desire to poke one or the other and hence, taking Mary's sleek hips and stilling them as well as he could, he pointed his poker up more against her honeypot and eased his vibrant stave with eye-squeezing delight into her oily channel until with one long thrust it was embedded and his balls hung down beneath her bottom.</p>
   <p>Delirious with excitement, Mary received his throbbing stave with a whimper of pleasure, the meaning of which could not escape even Vanessa, who buried her hot face in the girl's neck and moaned wildly, 'No, Mary, no!'</p>
   <p>'Whoooo!' the maid moaned in turn for already (and, it might be said, with undue but excusable haste) Reggie's cock had already begun to slew back and forth in her clinging cunny. Resultantly, Mary bit passionately at the lobe of Vanessa's ears, causing the latter to squeak in a crazed wonderment of despair that she could so unwittingly have entered into such an orgy.</p>
   <p>Being well-lodged and working passionately, Reggie was then able to pass one hand between the pair and tickle his sister's furry mound a little, though not as much as he would have wished, for the upper bulge of Mary's bush was also rubbing against it while her bottom churned to his manly thrusts.</p>
   <p>In all the frenzy of that moment, Mary boldly grasped Vanessa's face between her hands and slipped her tongue into the young woman's blurry mouth.</p>
   <p>'Ah, Mary, what a cunt you have, what a bottom! Wriggle it, my dear, for I am coming soon. I cannot help myself!' groaned Reggie who, over-excited as he was at this triple coupling, could perhaps have been excused his haste.</p>
   <p>'Glooop!' came from Mary whose breath was flooding into Vanessa's hapless mouth. Her hips thrust back a little to allow Reggie's hand to explore the oily, flesh folds of his sister's slit, for Mary sensed well enough that such was also what he wanted to do and did not wish to deny her Mistress the pleasure, as she thought of it.</p>
   <p>In her own condition-or so she told herself-Vanessa was by no means certain whose fingers were exciting her dell and in the frenetic seconds of mutual threshing that ensued she did not care, for she was coming again herself. Indeed, her legs rose higher, permitting Reggie to insert his finger right up her cunt, but then-as if reminding herself of the impossible wickedness of her posture and while Mary's titties bounced and jiggled their hard nipples against her own-Vanessa straightened down her legs again. Closing her eyes while her lips continued to mesh with Mary's, she heard her brother uttering a long-quivering cry.</p>
   <p>Or rather it should be said that it was an animal moan. Feeling the first thick shoot of his come splashing and bubbling in the interior of her suckingly-eager slit, Mary pressed the hot sphere of her delicious derriere tightly into his stomach as if to absorb the spermatic onrush as deeply as she could, and indeed did.</p>
   <p>Feeling his throbbing stem gripped between the silky walls of her cunny, Reggie groaned his delight while the burning spurts jetted from him and Mary rotated her smooth orb in a fashion that amazed and delighted him. As his emissions finally weakened, so Reggie continued valiantly pumping still and then, with deep tremors of exquisite release, held his cock sheathed to the full.</p>
   <p>Upon that delicious climax, Vanessa had twisted her mouth from under Mary's and clawed a pillow half over her face, moaning once again, 'Oh, stop, stop-go away!' and such an hysterical pitch sounding in her voice that Mary fell flat upon her in a comforting mode, thus causing Reggie's expended tool to slip from her lubricious grip.</p>
   <p>'Sir, go away, yes', Mary gasped, fearful then of her Mistress's reactions and the way that Vanessa was desperately continuing to cover her face.</p>
   <p>Reggie then of course wished much to simply roll upon his back beside the pair in the hope that he might continue to fondle both, but so vigourous had been his emission that an exhaustion seized him and he felt, too, that a terrible scene might ensue were he to stay.</p>
   <p>'I will just g… go to my room', he mumbled foolishly while several broken sobs came from beneath the muffling pillow over Vanessa's face. Easing himself back off the end of the bed, he gazed forlornly at the huddled pair for a moment and then with a huge sigh, as if the world had done badly by him-or perhaps as if to mitigate his apparent wickedness-he took himself out with such dignity as he could muster.</p>
   <p>Then only did Vanessa permit Mary to uncover her face.</p>
   <p>'Oh, I am sorry!' the young woman bleated while Mary slipped from off her but lay with one leg crooked over Vanessa's.</p>
   <p>'Oh no, ma'am, it were nice', came the soft reply, this bringing Vanessa to turn and face her so that the tips of their noses brushed.</p>
   <p>'But he assaulted you!' Vanessa said with total wonderment in her voice.</p>
   <p>'No, he didn't do that', said Mary simply, though really thinking how strange it was that an older lady should say such a thing, and half asking herself if it were all put on and had been arranged between the two. An even greater boldness of speech overcoming her, she added, 'I think he wanted to do it to you, really'.</p>
   <p>'Mary, you should not say such a thing', Vanessa murmured, quite unable to bring herself to believe that such a thought could have passed through the girl's mind.</p>
   <p>'Oh, I don't mean while I was watching', Mary said, as though that were a simple enough explanation.</p>
   <p>'Really, Mary, it is unthinkable-unthinkable'. Vanessa's voice was blurred and she allowed the girl to cuddle closer into her, Mary bringing up her knee so that it rested roundly under her Mistress's pulsing slit.</p>
   <p>'No, it ain't', Mary wanted to say, but thought better of it and stayed quiet as both began drifting into sleep.</p>
   <p>At least she knew now why her Mistress had called out for her downstairs earlier.</p>

    <p>Chapter Four</p>
   </title>
   <p>All the next morning Vanessa was restless and had stayed in bed until she heard her brother's departure. Upon Mary bringing up her tea, she could hardly bring her eyes to meet the girl's and pretended at first to be dozing until the maid gently shook her shoulder and said, 'Tea's nice and hot, ma'am, and the toast is as you like it'.</p>
   <p>Perhaps Vanessa asked herself whether one could return to normality after such events, and yet she knew that she must bring herself to and so sat up and made much of fussing with her hair while keeping her face down, and Mary patiently waiting all the time with the tray.</p>
   <p>'I shall be going out today, Mary', Vanessa mumbled.</p>
   <p>'But the Vicar's coming, ma'am, ain't he? I won't know what to say to him if I'm on my own'.</p>
   <p>'Oh, that's this afternoon and I may still be out', Vanessa answered impatiently.</p>
   <p>Mary then served her Mistress and drifted to the door where she hesitated. The events of the night were as rich in her mind as they were in Vanessa's, and she had enjoyed them. Moreover, she had several times felt the tawse under one of the pillows during all the amourous embraces and had begun to put two and two together.</p>
   <p>'It'll be all right, m'am, really it will', Mary said simply and was then already gone and pretending not to hear when Vanessa called after her, 'What do you mean, Mary?'</p>
   <p>Indeed, her maid's pert remark seemed so outrageous to Vanessa that she was minded to confront the girl with it again, but being aware that they had passed through several previously unthinkable barriers together she held her tongue and at eleven went out riding, much to the dismay of Mary who did not then know whether or not she would be back in time for her appointment with the reverend gentleman of whom she had heard several naughty things from other girls in the village. The word tawse was not quite as new to her as it had been to Vanessa and Reggie and Mary knew well enough that many a girl had had her bottom stung before she became willing.</p>
   <p>Mary herself had become 'willing' all of a year before, though having been spanked first and not strapped-and certainly not by the Vicar-but that itself is another tale which may be later told. For the nonce we must return to Vanessa who rode aimlessly about the countryside and was several times much admired by passing gentlemen and several yokels, one of whom she blushingly heard say to his companion, 'That there one's got a lovely bum, Bill'.</p>
   <p>Becoming thristy, Vanessa knew she must return, for it was unthinkable for a lady to enter a hostelry alone, and hence she made her way back, now and then pausing her steed and wishing that the ground might swallow her up- wishing indeed that she and Reggie (of whom she had begun to think with curled lip) had never taken up this rural abode.</p>
   <p>Mary meanwhile had been drinking, which was most unusual for her, but she had become bored and had just finished her second glass of sherry when her Mistress finally appeared, immediately sniffing the air as the maid entered the hall from the kitchen to meet her.</p>
   <p>'Mary, you have been drinking!' Vanessa exclaimed.</p>
   <p>'Ma'am, I didn't mean to and you can take it out of my wages if you want', Mary said in such a woebegone fashion that Vanessa's heart immediately softened.</p>
   <p>'Well, you shouldn't at your age, should you?' she asked, whereupon Mary took on a pout.</p>
   <p>'Don't do no harm if you enjoy things, does it? If you wants me to come in with you again tonight I will', she added, running the two thoughts together.</p>
   <p>'Really, Mary, we must not be… well…', Vanessa ended rather lamely and attempted to hide such confusion as she felt by removing her riding hat-a tricorne of blue velvet with a little feather-and her gloves which normally Mary would have taken from her but instead Mary stood holding her hands together and regarding the carpet.</p>
   <p>'I s'pose-s'pose you want me to leave now, ma'am, is that it?' she asked woefully.</p>
   <p>'No, of course I do not, you silly', flustered Vanessa who in all these new situations was at a greater loss for words than she had ever been in her life. The sensation-curious as it was to her-that she wanted to kiss and be kissed by the girl came over her again so that both stood mute and each as if waiting on the other.</p>
   <p>'Well, if you don't want me ever to come in with you again', Mary said with downcast face still, and so much so that Vanessa's heart leapt. Without further thought she gathered the younger and smaller girl to her.</p>
   <p>'But you said it was nice', she uttered impulsively and, although she could have bitten her tongue off, knew the words to be true for herself.</p>
   <p>Slowly then Mary's face lifted.-'Was', she said, her lips pouting forward in forming the word.</p>
   <p>'But my brother…', Vanessa then wished to say. Instead, and with no conscious movement on her part whatever, she found her lips touching Mary's. For an infinitesimal moment in time she thought to retract the caress, but so tender was the meeting of their soft, moist lips that a new ague of desire seized Vanessa even more than it did Mary, who found that same long tongue that she had enjoyed the night before now oozing into her mouth again.</p>
   <p>A dizziness seized Vanessa then. Her kisses with males had been relatively infrequent and in some part forced when she was young. The meeting of her mouth with that of another young female, the slow twirling of tongues and the feeling of her tits bulging against another's filled her suddenly with an almost insensible desire. Passing her hands downwards, she began to caress Mary's tight young bottom, remembering vividly how the girl had felt and invaded her own. Her head hanging back, and the faint cloud of sherry emanating from her mouth quite intoxicating Vanessa, Mary moved her hips gently and encouragingly as-remaining</p>
   <p>interlocked-her Mistress began to gather up the back of Mary's dress.</p>
   <p>It was in that vital and passionate moment in Vanessa's life that a footfall was heard, whereupon Vanessa frantically recalled having left the front door unlatched.</p>
   <p>'Are we at home?' came the booming voice of he whose visit she half feared.</p>
   <p>Staggering apart and flushed of face, the two females stood frozen for a moment until Vanessa weakly answered, 'Yes, I am here', and thereupon giving Mary a little push which sent her towards the door of the drawing room wherein they stood.</p>
   <p>'Excellent, excellent! I may enter?' was the rejoinder, the Vicar thereupon bumping into a flurried and excited Mary, and his eyes missing nothing of the look of disarray she had about her, to say nothing of the fact that the back of her skirt was hitched up revealingly to the backs of her knees.</p>
   <p>Nor could he have missed the expression on Vanessa's face as he strode in upon her. Her lips were moist, he saw, and she had the pleasing look of a woman who has been indulging in something other than innocent activity.</p>
   <p>'I believe we have to talk, my dear', he uttered, and in such tones that Vanessa guiltily suspected him of being able to see through walls.</p>
   <p>'I d… did not expect you so soon', she stammered under his avuncular gaze.</p>
   <p>'But even so you expected, did you not?'</p>
   <p>'I'll make tea, ma'am, shall I?' came Mary's slightly frantic call from along the hall-she remaining cautiously out of sight.</p>
   <p>It was Vanessa who should have replied, but the Vicar who did so, saying, 'No, not yet, for your Mistress and I will be conversing. Upstairs, I do believe', he added, taking the unresisting hand of Vanessa.</p>
   <p>'I d… do not wish…', stammered she.</p>
   <p>'Our wishes do not always come true. Some of the pleasant ones do so, though, Miss Markham', rejoined her visitor who to her relief kept his voice lowered upon those words. 'Come, Miss Markham, I have promised to attend upon you, have I not, and it shall not be said of me that I ever failed my word'.</p>
   <p>The single, feeble 'But…' that fell then from Vanessa's lips being utterly ignored, she found herself being led up by the hand much as a child is taken to the dentist, and so indeed she felt. The closer that the bedroom, came, the more her tummy swirled with butterflies.</p>
   <p>'It is as well if we are quiet, for your maid will otherwise hear. Do you have something to tell me? Did you have a good night? I trust you did. Remove your dress and drawers, please', the Vicar said in one flowing mode while closing the door and leaning against it.</p>
   <p>'R… r… remove?' stammered Vanessa.</p>
   <p>'And then bend over. I will instruct you in your stance since it is evidently new to you. Where is the… ah, yes, here beneath your pillow as I wished it to be. Obedience becomes you, Miss Markham. Now, hurry please, or I shall be forced to effect the removal of your attire myself and such further protestations as you would undoubtedly make would inevitably attract the attention of your attractive young domestic. Quite pretty, is she not? May I assist in unbuttoning the back of your dress. You have fine legs, you know. What a sin it is to hide them!'</p>
   <p>'Oh God!' moaned Vanessa irreverently, causing him to frown and shake his head as he approached her slowly, she backing away until her bottom bumped against the front of her dressing table.</p>
   <p>'Swiftly and surely, my dear, it is always the best way, and then we will see to you, eh?'</p>
   <p>'No, no, I beg you no; it is a sin', Vanessa whimpered as quietly as she could, though spun about in the process and her buttons already being unshecked one by one until her dress fell away at the top and both could see the milky looming of her breasts above the neckline of her petticoat. Swaying, Vanessa felt herself being stripped slowly, even to the removal of her sheer undergarment and-to her seemingly undying shame-the gentle lowering of her drawers out of which he forced her to step before turning her about to face him, whereat Vanessa defensively crossed her forearms over her titties.</p>
   <p>'There is no haste, you know', the Vicar said gently, 'No haste at all. In due course you will take pleasure in being unveiled thus for you have magnificent tits, a fine arse and superb legs. As for your cunny-let me see it properly, woman-open your legs!'</p>
   <p>'Aahh!' came then from Vanessa, for in speaking he slapped first one thigh and then the other, bringing a flare of pink up to the surface of the creamy flesh that she felt such shame to surrender to his eyes. Her fine long legs shifting mutinously but an inch apart, her thighs then received another and much sharper smack which caused her to choke down a squeal of dismay and edge her feet outwards yet another inch. Her proud titties wobbled, their tips already a little fiery with unbidden desire as the Vicar well saw, though their arousal had been rather from her embrace with Mary than from the exposure to which she now was put, attired only in her shoes and gartered stockings.</p>
   <p>As his fingers passed gently about her, so Vanessa bit her lower lip, flushing much and staring past him into space. First he lifted each of her breasts, savouring its weight and resilience and passing his thumb several times across each nipple until it had erected itself fully and stuck out like a proud brown cone.</p>
   <p>With an insensate quiver, though remaining cautiously still as possible while ever under the rim of her gaze she could see the waiting tawse lying lax upon the bed, she felt his hands glide around her hips. The heel of his right hand then brushed her bush, making her jerk, but at that he placed the left one against the back of her neck and slipped seeking fingers under her plump, hairy slit.</p>
   <p>'You will come on heat a little even before I strap this magnificent arse of yours. It is as well you should', the Vicar murmured thickly. Finding the rolled lips beneath her Venus mount, he parted them, felt the nub of Vanessa's clitoris and the emergent oiliness that he most sought in an unclothed female.</p>
   <p>'Please, no!' Vanessa whimpered, though rather to herself, as it seemed, than to him.</p>
   <p>'A dozen good strokes to start you off, my dear, and then we shall see. Obedience well becomes a young woman of your stature and figure, as you will surely come to understand'.</p>
   <p>His fingers worked still, slowly but surely, bringing a choked-back moan from her that told him well her condition, for such fragrant moisture as normally exuded from her cunt on having it caressed had now begun to increase, and a distinct grinding of her teeth was heard.</p>
   <p>'Come… bend… bend… legs apart'.</p>
   <p>Vanessa heard the scattered words, though not those in-between-rather as one hears fragments of conversation through a door. Her legs were tottering and her cunnylips were already ridged with desire as the bed seemed to come to her rather than she to it. Hands guided her and her hands flopped forward to support herself. And had she known- could she but have known-what she was to learn from this bizarre event, Vanessa might well have offered a better posture than she did: 'Your legs straight and apart, your bottom out-thrust and your back dipped, Miss Markham', the Vicar had need several times to instruct her.</p>
   <p>'How-wer!' Vanessa gasped as the first stroke of the leather came, coursing fierily across her lustrous bumcheeks and causing her hips to roll so voluptuously that the Vicar deftly and quickly unbuttoned his trouser flap and-unseen by her-brought his monstrous tool to light and to a state of perfect readiness.</p>
   <p>'Bottom-out!' he repeated, underlining the words with a second searing sweep that caused Vanessa's head to jerk up and then fall again while a shrill cry broke from her and was immediately and shamefully muffled by the pressing of her flushed face into the bedcover.</p>
   <p>'It is as well to be as quiet as you can, Miss Markham. Bedrooms are a place of discipline, training and-yes, my dear-sperming. legs! Legs apart now or I shall afford you many more than I intended to. Have you not sinned? Have you not?' cra-aaaaack!</p>
   <p>'Wah-haaaar! Yeh-esss!' Vanessa sobbed as her derriere, plump and rich as it was and ennobled by the deep furrow between the ardent cheeks, was again invaded by seeking flames. Hissing through her nose as she endeavoured to contain the fiery tongues that seeped through her glorious globe and sought her every crevice, Vanessa cupped her face in her hands, feeling the thickly-sprouting hairs of her love-pouch brushing against the edge of the quilt with every succeeding stroke that caused her hips to jerk.</p>
   <p>'No! I can't, I can't!' she blubbered wildly, though in answer to nothing.</p>
   <p>'But you have, Miss Markham, and shall again', opined the Vicar, causing the tawse to slap-smack smartly into her burning orb, for though nothing explicit had been stated in that brief exchange, he knew well enough what Vanessa meant and knew, too, that <emphasis>she </emphasis>knew, even though the precise words would have then been beyond the range of modest expression for her.</p>
   <p>'Yow-wer! Doh-on't!' came piteously and pleadingly from her, fingertips pressed against her forehead as the relentless leather again took its toll of her hitherto almost unstriped bottom.</p>
   <p>'You will say YES, Miss Markham-yes! — for that is what I wish to hear from you. Let me hear you say it now, girl!'</p>
   <p>'Cah-ha-an't-I can't-I mustn't! yee-eee-eeek! Oh, please no, I can't bear it!'</p>
   <p>'You will indeed be saying that, my dear, if I continue this much longer, and that I intend to do'. sra-aaaack! cra-aaaack! SPLATT!</p>
   <p>By then, as might well be imagined, Vanessa's bottom had assumed a hue of deep pink-verging indeed towards red. But her piteous sobs, her wails, her beseeching cries were utterly unavailing in that moment, as she was to learn. Twice she had been urged-almost by Mary as much as by her own sudden desires-to push through one barrier, and now the lewd cleric was pressing her to break another. Stubborn as Vanessa was and always had been when the Priapus threatened her, she tried now to continue to be,</p>
   <p>tears pearling down her cheeks, and grimacing into her cupped hands while her hips rotated and swirled to the implacable urging of the tawse and the invasive heat it produced in her bottom and loins.</p>
   <p>Accustomed as he was to such, the Vicar waited with rearing and exposed prick for that breaking point which he knew must come. The tawse swept slowly-once, twice, thrice more, imposing its sharp slap-smacking authority into Vanessa's rich buttocks until at last came her pleading, sobbing, half-shamed and yet equally half-excited cry of 'Yes!'</p>

    <p>Chapter Five</p>
   </title>
   <p>Upon the fading of her cry there came to Vanessa's ears two sounds. The first was that of the tawse flopping to the carpet. The other was the equally unmistakable one of the Vicar thrusting down his trousers.</p>
   <p>'No, please, don't', came her whimper thereupon, but that was as equally expected by the Vicar as was her surrender. In such circumstances the lecherous gentleman knew that there could be no sensuous preliminaries other than those he had afforded her and that the smooth effecting of his immediate desires was imperative.</p>
   <p>'Legs-bottom', he uttered tonelessly just as he had done before and therewith clamped Vanessa's hips firmly on either side with his broad hands and nubbed the glowing crest of his charger up beneath the seared orb of her bottom to brush against the curls and the rolled lips of her quim.</p>
   <p>A choking sound escaped Vanessa at that first contact and her hips would have proved evasive had he not held them still. The bulb of his cock feeling so swollen and warm, an eagerness for it seized her as much as did a sense of apprehension.</p>
   <p>'Be still, girl! Hold your bottom up!' growled the Vicar who took an insensate pleasure in ploughing a female for the first time when her bottom felt nigh-bursting with heat.</p>
   <p>'Whoooo!' came then Vanessa's moan, for with that the ruddy, purple-headed shaft commenced sleeking a path between the clinging walls of her nest, probing within inch by inch and-as it gained entry-causing Vanessa to wriggle madly against the steadying of his strong hands, albeit in vain. Having sheathed four inches of his throbbing prick and finding her love cavern juicy and receptive, the Vicar had no difficulty in stirring his pestle while he now leaned his weight more over her back and transferred his grasp from the superbly-curved hips to the pendant gourds of her tits whose hardened nipples bespoke well for Vanessa's otherwise hidden state of excitement.</p>
   <p>Torrid words of desire flooded the mind of the Vicar in those moments of sensual ecstasy. Uttering a few uncontrollable groans, he tensed himself for a moment that was as self-teasing as it was satisfying for both, and then with a grunt sheathed his stiff pego to the full within Vanessa's lusciously-enfolding sheath.</p>
   <p>Even so, the Reverend Percival Jubstone knew better than to be too crudely expressive in speech in the first fucking of a young woman, or indeed an even younger girl, after attending to her bottom. Erotic discipline, as he understood it, was best applied in commanding silence which the female would do well to learn when she was being mastered as Vanessa then was.</p>
   <p>Nor did Vanessa thereafter struggle. Such squirmings of her seared bottom as made of it a hot ball of flesh into his belly offered signs of oncoming pleasure rather than resistance. Her head still being bowed and her face hidden, the Vicar then continued caressing her brown stiff nipples with one hand while passing the other tightly under her chin and forcing her to look up bleary-eyed at the flowered paper on her bedroom wall while his pulsing cock began easing a passage back and forth in her quim.</p>
   <p>The Vicar prided himself on the fact that he never forgot the essentials of a disciplinary posture for a young woman whose bottom has been surrendered to the fire of birch or strap or cane. The posture of the supplicant must be correct and, if necessary, she must be correctly held. Above all, the face must not be buried in seeming dire shame or embarrassment but must be made to face forward, mouth open as it often was in expressive wonder of mingling surprise and desire.</p>
   <p>As for Vanessa herself, the fires of lust had already begun to blaze in her despite her previous uncertainties and apprehensions. Hissing through her finely-curved nostrils, she felt herself spraying deliriously as the implacable shunting back and forth of the Vicar's cock took its lubricious toll of her, yet she retained her silence for a different reason from the Vicar, which is to say from a reason of pride.</p>
   <p>Feeling the additional lubrication that her emissions produced, the Vicar grimaced pleasurably, causing her hot bottom to smack hard against him again and again as he worked his sturdy shaft whose veins Vanessa could feel pulsing within her clenching maw. Both breathed heavily, and although the small, rebellious movements of her face had at first been fretful against the gliding of his hand beneath her proud chin, Vanessa made no real attempt to dip her head.</p>
   <p>She received, she accepted, feeling a sense of awe and excitement in his lewd authority over her, and even occasionally-and as if secretively-pressing her sparkling bum-cheeks into him. Mewing faintly, she entered a second and a third whirlpool of orgasmic pleasure, creaming the bedcover beneath her and even delirously sprinkling the Vicar's balls as they swung beneath her avid cunny.</p>
   <p>Feeling this, his own grunts of pleasure increased, though still he contained himself in approving silence. Ceasing to caress her swollen titties, he passed his free hand around the fronts of her full thighs, uttered a low moan of animal-like pleasure, embedded himself to the root and loosed the long thick shots of his curdling sperm into Vanessa's blissfully-squeezing slit.</p>
   <p>'Mmmmmmm!' Vanessa whimpered, though allowing no other sound to pass her lips as she felt the powerful shoots bubbling and coursing within her receptive maw. Threshing his powerful penis then, the Vicar pumped her vigourously, releasing all the pent-up energy in his balls until the last thick pearls dripped out within.</p>
   <p>Thereat he steadied both Vanessa and himself, retaining the weighty plumpness of her bottom into him until he was satisfied that all was done, and his long thick cock then slowly withdrew, hesitating at the ridged lips for a moment until the glistening knob slipped therefrom and he uttered simply, 'Into bed, Miss Markham, please!'</p>
   <p>Wriggling sinuously in an effort both to obey him and to cover herself-swimmy as she felt-Vanessa showed her creamed cunt fully to him in scrabbling beneath the clothes in the manner of a child who hides beneath the sheet arid blankets in the dark. Indeed, only the top of her huddled head remained visible as the Vicar slowly adjusted his dress and buttoned his trousers up anew.</p>
   <p>'You will stay so. I shall attend upon you again', he murmured. He paused as if to say something else, but then changed his mind. No sound coming from the huddled hidden figure, he nodded to himself in satisfaction and made his way downstairs where the wondering figure of Mary quickly appeared.</p>
   <p>'You are on no account to disturb your Mistress, my girl, for she does not wish it'.</p>
   <p>'No, sir, I understand, sir, but when the master comes home, what do I say then to him, sir?' asked the maid who thus folded one unspoken question within another, as the wily Vicar well perceived.</p>
   <p>'Why, Mary, you may say simply that she is abed, my dear. I do not recall, by the way, having seen you in my congregation. I trust that I shall have the pleasure of that very soon'.</p>
   <p>'Well, sir-yes, sir, but I can't read so well and I don't know the words of the hymns and…'</p>
   <p>'Tut-tut, girl, can you imagine that I would fail to teach you such myself?' the Vicar asked, tipping up her chin with his finger as he was often wont to do and thus holding the girl's attention in every way.</p>
   <p>'Well, if you says, sir', replied Mary whose desire to go to church was scarcely pressing.</p>
   <p>'Come to the Vicarage one evening next week. I will so arrange matters with your Mistress, that you might be free. There will I teach you that which you surely wish to know', came the grave answer, though Mary herself saw more in it than he thought and gave a little silent sniff behind his retreating back as if to say, 'I'm not sure if I will'. For she was in no doubt that he was a clever old devil in many respects, and not least perhaps concerning Vanessa. But as to that, Mary decided to keep a cautious silence towards</p>
   <p>her Mistress, for the time being at least. It was not her business what the gentry did, she thought-unless she could do it with them.</p>
   <p>The complete silence from upstairs spoke volumes to Mary, even though it comforted Vanessa who was experiencing still so many sensations and chasing so many thoughts that she was like one who with a single net would simultaneously catch a dozen butterflies.</p>
   <p>The burning of her bottom, the shamefulness of her undressing, the emergence of his cock in her furry dell- all showered upon her at once as did the memories of the preceding night and of her tentative and renewed embrace with Mary downstairs. Oh, how sweet it was to kiss and caress a girl, Vanessa told herself, though frequently in her huddled darkness found herself peeking out from behind the thought to imagine the Vicar's cock and how it must have looked. Wicked, awful, horrid, wonderful-and the feeling of it ploughing her quim was like no experience she had ever known before. Yet she had felt the same upon lying with Mary, and that was equally nice. Oh, how bewildering, and what sort of woman had she suddenly become? I want to give in-I do not want to give in, Vanessa's thoughts went torturously, yet now and again she would move her hips petulantly underneath the bedclothes as if she wanted more-as if she wanted more, while downstairs Mary sneaked back to the sherry flask and, after a couple more generous glasses, began to feel nice and blurry.</p>
   <p>Which indeed was how Reggie found the girl on his return. He had forgotten his key and rang twice in vain before stomping around to the back of the house and letting himself in by a rear door, where in the kitchen he found the maid lolling on a chair, her legs apart, skirt raised, and her fingers cosily between her thighs where she had been dreamily toying with her slit.</p>
   <p>'Oh-wer, sir!' she blurted at her Master's entrance, made to spring up and then collapsed down again onto her seat, causing Reggie to regard her with surprise.</p>
   <p>'Mary, have you been drinking?' he asked rather unnecessarily, for the evidence of the almost empty flask, and the glass on the table before her was clear enough, as were the cloudy fumes that came from her lips.</p>
   <p>'Haven't, no', Mary mumbled, then giggled and hiccuped and thrust her dress between her black-stockinged legs.</p>
   <p>'I will see to you later, Mary', Reggie announced briskly, and this to cover his own confusion for the girl was damned attractive and he had been up her already, but there was the presence of his sister to consider.</p>
   <p>Striding past the maid, he started to enter the hall when Mary seemingly awoke again out of her semi-daze and said with another hiccup and a giggle, 'The Vicar come, sir, and Mistress is in bed'.</p>
   <p>'Ah', said Reggie and-very much as the Vicar himself had made his exit from upstairs-it seemed that he might say more than that, but held his tongue and closed the door firmly upon the girl.</p>
   <p>Given that the Vicar had been, Reggie pondered momentarily as he ascended-and given that he might well have carried out his word… The idea hastened his footsteps and brought him rapidly to Vanessa's door which he opened without knocking, perceiving immediately the crouched form of his sister and even more of her attire upon the floor than there had been the day before.</p>
   <p>'Mary?' came a faint voice from beneath the sheet</p>
   <p>'No, my dear, it is I'.</p>
   <p>'Oh, Reggie, pray go away!' came Vanessa's timid bleat</p>
   <p>'No, my dear', Reggie responded firmly. The shadow, if not the very figure, of the Vicar seemed to loom at his back, waiting upon his next action, though Reggie had no doubt as to what it must be. Drawers there, a dress here, a petticoat cast down upon it… Goodness, Vanessa must be near naked if not completely so!</p>
   <p>'WAH!' was the next sound that came from the bed, emanating from Vanessa's lips as in one bound Reggie was upon the bed and sweeping the coverings down to her ankles.-'Reggie! Don't look! Oh no! AH!'</p>
   <p>'You beauty, you devil, you have been naughty, have you not?' her brother demanded, viewing at last the rounded perfection of her still faintly-reddened bottom, the noble bulbing of her brown-nippled tits, and the well-tufted glory of her Venus mount.</p>
   <p>'You mustn't look at mee-heee!', Vanessa cried, but then uttered a 'GLUP!' as his mouth crushed down upon her velvet lips while her naked torso twisted this way and that in vain attempts to defy the seeking of his fingers everywhere.-'NOO-NOO-NOOO!' blubbered Vanessa several muffled times under the passion of his kisses, but the sensation of a palm brushing her rubbery nipples and then forcing itself under her plump, sticky quim were finally too much for the young woman who to her bewilderment found herself letting her tongue lap her brother's while her would-be mutinous thighs were eased slowly apart.</p>
   <p>'My love-how long have I wanted this!' Reggie choked emotionally as he sought at the same time to release his rampant pego.</p>
   <p>'Don't say-mustn't say-oh, Reggie, your hands…'</p>
   <p>Yet her voice was weakening-slurring even-and she was murmuring even as the tip of her tongue brushed his; even indeed as his thrumming prick came against her thigh, causing her to utter a breathless, pleading and yet helpless 'No!'.</p>
   <p>'Yes, my pet, it is I who am going to plough your cunt now-now that you have been tawsed', growled Reggie lustfully, manoeuvering himself upon her until his weight pinned her feebly-protesting form beneath his own.</p>
   <p>'Re-geeeee!' squealed Vanessa, for with far less restraint than the Vicar had shown, the ruddy helmet of his stiff penis had already oozed between the pouting, wet lips and drove upwards within the silky-warm haven-and that cry, that one piercing cry, did reach the ears of Mary who started up in such immediate awareness of what must be passing as comes to all in some moments.</p>
   <p>'Coming, ma'am!' Mary called back hazily, though not so loudly that either of the occupants of the bed could hear her. Nor in the wild and violent threshing of their locked bodies were they aware of Mary's ascent, the maid haphazardly casting off her cap and apron en route.</p>
   <p>Snuffling, choking, kissing sounds came to Mary even before she reached the door which Reggie in his haste had left ajar. Being the first to glimpse her entering figure, Va-nessa flung up one arm which she did not ever remember casting around her brother's neck and held it out, saying with seeming desperation, 'Oh, Mary, oh!' while the maid's vision drank in the sight of Reggie's all-too-fiercely-working buttocks and those of Vanessa wriggling in turn to his thrusts.</p>
   <p>'Oh, ma'am!' choked Mary, albeit that it was not a cry of accusation but rather one of admiration. Uncaring as to what might ensue from her actions, she cast herself down beside the heaving pair and circled her own arms about Vanessa's neck, kissing her upon the cheek and saying excitedly, 'It's nice, it's nice!'</p>
   <p>'Mur-mur-mur!' blurted Reggie, trying to utter the maid's name, but being already so close to the point of ejaculating his sperm that all his other senses appeared to be leaving him. Moreover, after one glance at the shunting of his piston just beneath the furred hump of her Mistress's mount, Mary gave all the attention of her eyes and mouth to those of Vanessa.</p>
   <p>'Stop him! Oh, Mary, he's… he's… he's going to come in me!' sobbed Vanessa in a desperation of desire and bewilderment that such things could not only be done but seen.</p>
   <p>'Oh no, ma'am, it's nice, it's nice. Go on, let him do it', Mary chanted, kissing the very lips that had spoken the words and having such a boldness upon her that she eased her hand between them and fondled Vanessa's love-stung nipples.</p>
   <p>'Doo-Doooh! Do-ing it!' Reggie managed to gasp then and leaned up, supported on his forearms while Vanessa, despite all her protests, squeezed his yearning prick in her nest and felt the first vibrant shoots from her second cock of the afternoon, albeit moaning 'No, no, no!' 'into Mary's mouth while the maid's hand stroked her cheek.</p>
   <p>'Lovely, it's lovely, ma'am', cooed Mary.</p>
   <p>'Haaaar!' Vanessa gasped.</p>
   <p>She was emitting her own pearly spurts then and sucking in her brother's globbing sperm at the same time-and it was too late, too late, too late to ever stop.</p>

   </title>
   <p>In the aftermath that followed, Reggie knew not how to comport himself in the presence of Mary who continued lying as if protectively beside her Mistress. The damned girl-the darling girl-he thought simultaneously, for in truth he desired to fuck them both together, or as best as he was able, but considering their different stations in life (and this despite his rashness of the night before) it seemed to him a deuced difficult thing to do.</p>
   <p>Hence he rolled over on his back and lay with one arm across his eyes, as though the light hurt them. A huge sigh- though whether of satisfaction or despair he could not tell- came from Vanessa who rose from the bed and said as stiffly as she might, 'Help me to dress, Mary'.</p>
   <p>Reggie peeped from under his arm in the process and liked what he saw, and in particular the display that Vanessa offered him as she raised first one leg and then the other to get her feet into her drawers. There was dried sperm on her bush, he observed with satisfaction, and then rolled over to lie upon his face while the two left him on the much-tousled bed.</p>
   <p>'All men is the same, ma'am', Mary opined when she and Vanessa had made themselves a cup of tea downstairs. 'They all does it to you and then they gets tired, or at least some of them do', she added philosophically.</p>
   <p>'But that my own brother should have done such a thing', Vanessa murmured emptily, though not without such a trace of hypocrisy in her tone as brought her maid to grin at her cheekily.</p>
   <p>'Like I said, ma'am, it don't matter who, if it's nice, it really don't'</p>
   <p>'It should', Vanessa uttered gloomily, albeit that she was beginning to believe that less and less.</p>
   <p>Sitting informally as they were at the kitchen table, Mary edged her chair closer to her Mistress's.</p>
   <p>'Of course, if you really didn't want to do it with him ever, Miss, and he knew it, then of course he were bad- well, naughty anyway'.</p>
   <p>'He was-bad, I mean. Really, Mary, I don't think we ought to discuss it anymore. I shall keep my bedroom door locked permanently henceforth, for there is no way of dealing with such a horrid matter. Why, if it were to be found out, what a scandal there would be', exclaimed Vanessa who despite her chumminess with Mary found it hard to conceive that the maid could not only have watched her incestuous bout with Reggie but actually encouraged her, though even on that her mind was split, for all three now were unduly aroused.</p>
   <p>'My lady at my last house, Miss-the first one I was at before I came to you-she always said never to worry what people say about you, and I think that's right'.</p>
   <p>'She said it to you'? Vanessa asked in surprise.</p>
   <p>'Well, you see there was an-what did she call it-oh, yes, an occurrence, which was a funny word, I thought. You see, the Master there he misbehaved himself something proper and was caught out at it by her. So she and her sister what had come to stay, well-they saw to him'.</p>
   <p>'Saw to…? Go on, Mary. What? Whatever did they do?'</p>
   <p>There then began much whispering during which Vanessa had cause to gape and her head to spin even more, though she could not imagine that young Mary could have such an inventive mind as to make such events up.</p>
   <p>'Mary, break open another bottle of sherry!'</p>
   <p>Such were Vanessa's quick-breathing words when the maid had concluded her recital, for what she had heard had raised her to an almost equal state of excitement as that which had passed during the last two days, and which she was now the more ready to admit had been such. Elaborating between themselves on the revelations of Mary's tale, the two drank, kissed, passed their hands up beneath the other's skirt and brought themselves to a rare state even while Reggie was arousing himself and dousing his face with water in the bathroom.</p>
   <p>Hearing his movements, and with the two rubbing their fingers lubriciously around each other's cunny, Mary giggled and said, 'There ain't no time like the present, ma'am. if you feels like it'.</p>
   <p>'I do, Mary! Fetch the spare washing line, for that will do us a treat'.</p>
   <p>Mysterious as these words would have sounded to an innocent bystander, they were to prove otherwise when Reggie finally descended, wondering indeed what his reception was going to be. It was jolly quiet and he could not hear Mary moving about as usual, nor was there any sight of his sister in the drawing room or dining room. Vanessa, he thought rather gloomily, must have gone out, but it was upon that cogitation that her voice called to him from the kitchen.</p>
   <p>'We are in here, Reggie!'</p>
   <p>Was it an invitation? The plural indicated such-but what an odd place for them to be! The old linoleum sounded under his feet as he advanced thereto and, upon his doing so, a silence again held which he conceived to be odd or promising, or both. Then-even as he made to turn the handle-the door was opened by Mary who, saying nothing, stepped aside to let him enter upon the stone-flagged floor.</p>
   <p>The kitchen had been much tidied since Reggie had passed through it an hour before. The large deal table stood empty and solid and all but one wooden chair had been tucked neatly beneath it. The lone companion thereof stood a little away from the table with its seat turned towards it.</p>
   <p>The door closed. Mary leaned against it behind him, which Reggie conceived to be curious and indeed slightly unnerving. Hands on her hips, Vanessa stood with her corsage unbuttoned and her full-blown breasts blatantly on view.</p>
   <p>'Dear Reggie, we are both ready for you again, but we wish to play a little game first. Come, dear, for it will be fun. Seat yourself on the chair and Mary will raise her skirts first', Vanessa coolly announced while toying teasingly with her hard-pebbled nipples.</p>
   <p>'I say!' came Reggie's astonished response. For his sister to speak so boldly-and in front of their maid no less- indicated such a change in her that he felt he must have satisfied her more than he had thought. A great sense of warmth and renewed wickedness invaded him, which was encouraged by Mary who from behind him laced her arms about his waist and said, 'Yes, sir, do. Open your trousers and sit down and I will come on you first and then the Mistress will'.</p>
   <p>'Let me do it for him, Mary', Vanessa uttered and, while Reggie found himself being hugged more tightly by the maid, she advanced swiftly upon him and in no time at all had descended his trousers and under-drawers so that they heaped around his ankles, this causing Reggie to stumble as he was then drawn and pushed between the excited pair until his bare bottom met the hard seat of the kitchen chair, the squashing down of his balls causing his cock to begin to erect quickly.</p>
   <p>Vanessa, leaning over him, brought her hand to it and commenced rubbing it so excitedly that Reggie's eyes dimmed with passion. For a moment Vanessa permitted him to fondle her dangling titties, but then as if playfully she brushed his caressing digits away and murmured that she wished to pleasure him in her way for a change and that if he wished to be a really naughty boy with both of them he must be obedient and place his hands back behind the chair.</p>
   <p>'Wh… what?' stammered Reggie in his blurred excitement.</p>
   <p>'Because I want to play with your lovely big prick, darling, all by myself. Please?' wheedled an apparently thoroughly transformed Vanessa, and in such a cooing tone that Reggie obeyed, having no idea what Mary might be then doing, and not caring much either.</p>
   <p>It was in the next few seconds that Reggie was 'secured', and exactly as the two females had planned. One may say it briefly, for brevity and speed were the essence of such an operation as Mary understood it. Thus, as he obeyed, a waiting rope was thrown immediately over his head, brought down across his chest and then another loop repeated to his uttermost astonishment while Vanessa plumped herself across his lap with spread legs and raised skirt, pressing her bush to the base of his rampant pego, while Mary tied the ends of the rope by winding them first around the legs of the chair and then bringing them together in a knot.</p>
   <p>'I say, I say!' ejaculated Reggie who, upon the quick rising of his sister, had no means of getting up, save to carry the chair with him, though this also would have been impeded by the fact that Mary laid her weight upon the back of it.</p>
   <p>'You will say nothing, Reggie. You have been a bad wicked man. Gag him, Mary, please!'</p>
   <p>'GWAAAAH!' Reggie choked, but it was the last coherent sound he was allowed to utter as Mary looped a broad cloth around his mouth (she having gathered it out from within the neckline of her dress) and most effectively silenced him save for such snorts and muffled cries as he was about to utter.</p>
   <p>Both females were then able to step away and view him, all the while that Reggie's cheeks grew purple and his head shook violently.</p>
   <p>'There are times, my dear brother, when punishment precedes pleasure, and there are others when punishment follows pleasure. You have taken your toll of me and now it is time for retribution. Mary, please read him my statement of orders', Vanessa announced.</p>
   <p>'Yes, ma'am', Mary replied dutifully and then took out from a drawer in the table that which had been hastily penned between them. Standing before Reggie with her legs spread and a most perky but serious look on her face, she read out: 'Mr. Reginald Markham will henceforth obey the orders and the whims of Miss Vanessa Markham at all times and without question. He will be brought to produce his sperm twice daily during which times he will be held secure until he has brought himself to behave in a docile manner. In these instances he will be handled manually whether by Miss Markham or Miss Mary Smith. Should he additionally be accorded their favours-which will not otherwise be granted unless his obedience is total-he will be duly placed upon his back and will be so mounted. This state of affairs will continue until his future activities in lecherous behaviour are otherwise decided. Should he be required to do so, he will obtain young ladies for the favours of Miss Markham and will do so without question'.</p>
   <p>Reggie, having heard all this clearly, felt his head spin. His head shook again and his eyes strove to plead with those of Vanessa which glittered victoriously as she stood meanwhile with arms across her breasts.</p>
   <p>'Very well, he has heard and he has understood. If he has not fully comprehended, then that is no fault of mine. I would further tell you, Reggie, that any more misdemeanours on your part will be reported to the due authority, and that hence you have no recourse but to obey me. Very well, Mary, see to him, please, and then we will go down to the village.'</p>
   <p>'Yes, ma'am', replied Mary who was all a-quiver with excitement. Thereupon she produced from the dresser a large flannel and dressed it in nurse-like fashion around the stiff stem of Reggie's cock, asking impetuously, 'Now, ma'am?'</p>
   <p>'Of course. Did I not say so. Bring him off, Mary', replied Vanessa who had learned several useful phrases from the girl.</p>
   <p>At that-even though he might have been thought to have welcomed such-Reggie again shook his head wildly and bounced the chair, but all to no avail. Sniffing and pursing her lips as if the matter were really of little interest to her, and while Vanessa watched unmoving and implacably, the maid commenced rubbing the enfolding flannel up and down Reggie's rigid tool, causing his feet to jerk and his head to hang back.</p>
   <p>'Quickly, Reggie! I have little time enough to spare on you', Vanessa spat cruelly, this bringing more muffled groans from beneath the gag.</p>
   <p>'I think he's coming-on, ma'am, I can feel it throbbing more', Mary said.</p>
   <p>'Good. And when he does so, release your hand', Vanessa said upon a sudden inspiration of her own. for Reggie would then lose the enclosing warmth and comfort of her fingers through the cloth and would spill haplessly into it as it hung in cloaklike form over his charger.</p>
   <p>Which is indeed what happened, for-sensing at last the first emergent spout-Mary snatched her hand away, producing in Reggie the least satisfactory of sensations since the crest of the flannel merely hung down over his knob and hence deprived him of that clenching feeling that the male desires.</p>
   <p>'Come, dear', Vanessa said to Mary who had risen at the first thick soaking of Reggie's spermatic discharge. Leaving him to groan as the hapless spurts continued, the pair made their exit and closed the kitchen door upon their male prisoner or-as Mary whispered such were called-their cock-slave.</p>
   <p>'You were privy to much, Mary, at your last house', Vanessa said wondering as they prepared to go out, though the use of her third word caused Mary some initial astonishment since she knew only that a privy was a place where' one sat on a wooden seat with one's drawers down. Seeing her expression, Vanessa laughed and said, 'I mean, you were favoured with secrets by your Mistress there'.</p>
   <p>'Well, I helped you see-I gave a hand', Mary said truthfully enough. 'For she said as it would demean him more- her husband, I mean-if I were to do it. and she and her sister stood by and watched. That were the second time, though. The first time it was the sister what done it'.</p>
   <p>'So tell me again, Mary, what brought it all about', said Vanessa who was eager to absorb every detail and had a very quick ear indeed for such unusual words and phrases as Mary had been brought to learn on those occasions.</p>
   <p>'Well, ma'am, the girls used slates to write their lessons on and used to scratch away in their rooms, making those awful squeaking noises like chalk does, and it used to put my teeth on edge. Sometimes they rubbed them out and sometimes they didn't. There was sums on them sometimes, and words at other times. They was learning to spell, of course, though the older one-Victoria, she was-was the better at it. One day, being caught in a hurry, she left her slate in her room and her Mama saw what she had written on it. First she had written 'Nicest' and then underneath that she had turned the first two letters round and written 'Incest'. I didn't know what it meant at the time so I didn't know what the fuss was all about'.</p>
   <p>'Well, you do now, Mary', Vanessa said truthfully enough.</p>
   <p>Already then they were upon the path towards the village, and already by then, too, Vanessa had begun to recognise the deep transformation that had taken place within herself and which, with self-encouraging warmth, she accepted more and more.</p>
   <p>'Tell me again what you heard from Victoria's room several times before that', she encouraged.</p>
   <p>'Well, ma'am, as I said, there were times when the Mistress was out and some rare larks went on. At least, I thought they was from the sounds I heard. One afternoon…'</p>
   <p>But Mary's discourse was interrupted abruptly by the sound of hooves behind them, approaching rapidly, and when Vanessa turned her head it was to the see Reverend Jubstone reining in his horse and gazing benevolently down upon the pair.</p>
   <p>'We are well met again', he announced, giving Vanessa the boldest of looks.</p>
   <p>'Are we, sir?' she replied in a tone of voice that set him back.</p>
   <p>'I will attend upon you tomorrow, Miss Markham', he began, recovering his boisterousness and preparing then to ride forward again when her voice stayed him.</p>
   <p>'You will not, sir', Vanessa called, causing him to glance back at her in surprise.</p>
   <p>'I beg your pardon, Miss Markham? Did I hear correctly?'</p>
   <p>'If your hearing is not affected by your riding, then I judge that you did. If I wish to receive you I will send word. Otherwise I will not be at home to you. Pray do not let me delay you any longer for I am sure duties must be many'.</p>
   <p>'Eh? Ah, yes!' came the choked and somewhat angry response which caused Vanessa's expression to change not at all. For a moment he frowned, then uttered politely but coldly, 'It is as you wish'.</p>
   <p>'Indeed it is', Vanessa called as he rode off, this producing a giggle from Mary who furtively clasped her Mistress's hands for a moment, saying, 'That were telling him, ma'am. The dirty old devil', she added bitingly.</p>
   <p>'They all are, dear, just as you said', was Vanessa's cool reply. For the first time in her life she felt fully in command of herself and was glorifying in it.</p>

    <p>Chapter Seven</p>
   </title>
   <p>Since the death of his wife, Eric Partridge had taken into his household her also bereaved sister, Margaret, who was a shade younger than himself and with whom he lived in a state of complete propriety which-though little did he know it-sometimes amused the lady and sometimes irked her, for she saw it as no flattery to herself that he did not even unbend to kiss her goodnight.</p>
   <p>No outstanding beauty, Margaret was even so a woman of considerable attractions which the male eye could normally not fail to espy. Her breasts were large, her hips sumptuous and her legs of goodly proportions. Her noble bottom she bore proudly, for it had taken its toll of several male pricks during her thirty-nine years, but during that past twelve months had felt so deprived of spermaceous injections that a feeling of desperation had overtaken her.</p>
   <p>Not unnaturally, the household was often fully occupied, for Mr. Partridge had two young sons of his own — Freddy, who was fifteen, and George, some eighteen months his senior-as well as two daughters, Alice and Mabel. The latter was a twin to Freddie while Mabel had recently attained her nineteenth year.</p>
   <p>Margaret's brood was smaller and consisted of one son, Bertie and another whom she had named Hugh, after his father. Their ages being sixteen and eighteen respectively, they were growing lads and sometimes evinced the fact by such roguish playfulness with their stepsisters as Margaret could not fail to notice with a yearning sigh that such days seemed to have passed for her.</p>
   <p>A sense of relief would sweep through Margaret whenever her brother-in-law found it necessary to depart for several days on business, the which sometimes carried him to his manufactories in London, or abroad to Paris and Vienna where he would make negotiations, purchases and sales- all such indeed as kept the two families in great comfort but which did nothing to alleviate the would-be stirring of Margaret's yearning hips.</p>
   <p>On such occasions she would feel herself more free and would retire or rise earlier or later than was her wont when Eric was about the house. The young people, too, would become more enlivened and on several occasions Margaret observed their rompings in the garden and the fact that Mabel lent herself, though coyly, to the occasional playful kisses and caresses of her cousin, George, the mere sight of which caused Margaret's belly to tingle so warmly that such vestiges of outward control as she had exerted over herself began to fall away.</p>
   <p>On this particular occasion Margaret had three days of her brother-in-law's absence to practise such naughtiness as she had been wont to do in the past, for her late husband had been like unto herself and the pair had had many 'entertainments', as they called them which had excited their loins to pitches of well-fulfilled desire with others.</p>
   <p>A-flutter with excitement, she was quick to realise what she might do and hence rose very early before the rest of the household were awake. Clad only in her nightgown which clung revealing to her form, she entered the bedroom which her nephews shared and saw them lying together abed-angelically, as it seemed to her.</p>
   <p>A floorboard creaked upon her entry and George awoke, blinking at the so unexpected vision the while that Margaret put her fingers to her lips. Approaching the bed on tiptoe, she bent and whispered, 'I have not been able to sleep and am cold. Will you not cuddle me, Georgie?'</p>
   <p>Nodding mutely as he observed better than ever before the wondrous gourds of her titties which half fell from the vent in her single garment, George unthinkingly slipped out of bed and in doing so brought his tummy to bear against his aunt's, who muffled a giggle thereat, for she had distinctly and hopefully felt the touch of his penis under his nightshirt.</p>
   <p>'Wait until we lie down, darling', she murmured boldly. Raising her filmy attire to the tops of her thighs and so affording him more wondrous sights, Margaret slid carefully down beside Freddy who was still dozing and in so doing presented her half-uncovered bottom to George who followed suit behind her.</p>
   <p>Unable to constrain herself, Margaret immediately urged her proud rump into him and, turning her neck, presented her lips close to his astonished own.</p>
   <p>'Oh, how nice', she breathed and, with that, eased her nightdress higher and so urged the entirety of her naked bottom against his cotton-shielded pego that George felt it rise in all its youthful ardour and press its thrumming stiffness against her brazen cleft.</p>
   <p>'Do not be afraid-do not be afraid, Georgy', Margaret coaxed. Still straining her face over her shoulder, she thereupon passed her broad, cowlike tongue into her nephew's mouth and, groping behind her, rucked up his bed-attire until his rigid cock came warmly into her clasp.-'Put it in!' Margaret thereupon choked against his lips and so guided the eager helmet that it found itself clipped between the large, fleshy cheeks of her bottom. A single backward urging of Margaret's hips sufficed then to permit it to make the first thrilling contact with her rosehole.</p>
   <p>'Gooo!' choked George who was not quite sure where it was but could feel a round, ridged and inviting aperture together with the rubbery bulbing of his aunt's bumcheeks into his bared belly.</p>
   <p>'P… p… push a little, Georgy', Margaret husked, though even as she spoke-and still clasping his tool-she so undulated her derriere to achieve a perfection of contact that with swimming head George felt his crest slip through the ring, taking his knob up within her.</p>
   <p>'Haaar!' sobbed his aunt in delight and, with a dazed feeling of delight such as she had not experienced for so long, let her bottom sink heavily down until inch by inch his penis became embedded in her channel which at first seemed impossibly tight to George who-much more emboldened-clasped her hips and with a little jerk thrust himself to the full up her wondrous bottom, causing both to gasp and their breaths to flow together.</p>
   <p>Despite the lubriciousness of their posture, their movements had been slow and cautious, but now Freddy stirred and awoke, feeling not only a strange and larger form behind him, but feeling too a hand stirring up under his attire to clasp his own small limp prick.</p>
   <p>'Ah! Who…?' he blurted, only to have his waist ringed by his aunt who hissed urgently, 'Be quiet, dear, we are enjoying ourselves. Oh, Georgy, yes, my darling, work it in and out! Bugger me! Is it not nice?'</p>
   <p>'Aunt-teee!' then groaned both boys together, for Freddy's own cock was already tingling with pleasure and stiffening under the subtle and well-practised caresses that her fingers were affording it.</p>
   <p>Feeling almost the same seizure of delight as his brother, Freddy made to turn and face his aunt, but was restrained from doing so by her firm grips upon him.</p>
   <p>'Let me! Lie still, Freddy', Margaret murmured, her eyes half closed in the blissful experience of having a youthful and virile prick where she most liked such to be, even as she liked frigging another at the same time and had done so several times, years before, under the eyes of her late husband who had much liked to see her so 'at play', as he had called it.- 'D… do not come yet, Georgy-try n… n… not to. Oh, it's so nice! Finger my cunt. Put your hand in front. There! AH! Yes!'</p>
   <p>'Aunty, Aunty, Aunty!' Freddy was choking out meanwhile. No one had ever played with his prick before and it was nigh on bursting.</p>
   <p>'Come, little dear, do naughty, do naughty all over my hand', purred Margaret. Her own fleshy hips were pumping vigourously in response to George's jerks and she knew that he could not hold out much longer, particularly as now he could already feel her salty, honeyed spurts over his fingers which rubbed wildly beneath her furred slit.</p>
   <p>'Geeee!' Freddy gritted. His cock felt all peppery and tingly and hot and there was a lovely swirling sensation in his balls that preceded the sudden explosion that occurred.</p>
   <p>His young stiff hosepipe then offered forth in a sudden, long spurt of come which Margaret could feel bubbling and dripping over her fingers.</p>
   <p>'C… come, Georgy, come… come up my bottom!' Margaret choked and then, ramming her ardent bottom tight down, received the urgent spurts of his libation which the squeezing of her tight channel made even more vi-gourous.</p>
   <p>Moaning and panting, all three thus loosed their passionate energies, the one spilling his sperm upon the sheet and Margaret's hand while Georgy inundated his aunt's bottom with the rich juice it so gladly received until after long moments of heaving and wriggling all three subsided and lay still, though Margaret continued possessively drawing upon her nephew's embedded weapon until the last pearls had been expended.</p>
   <p>The thought that she might then stay to work their cocks up again was tempting in the extreme, but Margaret decided upon discretion lest the girls awake and hear. Kissing both boys fondly, adjuring them to silence and promising them more pleasure, she drifted back to her room, slumped open-legged upon the bed and blissfully congratulated herself on her first new adventure.</p>
   <p>The first taste of new, forbidden fruit, however, tends to make the senses over-eager and the mind to become blurred to caution, and such it was with Margaret who in such relatively short time as she had to enjoy herself during Eric's absence sought ways of getting the other young people out of the way while she gave herself up to receiving the pricks of George and his younger brother. No matter how carefully and tactfully she endeavoured to do so-arranging picnics and such-the suspicions at least of Mabel were aroused. For upon their aunt's whispered instructions, George and Freddy pretended to be indisposed, though Mabel could see no sign of such and thought they looked in perfect health.</p>
   <p>This occurring on the day following Margaret's initiation of her nephews, she packed Alice, Mabel, Bertie and Hugh off with a luncheon basket to a nearby meadow, which even fifteen-year-old Alice thought was rather odd since they might just as well have lunched at home.</p>
   <p>'I wonder what IS wrong with Freddy and George', Mabel remarked casually to her slightly younger cousin, Hugh, while the two lay on their tummies on the grass, chewing at the white roots of long blades of grass and having separated themselves a little from the others.</p>
   <p>'Perhaps they are going to have the measles or something', Hugh replied vaguely, for he was of an age when he was far more interested in the luring hump of Mabel's bottom which showed plainly in her prone posture and indeed was slightly emphasised by it.</p>
   <p>'I don't think they are. Perhaps she is making the poor things do extra lessons or something. Anyway, I have forgotten my handkerchief, Hugh. I think I will go back and fetch it. Will you accompany me?'</p>
   <p>Telling the others they would not be long, Hugh was only too glad for the opportunity of being alone with this winsome, willowy cousin of his who had coyly lent her bottom several times to his tentative caresses and had even allowed him to kiss her on the lips, which experience he had found terribly exciting.</p>
   <p>Strolling down to the road and now and then touching hands together, the pair passed through a gate and were upon the road itself when Vanessa came along in her pony cart.</p>
   <p>As is common in country areas where people are more friendly than in the smoky grime of crowded towns, all passers-by tend to greet one another or at least to doff their hats or give similar salute. Thus Vanessa slowed her pony when she saw the young couple who looked rather toothsome to her view, particularly Mabel who had on a pretty blue hat with a white silk ribbon around the brim and whose flowing gown was of matching colours with a sash around her midriff that splendidly displayed the wasplike nature of her waist and therewith her already promising hips.</p>
   <p>It had been several days since Vanessa had first succumbed on the altar of Venus and to her vast amusement and pleasure she had been able to maintain her control over Reggie during that period, and with much assistance from Mary, of whom she was growing ever fonder. Spurning the would-be offerings of Reggie's pego herself, she had 'put him up' once to Mary who had dutifully knelt up on her Mistress's bed while Vanessa watched her brother perform from the rear on the girl, mischievously tapping his bare buttocks with a switch to make him groan betwixt pain and pleasure.</p>
   <p>Besides-as Vanessa assured herself-her brother was enjoying his new role just as was she herself. She had been intrigued, too, to find that her penchant was as much for the caresses of other young females as the sensation of taking a cock in her pussy. Girls were soft and warm and cuddly and knew better how to lick one's cunny than men did.</p>
   <p>Thus the rear view of Mabel, with her flowing locks, attracted Vanessa even more than the sight of her otherwise goodlooking companion and hence she reined in and greeted them, asking if they had far to go.</p>
   <p>'Oh no, it is but a mile', replied Mabel, whereat the three exchanged the usual courtesies of names and such and Vanessa encouraged them to squeeze up beside her on the slatted, padded seat which brought Mabel's thigh warmly to her own.</p>
   <p>In the general light chatter that followed, Vanessa learned why the couple were returning and offered to wait and take them back to their picnic spot. To her delight, Mabel not only agreed (for Hugh kept more shyly silent) but invited their new acquaintance to take refreshments with them at the house, this suggestion strengthening the slightly suspicious Mabel in her resolve to know whether her male cousins were still abed, or at their extra lessons, or what.</p>
   <p>A certain feminine caution overtaking her, however, she saw fit upon their arrival to conduct Vanessa and Hugh through the side entrance to the back of the house, which informality caused Vanessa's nostrils to twitch a little, since as all sensitive males are aware, there are certain silent communications that may be made between females which are rarely vouchsafed to the stronger sex.</p>
   <p>Taking the flagged path and finding the first of two entrances locked, the three repaired to the back where bow windows gave way into the morning room. Incautious in search of her immediate pleasures, Margaret had failed to draw the curtains together there, for the gardeners were busy out of sight and she had seen to it that the servants were otherwise occupied, having told the maids that she desired to work quietly with her nephews in the room.</p>
   <p>Such a sight as met the eyes of the three would-be entrants into the house, therefore, caused them to pause rigid, for Margaret was indeed working quietly, albeit in a way that none would have suspected. Her posture was her favourite one, for it was the first in which she had been coached in her distant youth. That is to say, Margaret had upped her skirts and-wearing no drawers-was sprawled over a small round table the edges of which she was able to grip with outstretched hands. Her feet were firmly spread on the floor and her dark-blue stockinged legs straddled to display the magnificently plump and fully-rounded derriere to which a delirious Freddy was giving first attention while George stood by with his trousers open, holding his own rigid cock in readiness for a second entry.</p>
   <p>Mabel's eyes were not the only things that bulged in that moment wherein she and Hugh and Vanessa had come to a sudden stop upon the sight of this revelation through the panes of glass. Margaret being in semi-profile to the unknown spectators, Hugh for one could clearly if unbelievingly see his younger cousin's rigid penis urging back and forth in the deep furrow betwixt his Mama's glorious nether cheeks.</p>
   <p>For a long moment the three stood breathing deeply but otherwise silent at the vision that was vouchsafed to them. Unable to resist, and having cast a knowing eye downwards at Hugh who stood between them, Vanessa casually brushed the back of her hand across the young man's growing erection.</p>
   <p>Clasping his aunt's out-curving hips, Freddy was by then pumping her welcoming bottomhole with all the youthful vigour that he could give to the task, while with every inward thrust Margaret's knuckles whitened excitedly, her face laid sideways on the polished table top and hence bringing into her passion-blurred and greedy vision the sight of the other waiting and equally virile penis that in short order was to afford her a second spermaceous dosage such as would cause her bottomhole to froth the more.</p>
   <p>'Ooh yes! Ooh Yes!' Hugh's Mama was distinctly heard to moan by the three silent witnesses whose own state of arousal became evident in the flushing of Mabel's and Va-nessa's faces and the increased pulsing of Hugh's stiff-standing cock which the latter female was by then more openly caressing through the cloth of his trousers.</p>
   <p>'Ooof! Ooofl ooogh!' Freddy was meanwhile heard to pant.</p>
   <p>'He is coming, I think', Vanessa whispered with a sense of self-possession that she could hardly credit in herself, and this remark caused Mabel to gape at her with prettily parted lips, though not for long, for the spectacle fascinated and disturbed her as much as it did the other two.</p>
   <p>'Hah! Yes, oh yes! Do more, Freddy! I can feel it, darling, shooting up my naughty bottom!' came Margaret's cry, for the first ecstatic shoot of her younger nephew's cock had just lubricated her bottom, and his panting delight knew no bounds. Gritting his teeth as the narrow but receptive channel gripped him gratefully-hanging his head then and working his loins furiously, Freddy expended his sperm for the first time in a female aperture and was never going to forget the experience, no more than George who, upon the slackening exit of his brother's tool, hurriedly brushed him aside and took post himself, slewing his prick immediately up into the depths of Margaret's derriere and causing her to cry out in delight.</p>
   <p>'Come away, dears' Vanessa uttered thickly, adding 'But we must be quiet. Have you a summerhouse to which we can repair?'</p>
   <p>'Th… there, yes, beyond the shrubbery', Mabel choked. Her titties felt fuller than they had ever done before. Her lips were dry and a faintness seized her which caused the stiff-walking Hugh to cast his arm solicitously around her waist while Vanessa took her arm on the other side. Un speaking then they coursed across the lawn and entered the hexagonal garden room in which Vanessa was pleased to find an old couch.</p>
   <p>'Mama! How could Mama…?' began Hugh in bewilderment while Mabel sat upon the couch and covered her face with blushing shyness.</p>
   <p>'Oh, you have much to learn, you two', laughed Vanessa disarmingly and so much so that Mabel dropped her hands and gazed up at her in awe.</p>
   <p>'But it is naughty!' Mabel uttered in bewilderment, even though Vanessa felt that she was bringing rather more shock into her voice than she really meant.</p>
   <p>'Naughty is a word, Mabel, and people live by deeds, not words. Poor Hugh-do you see the condition it has got him into? Must I put it into words?' Vanessa asked and thereupon slung one arm comfortingly about his own slender waist and with her free hand openly fondled his erection in front of Mabel's eyes.</p>

    <p>Chapter Eight</p>
   </title>
   <p>Vanessa's smile was so benevolent that both Mabel and Hugh appeared transfixed. Not only was her hand moving placatingly, urgingly, but to a distinct quivering and flushing from Hugh she had begun deftly to unbutton the front of his trousers, this gesture causing Mabel to cover her eyes once more, though-as Vanessa observed-she did not fail to peep through them.</p>
   <p>'You must learn, darlings. Do you think your dear Mama was really being terribly wicked, or was she not rather doing what all grown-ups do whenever they can?' Vanessa was asking Hugh softly, the while that she slowly eased up the tail-front and brought the youth's straining penis to light.</p>
   <p>'I… I… I…whoooo!' stammered Hugh who, being urged forward at the same time, found the rubicond head of his urgent charger within inches of his cousin's face where she sat.</p>
   <p>'Oh! What are you at? We should not!'-this being, of course, Mabel's brief cry as she glimpsed the intruder more clearly through her forked fingers.</p>
   <p>What Vanessa had learned, both through instinct and practise in the past few days, many young women take months or even years to learn. Within her vibrant form, however, had long lurked fires of passion which-the Vicar having caused to smoulder the more-had now burst forth in her with radiant desire from behind her previous shields of pride and stubbornness. Possessively, victoriously, she slid her hand down Hugh's pulsing weapon and grasped the root of it while gently smacking Mabel's hands away and then delicately pinching the girl's nose.</p>
   <p>Vanessa would have had to admit that this little trick had been relayed to her by Mary who had suffered it-if such is the word-in her fifteenth year when she was first introduced to the cock. That it worked was indubitable, for while the girl's face was held, her mouth was also caused to open in order to take in breath.</p>
   <p>'Suck it, Mabel, for then you will be the first to have given your cousin pleasure, my dear, and thereby will gain much yourself. Besides, it has a nice taste', Vanessa averred, though in truth she had yet to taste male sperm herself.</p>
   <p>A great puffing sound came from Mabel, but too late, for Vanessa had already pulled Hugh forward a little more (with such ruthlessness as she often practised on her brother now) and inserted the crest of his pego between the girl's soft, open lips. Every effort thereafter on Mabel's part to shake her head was in vain. The meaty young shaft slid over her tongue, the distance of its entry being nicely judged by Vanessa who thereupon commenced frigging Hugh with all the allure that her fingers had so recently learned.</p>
   <p>Responding haplessly and with a glorious sense of fire in his loins, Mabel's cousin assisted in the gentle back-and-forth motions of his cock within her warm moist mouth, his eyes half closing as the most delirious of sensations overcame him. Mabel then, too, closed her eyes as if she did not wish to see what was actually happening, though the bulbous soothing of the nose of Hugh's cock over her tongue was beginning more and more to excite her.</p>
   <p>Implacably and pleasurably, Vanessa listened to the groans of Hugh, for while part of her still held a desire to submit to the male, she took even greater joy in causing them to weaken themselves by their emissions, which she considered a great failure on the part of the male apparatus, being able herself-like many passionate women-to come many times in abundance and thereafter being ready for more.</p>
   <p>His knees were quivering, she saw. That was a good sign.</p>
   <p>'Suck, Mabel!' she commanded. 'Draw your cheeks in'.</p>
   <p>Mabel gulped and obeyed. She had heard that a thick creamy fluid came out of a man's cock, but she had never seen it-nor even had she seen an erect penis before.</p>
   <p>'I am going to release your nose now, Mabel, but do not withdraw your mouth, dear, for your cousin is about to fill it with his sperm', she heard, and with relief felt the firm pinching of her nostrils cease, though hardly two or three seconds passed then before Hugh loosed his violent emission. Still having one finger curled around the base of his tool, Vanessa knowingly felt the increased throbbing and with equal anticipation cast her free hand behind Mabel's head to hold it still while the gruelly substance jetted and splashed over her tongue and in part down her throat, causing her to gurgle.</p>
   <p>Hugh's cock then becoming more thickly oiled, he was able to move it faster and did so as more spurts succeeded until at last the drooping head popped out of Mabel's mouth, brushed her chin, and sank a little.</p>
   <p>For Vanessa, the young male was finished with for the nonce, but Mabel was not. As Hugh moved weakly aside and collapsed in a sitting posture on the end of the couch, so the young woman cast herself upon Mabel and bore her back with her head upon the single cushion.</p>
   <p>'Oooh-wer!' gasped Mabel (rather thickly, it must be said), for the assault was as unexpected as had been the first event and Vanessa's hands were already sweeping up her light summer dress and finding to her delight that the girl wore split drawers. Hence Mabel's plump young quim received an immediate tickling which made her bottom bounce amourously. Vanessa's tongue plunged into her mouth, thus giving her the strange but exciting taste with which Mabel's tongue was coated.</p>
   <p>'Do not think-just do. Draw up my dress and feel me, too', Vanessa murmured hotly in between the lips of Mabel who then-receiving such a permission as she never had before and finding herself more eager as each moment passed-groped, felt and found. Her soft fingertips caressed first the tight bands of Vanessa's stockings, then the creamy, silky flesh above, then found the richer curves of the young woman's bottom which, unlike Mabel's, was not sheathed.</p>
   <p>Goggle-eyed and almost falling off the end of the couch, Hugh watched the couple in a dreamy fashion; for he was beginning to believe that all was a dream and that by no stretch of the imagination could he ever have seen his voluptuous Mama with her drawers off as well and his cousin's prick between her bottom cheeks.</p>
   <p>Even so, he idly groped-groped a hand that grew ever greedier and to Mabel's mingled dismay and excitement touched her own fingers as they roamed the rolling hemispheres that Vanessa now betrayed to Hugh's searching eyes.</p>
   <p>'Both of you, yes!' came Vanessa's cry. 'Play with my cunny, Hugh, while Mabel tickles up my bottomhole-oh yes!'</p>
   <p>A greater fervour seizing her, Vanessa blindly sought both their hands and placed them where she wanted them while Hugh already felt a renewed tingling in the sperm-smeared head of his knob. That which he found was furry, plump and had two rolled lips into which his finger amateurishly slipped. Her lessons well learned from Mary, Vanessa thereupon forced apart the gap in Mabel's drawers the more and brought her quim to rub against the girl's.</p>
   <p>Mabel moaned in delight. Her lips opened more to accept Vanessa's passionate kisses. Encouraged by the lifting motions of Vanessa's hands under her thighs, she ringed the young woman's waist with her crossed calves and heaved and squirmed and sobbed until delicious, creamy rivulets coursed from both their cunts while Hugh-ignored and almost bereft-could do naught in his naivete other than fondle and kiss Vanessa's heaving bottom cheeks as well as he could.</p>
   <p>'How long have we been here? Oh, my goodness-the others-they will wonder where we are', came Mabel's soft, satisfied murmur long moments later.</p>
   <p>'Perhaps, yes', Vanessa replied thoughtfully while Hugh still sat like one at a party who is not sure whether he has been invited or not.</p>
   <p>Thereupon all restored order while Hugh cast lingering glances at both their shapely legs before they were duly covered.</p>
   <p>'Really, I have never done such a thing before', Mabel said suddenly and could scarce look her cousin in the eyes.</p>
   <p>'Then more's the pity that you have not, my pets, but you are ready to again, at the least. As to you, Hugh, you will not berate nor embarrass your Mama, I trust, for the dear lady was only doing what we all wish to. No, on reflection, I am sure you would be too timid to mention it, the which is a pity, for you must not be too backward in addressing yourselves to ladies. Indeed you might be a comfort to her yourself, did you but know it. But come', went on Vanessa before the pair could find reply to her bold proclamation, 'we must not dally, as you said. The scenes of pleasure will be over in the house by now, though even so we should tread carefully and not allow ourselves to be seen'.</p>
   <p>'Shall you call on us, perhaps?' Mabel asked timidly, for very much like Vanessa-though she could not have guessed it-a whole new world had opened up to her.</p>
   <p>'I may. Yes, I believe I will. I will leave my <emphasis>carte de visile </emphasis>in a day or two at least', Vanessa replied with caution, for she had other things, too, on her mind. Reggie had already confessed to her the Vicar's intentions in respect of other young ladies and had even had forced from him by both his sister and Mary the role that he was intended to play therein.</p>
   <p>'You will do nothing save what I intend you to, Reginald', Vanessa had said with such hauteur as befitted the times when he was being berated or taught a further lesson. 'You may, of course, be accorded certain benefits. As to that we shall have to see', she had concluded. Her affair with the Vicar was not yet finished, she had decided, for-taking a feather from her brother's cap, as it were-it had occurred to her that such girls as the Rev. Jubstone might lure into his private sanctum would be of as much use to her as to himself.</p>
   <p>But at the least now, Vanessa had taken her second most important step in her new life by commencing the induction of two young people who would now come under her wing if she wished them to. Hence Vanessa privately decided, upon taking her farewell of Mabel and Hugh, to indeed make a call and therewith the closer acquaintance of the latter's lubricious Mama, who, she had good cause to consider, was less discreet than herself.</p>
   <p>As for Hugh, he had great cause now to scowl at his cousins and wished to, but made as much effort as he could to put on a good front. Margaret herself, being in a slight state of conscience at the way she had had to manoeuvre events, observed her son's unease and wondered what could have brought it about, for he was wont normally to lark and tumble with Frank and George.</p>
   <p>Thus it was that with naught but motherly care, as she told herself, Margaret decided to make as silent as possible a visit to Hugh's room that night in order to extract from him what was wrong-if anything other than a moodiness of youth. That she might have done so fully dressed did not seem to occur to her. Attired solely in a crimson nightdress of silk, edged with white lace, she entered his bedroom and found him lying upon his bed in his nightshirt in quite a dreamlike state from the events of the day.</p>
   <p>The maternal and yet voluptuous vision that thus appeared almost silently before him in the gloom served rather to excite his thoughts than otherwise as Margaret seated herself on the side of the bed and asked him what ailed him.</p>
   <p>'Nothing-nothing at all, Mama', answered Hugh petulantly while his eyes did not fail to observe the thick and promising nipples that indented the silk which also flowed revealingly about her thighs and hips. Her tits wobbled heavily, complementing the weight of her full bottom of which Hugh had already seen more than he ever dreamed he would.</p>
   <p>'Why, there must be something you have to tell your Mama', Margaret soothed, subsiding beside him and raising her legs so that they lay alongside and in utterly disturbing nearness to his own.</p>
   <p>'Really, Mama…', Hugh began for in one way he wished to be left alone with his stirring visions of what had passed, though equally the warm bulging of her breasts to his arm stirred him as well. Knowing not which way to turn, he finally uttered what seemed to Margaret a doleful murmur and, rolling on his hip, cuddled into her much as he had done when little.</p>
   <p>'Tell Mama', urged Margaret who then to her immense</p>
   <p>surprise (or so she would have avowed) experienced the straining of her son's stiff penis against her belly, the knob being distinctly felt against her skin through the flimsy attire of the pair.</p>
   <p>'Nothing', muttered Hugh again, though more shamefacedly, for a slight movement of his balls had caused them to swing for a moment and make the most moving of additional contacts against the thick brush of her mount whose curls burred through the silk.</p>
   <p>'There must be something', Margaret uttered rather chok-ily. Being aware that she should draw her form back, she yet failed to do so and fell into an even greater laxity of posture from which she told herself she ought to stir. Second by second Hugh's cock seemed to grow even stiffer, impinging its length and heat into her flesh.</p>
   <p>'Dunno', came her son's muffled murmur, for that which he wished to tell her he dare not, and that which he could not dare frustrated him the more. Throwing his upper arm impetuously around her waist, he rubbed himself pupplike against her, causing Margaret a great confusion of sensations for his weapon was gliding up and down her belly with a message that needed no translation.</p>
   <p>'Hugh-IE!' uttered she, though it was little but a whimper and one that persuaded her son that her desires in that moment were no less than his own.</p>
   <p>'Ma-ma!' responded Hugh in a tone that was at once wheedling, passionate and petulant. His hands clasped the rearing cheeks of her bottom which he could feel so exciting full through the silk. His fingers dug into the resilient half-moons, causing her nightgown to ruck up until his risen prick urged against her naked thigh.</p>
   <p>Swimmy with desire and yet telling herself to stop, Margaret defensively slid her hand between their bodies and clasped his rigid weapon, causing Hugh to groan with delight and to attempt to rub it in her palm.</p>
   <p>'No, Hughie, no, darling, this must stop!'</p>
   <p>'Mama, please, let me kiss it!'</p>
   <p>'Kiss what, kiss what?' asked Margaret chokily while endeavouring to use all her will-power not to fondle his throb-ber.</p>
   <p>'Please, your thing-you know-in between…'</p>
   <p>'Hughie, no! Oh my goodness! Remember who I am! Such things can never be!' cried his Mama who seemed momentarily to forget what she herself was so firmly grasping. Whether it was a fear of some untoward interruption that would find her in an even more guilty condition than were she sporting with her nephews, or whether she was actually resisting her own desires, she was not sure. Betwixt the two thoughts, she unleashed her fingers from around her son's very promising pego and rolled quickly off the bed to flounder to the door with her nightdress looped up halfway to her thighs.</p>
   <p>'No, Hughie-oh, you naughty boy, you must never, never; do you hear?'</p>
   <p>Her wild look perhaps betrayed her, though it was concealed from Hugh in the dark of the bedroom, and then she was gone. Throwing herself upon her bed, she lay upon her back with her knees drawn up and began dreamily, passionately toying with her sticky-moist and longing slit while a bereft Hugh lay in a similar pose, bumping his hips with abandon and frigging himself in a maze of ecstastic dreams until his fervent sperm jetted into the air and formed pools upon the sheet between his legs.</p>

   <title>
    <p>Chapter Nine</p>
   </title>
   <p>At the first, Margaret had not listened overmuch to Mabel's account of how they had met a 'very nice lady' who, it appeared, had recently moved into the district. Upon giving the matter more cogitation, however, it began to occur to her that such an acquaintanceship would be a fine way of getting some of the young people out of the house more often. The following morning, therefore, she evinced more interest in Vanessa and learned that her age was 'perhaps'-so Mabel said-about twenty-seven or so.</p>
   <p>'How pleasant it will be for all of us to know her, then', Margaret remarked, much to the secret pleasure of Mabel who thereupon, with her aunt's accord, wrote a pleasant little note to Vanessa inviting her to come to tea.</p>
   <p>Vanessa did not fail to respond in a like manner, though meanwhile she had had other things to do, having elicited from her now submissive brother almost all that had transpired in his conversation with the Vicar. Thus she knew of the imminent visit of an otherwise unknown girl, young Sally, to the Vicarage and with due aplomb made her appearance there a short while before the new supplicant was due to arrive.</p>
   <p>Being utterly delighted to see her after the unexpected rebuff he had received upon meeting Vanessa in the lane, the Vicar showed such caution as he felt was necessary and permitted the conversation to flow from her rather than from himself. Alarmingly at first he thus began to understand that his beautiful visitor knew far more than he had ever hoped she would and indeed had appeared to have become quite transformed.</p>
   <p>'How old is the girl who is to visit you tonight in preparation-as I understand it-for her confirmation?' Vanessa asked after the polite preliminaries had been exchanged.</p>
   <p>'Sixteen, my dear', replied the cleric who from her calm demeanour saw no point in beating about the bush. As he spoke, so Vanessa laid down her glass of welcoming sherry and waved away his attempt to refill it.</p>
   <p>'It may be that we shall come to an understanding', she said to his amazement, though this he concealed and asked warily, 'In what way, my dear?'</p>
   <p>'In such a way as will benefit us both. Did I not act out my own part with you admirably?' Vanessa lied glibly, and then continued, 'You will thus be aware that I can play many parts. You have a penchant for young girls. It is common among men-less so among women, but there are other females such as myself who have what may be called…'</p>
   <p>'Dual tastes?' put in the Vicar politely, and received a nod that was more grateful than he could have known.</p>
   <p>'Precisely. Your housekeeper, whom I have just briefly met, is no doubt a splendid woman, but perhaps does not possess the finesse that I could bring to certain occasions. In permitting you such as I may concerning my own person, I require the return of favours from yourself. That is to say', Vanessa said, looking most earnest as she leaned upon his desk, 'There are occasions when I shall assist you. Such as with Sally'.</p>
   <p>'Ah… Yes', came the response. 'The dear child is due at any minute, of course'.</p>
   <p>'Quite. I shall stay in that case. Will you prepare her here-upon the couch, perhaps?'</p>
   <p>'If you would find it convenient'.</p>
   <p>Percy smiled broadly for the first time, rose and encircled the desk and drew Vanessa up into his arms, fondling her bottom with both hands-she permitting this for but half a minute before pushing them away.</p>
   <p>'Later perhaps. She will no doubt be virginal, in which case…'</p>
   <p>'My dear Miss Markham-permit me to interrupt, if I may. Sally is from a poor family whose accommodation permits of little privacy. Brothers and sisters must necessarily sleep in the same small rooms in such cottage abodes. She may already have done a little cock-fiddling-if I dare call it such-or have been drawn to it. The pubescent delights of such young girls frequently permit them to be mounted in the dark. Why, I have heard of girls whose fathers…'</p>
   <p>'Oh, really, Vicar!' Vanessa interjected, turning her back upon him and a slight flush coming into her neck.</p>
   <p>'Do I offend you? In view of our mutual desires, do I offend you? Let us speak plainly, Miss Markham. The parental cock is frequently the first to spout within their cun-nies or their bottoms'.</p>
   <p>'But how can the girls enjoy such?' came Vanessa's softly-put question, for she was inwardly all a-quiver to know the nature of his reply. His hands then soothed her hips while she kept her back to him.</p>
   <p>'There is petulance at first-sometimes, my dear. It depends much upon the nature of the girl and whether she has been handled first and drawn to the idea. I know of a lordly gentleman hereabouts-one with a considerable estate-who caused a mare and a stallion from his stables to be brought into a field which could be closely seen from a rear bedroom window of the house'.</p>
   <p>'Yes? To what effect and to what purpose?' asked Vanessa chokily for she could also feel that the Vicar's penis had stiffened and was pressing ardently against her bumptious rear cheeks through their clothing.</p>
   <p>'To a delightful purpose and an appropriate effect, my dear. First he caused the elder of his daughters to observe the scene. As the stallions's great penis rose and while the mare waited patiently, so the girl would have turned away, saying that she had other things to do'.</p>
   <p>'By which she meant she could not bring herself to watch but also could not bring herself to say so'.</p>
   <p>'Exactly, Miss Markham. Even so she was gentry stayed from moving and with much confusion, wonder and blushing watched the insertion of the giant Priapus into the waiting mare who-being on heat-did not start away. A fascination in the scene began to take the dear girl and indeed so much so that she apparently failed to notice that her Papa's hand had begun caressing her bottom'.</p>
   <p>'Which she was also too embarrassed or shy to refuse'.</p>
   <p>'Your sensitivity is remarkable, my dear. Inch by inch her dress was drawn up at the back until her thighs and knickered bottom were exposed to the licentious roaming of fingers such as could not fail to arouse her. Giving way to a sensation of swooning, she allowed her head to sink upon his shoulder. While both continued observing the lusty combat, so her drawers were slowly loosed and commenced descending to her ankles'.</p>
   <p>'She dry-mouthed and open-eyed with wonder, I imagine', Vanessa said thickly and kept her own head hung, as if coyly.</p>
   <p>'You imagine well. This silent play continuing, the girl was brought slowly and submissively to bend more and thereby to rest her elbows upon the windowsill. A single smack upon her nether cheeks provided the authoritative command for her to remain thus still.'</p>
   <p>'And then-and then…' Vanessa's voice was all but breathless.</p>
   <p>'Thereupon, of course, her sire moved to her rear and produced his own prick, telling her at the same time to watch and that-as he quaintly put it-what she was observing was a particular call of Nature of which all had need. This being said, and her legs parted as much as her fallen drawers would allow, he entered his penis slowly up into her cunt and proceeded to plough her slowly'.</p>
   <p>'I wonder if she cried'. This time Vanessa produced a pensive tone.</p>
   <p>'Upon watching and experiencing such? To the contrary, my dear, she became slowly and passionately responsive, he causing her nether cheeks to smack against his belly with every inward surging of his proud penis until both were blind with pleasure and seeking only the delicious outcome of their mutual spillings'.</p>
   <p>'How wickedly crude!' With deliberation, but some effort, Vanessa drew her own bottom away from the pulsing she could feel through his trouser cloth and went herself to the window and gazed out pensively upon the rural scene through the panes of leaded glass. 'How do you know this? Do gentlemen talk so of their most private conquests?'</p>
   <p>'I trust they would not. Damned ungentlemanly, if you will forgive the term. No, Miss Markham, I learned all from the young lady herself. Having been twice spermed by her sire thereafter, she entered such a period of recalcitrance as some young ladies are wont to do. Hence I-being merely told that she needed guidance-received her here and strapped her soundly several times. I am pleased to say…'</p>
   <p>'Oh, you have no need to go on. I understand such things. I, too, have heard of them. It is useful for me to know how broad <emphasis>your </emphasis>knowledge is', Vanessa uttered simply, though indeed so many things were new to her. But all was buzzing in her busy head and sending her such signals as she needed then.</p>
   <p>Sounds then coming from the hall, and the arrival of Sally being indicated, Vanessa removed her broad-brimmed hat and gloves. Putting them to one side, she seated herself sedately, picking up the first book her hands could find.</p>
   <p>Had the Vicar not had to prepare himself for the opening of the door, he might have nastily taken it from her hands. For though bound in leather and having ribs upon the spine, as Vanessa immediately perceived, this was no printed tome but the cleric's diary. To her own amusement she was thus able to peruse a number of pages quickly in the moments that followed. For it suited Vanessa's mood to remain quiet and seemingly unconcerned upon the entry of Sally into the study. Not bothering to listen to the Vicar's rumblings to the girl, whose slim and nubile figure Vanessa quickly and pleasurably took in, she continued idly thumbing pages until a few names met her eyes which made her start.</p>
   <p><emphasis>Must bear in mind</emphasis>-Vanessa read in the Vicar's neat hand-<emphasis>two excellent young parishioners, Alice and Mabel Partridge, offspring of Mr. Eric Partridge whose propriety and standing in the community cannot be in doubt. Attendance must surely be needed, however, on these two winsome girls. Mabel has already been confirmed-though not by me and not in the manner most suitable to her charms. Alice must surely be almost ready for such and will otherwise, I fear, remain neglected in this respect. Particular discretion to be called for. Much thought to be given to the matter. Young Alice is decidedly toothsome and needs to have her bottom put up without too much delay. Such as I have seen of Mabel in the pew would indicate to me a roguish side to her nature such as may indicate the possibility of having the pair together. The older might help to monitor the pleasures of the other in due course.</emphasis></p>
   <p>Vanessa could not help but smile at the temerity of the entry, and of others similar to it. With a sigh that the Vicar could not help but notice, she placed the diary to one side and attended to what was happening.</p>
   <p>He had by then risen and stood over Sally, placing his hands on her svelte young hips.</p>
   <p>'We must assure ourselves first that you have been a good girl', he declared which Vanessa decided to take as her cue for she thereupon uttered Sally's name, bringing the girl to turn shyly to her.</p>
   <p>'Come here, dear', murmured Vanessa with a charming smile and while extending her hand. Clasping the tentatively offered one that Sally fluttered, Vanessa drew her to her side and, from the comfort of her chair, ringed her waist.</p>
   <p>'Really, Sally, what the good Vicar meant to say is that it is not so much a question of being good, but of being obedient. After all, it is rather dull being good ALL the time, is it not? Really I quite hate to be', Vanessa said confidentially, and this bringing a pleased smile to Sally's lips.</p>
   <p>'Well, mostly, Miss, I am good'.</p>
   <p>'Mostly, but not always, eh? Well, dear, that is the best of ways to tread, for we do not want everyone to know our business, do we?'</p>
   <p>Thereat even more pleasure evinced itself in the young girl's expression, for it is undoubtedly true that females have a greater penchant for saying such than males, and Sally could hardly believe that a real lady was being so friendly and so sympathetic to her. Indeed, so closely did this feeling cling to her that she appeared either not to notice or not to fret too much as the hand that had been about her waist moved slowly and began gathering up the back of her simple cotton dress.</p>
   <p>'Firstly, you have to have a little examination, you know. Were you told of such?'</p>
   <p>'Father said as I was to obey the Vicar in all respects, Miss'.</p>
   <p>'Precisely, dear, in ALL, and your obedience shall be duly rewarded. I warrant that you can always do with some new drawers, can you not?' Vanessa asked. Being convinced that a girl of Sally's station would probably not possess any, she cast her hand up without further delay beneath the thin dress and found, as she expected, a naked apple of a bottom, pert and warm. Therewith she brought Sally round more to the front of her chair and with a gay laugh so drew upon her with her own legs clipped together that the girl fell upon them and so straddled her, causing her head to rest on Vanessa's shoulder.</p>
   <p>'Oh, Miss, what are you…?'</p>
   <p>'Shush, dear, it is but part of your examination', Vanessa replied, bringing a tickling finger under the soft, furry slit she found between Sally's thighs and being able at the same time to gaze over the girl's shoulder at the wondering and excited cleric who was already displaying a huge bulge in his trousers but fortunately remained motionless, as she wished him to.</p>
   <p>'Kissing is nice, Sally. Do you like kissing? Let me feel how you kiss. Do you use your tongue? I hope you do'.</p>
   <p>All this being said in one breath as if to prevent any exclamations from the young supplicant, Vanessa then turned Sally's head and brought her lips to mesh with hers while gently agitating her finger until Sally's breath puffed excitedly into Vanessa's mouth.</p>
   <p>'You do, oh you do, and so do I. Extend your tongue more into my mouth', Vanessa husked, feeling the cream-iness of the girl's tight honeypot increasing every moment while her briefly emerging finger glistened under the seeking eyes of the Vicar who stood in readiness before her and thus had a splendid view of Sally's tight young derriere which Vanessa lifted up for him. Happily feeling her tongue smeared with the girl's saliva, she again brought Sally's head tight into her shoulder, saying, 'It is nice. Isn't it nice?' and therewith ruffling up the cotton dress the more until- gathering a petticoat with it-she was able to bare not only Sally's hips and waist but her firmly-jellied titties as well. Drawing back her elbows so that she could cup them in her hands, Vanessa thus held the girl while the Vicar bared his doughty tool.</p>
   <p>'Oh, Miss!' sobbed Sally in excitement and wonder, for the shuffling sounds she could hear behind her were not entirely unknown in nature to her, and at the next moment her hips were taken by the cleric who so lifted her that Sally was forced to throw her arms about Vanessa's neck and cling to her much like a child to its mother.-'NOOO!' came her gasp as the ruddy helmet of the hugely stiff penis intruded between her pouting lovelips and rode its way slowly twixt the clinging walls.</p>
   <p>'Yes, Sally, for the Vicar is but examining your font of desire with his sceptre. Let it go in-right in'.</p>
   <p>'Gooo!' Sally choked, for the throbbing staff was even bigger than the one she had already received several times while lying on her straw pallet at home. Its menacing thickness and length invaded her with such due care as Percival always lent to his devotions with young girls. A little nervous jerking of Sally's hips then sufficed to lodge him home securely until his big balls hung beneath her curls.</p>
   <p>At that, Sally's fingernails dug into Vanessa's neck, but the young woman did not mind. The sight of a rearing penis delighted her now as did the slightly strained expression on the male's face-whoever he might be-as he went about his pleasure.</p>
   <p>'Hah! I can't!' Sally sobbed-even though she was.</p>
   <p>One hand of Vanessa's prevented the girl's head from rising from its niche between her shoulder and her neck. Delicately reaching down Sally's back with the other and finally brushing the Vicar's glistening pestle in the process, Vanessa brought the tip of one finger to bear delicately against Sally's rosehole which she commenced to rub slowly around the puckered rim.</p>
   <p>Until Vanessa had witnessed what she had of Margaret and her nephews, Vanessa had not considered-nor even dreamed of-the possibility whereby the male organ might enter up into such an even more intimate aperture. It was surely too tight, she thought, as many untutored young females do. Yet she had witnessed it and clearly Mabel's aunt had much enjoyed the wicked deed. Experimentally then, Vanessa carefully inserted her fingertip, bringing Sally to moan and wriggle the more.</p>
   <p>The Vicar meanwhile was slowly pistoning his tool back and forth in the deliciously lubricated channel which Sally haplessly afforded him. Had he had the girl on his own, he would have strapped or caned her first, but opportunities to engage two females at once came rarely and his eyes burned into Vanessa's the while that, despite her inner excitation, she regarded him more cooly.</p>
   <p>It was enough for her at the moment-now that Sally's cunny was receiving a plunger-that her finger was easily able now to insert itself deeper up the girl's bottom with no more than seemingly agreeable whimpers emanating from her. Sally's bottomhole tightened like a baby's mouth about her finger and seemed to draw upon it and encourage it, the which enchanted Vanessa for she knew then more about it all.</p>
   <p>'Draw her back, but hold it in. I wish to get out of the chair', Vanessa announced suddenly, this bringing a wail from Sally who tried to enfold her neck more tightly.</p>
   <p>'No, Sally, you must learn, my pet', Vanessa admonished her softly and loosed the girl's arms while the Vicar lodged himself in deep and pulled her back so that she floundered with her arms and then-as Vanessa eased up-found her forearms pressed upon the seat.</p>
   <p>'Fuck her! Fuck her slowly and thoroughly, Vicar', Vanessa uttered, standing with legs akimbo, hands on her hips and her eyes flashing. That she was in command she had no doubt, for the pair were in the middle of a flight of Venus and could not bring themselves to stop.</p>
   <p>A snorting of delight broke from the Vicar who then caused the young girl's bottom to smack more vigourously into him while his penis pistoned back and forth and bubbling sounds emerged from Sally's mouth.</p>
   <p>That she could observe without even toying with herself pleased Vanessa. The emergence and re-entry of the throbbing fleshly rod fascinated her as did the mouthing of Sally's cuntlips around the flashing stem.</p>
   <p>'Faster now, a little faster now', Vanessa ordained.</p>
   <p>'Of course, my dear. The girl is in great need of it. I shall sluice her channel in a minute, anyway', the Vicar grunted, being both amused and bemused to find himself under instruction.</p>
   <p>'Pull your cock out and let me see it spout right at the mouth of her cunny, then', Vanessa said without thought, though much delighted with herself. The whim seemingly pleased the Vicar, too, for after half a dozen lusty thrusts he withdrew his steaming weapon to the brink, letting it emerge beyond so that the swollen knob just touched the lovelips of the girl.</p>
   <p>Precisely at that moment, Sally sprayed her own pleasure again which so stung and teased his crest that Percival immediately produced his foaming jets that splashed about her open cunny everywhere, his eyes half closing as he did, then slid within again and spouted his last jets.</p>
   <p>Catching the tottering girl as the Vicar finally unsaddled himself, Vanessa drew Sally up and cuddled her.</p>
   <p>'You are a good girl', she said simply, and Sally blushed and hid her face while Vanessa soothed her quivering bottom cheeks.</p>

    <p>Chapter Ten</p>
   </title>
   <p>The <emphasis>sight </emphasis>of the Vicar's diary had offered up to Vanessa even greater possibilities along the paths to pleasure, and these she made plain as soon as Sally had departed clutching a sovereign.</p>
   <p>The Vicar listened to her bemused, pensive but not displeased, for in his turn the prospects of collaboration with this remarkable young woman were growing on him.</p>
   <p>'Mabel Partridge has tendencies we may well encourage, but as to Alice I prefer to deal with her myself, having already made her close acquaintance', said she with the certainty of one who knows she can tell a story or two and get away with it. 'As to other young girls-such as my brother teaches, I may favour you with some of them'.</p>
   <p>'Will you, indeed', he had replied at first, whereat Vanessa had trailed a finger up and down his trouser front.</p>
   <p>'You must not forget that I am in possession of some of your secrets now. What a pity if some were to be discovered and you unfrocked! We must not allow that to happen, must we? Follow my whims, my dear, and I will in great part help to cloak our pleasurable activities. From the look in your eyes when Sally was lapping my cunny with her tongue afterwards, that was the first time you had seen two females in congress together. With my help you may see many more. Would you not like to?' she asked beguilingly.</p>
   <p>'Let me have you', rejoined he hoarsely, gathering up her skirts anew. Not many minutes had passed since Vanessa had stood with straddled thighs, hands on hips, bared to her belly while Sally had knelt between her legs and licked her slit until Vanessa's eyelashes had quivered and she had spilled over the girl's tongue.</p>
   <p>'Are you ready again so soon? I do not wonder that you have a reputation for it', Vanessa teased. While he cupped her quim, she responsively handled his great horny charger which was throbbing anew.</p>
   <p>'Lie down and I will show you'.</p>
   <p>'But how conventional, Vicar! Pray let us do something different. Come'.</p>
   <p>'What…?' began the surprised cleric, finding himself being led forward by his stiff charger-a simple exercise that Vanessa practised on Reggie now and which she enjoyed.</p>
   <p>'Against the wall, my dear. How deliciously common and wicked! Wait, let me pull my dress right up. Push your trousers down or the buttons will rub me. Indeed, take your jacket off.</p>
   <p>Lured and impelled by this curious whim on her part, the Vicar found himself obeying. Reaching up on tiptoe and with legs well spread and knees bent a little, Vanessa turned her face sideways with one cheek against the wall much as she had begun to fancy watching another young woman doing. Groping blindly down even while the Vicar fumbled for entry into her well-bushed nest, she hissed 'Wait!' and guided his knob within her slit.</p>
   <p>'Slowly! I want you to imagine that you are training Mabel Partridge', Vanessa murmured while he amourously licked around her neck. The word 'perform' came into her mind then. Reggie performed at her desire now; other males might have to.-'You are performing on her, do you understand?'</p>
   <p>'Yes', responded the cleric, easing his meaty rod up into the velvety, clenching aperture, causing Vanessa's stockinged legs to strain deliciously.</p>
   <p>'Perhaps she may struggle', husked the Vicar, entering well into the spirit of the game.</p>
   <p>'She may. We must devise methods. Oooh, yes-that is VERY NICE! Are you-mmmmmm! — right in?'</p>
   <p>'Now-yes-ah! — to my balls, Miss Markham. I can feel your curls rubbing mine. Did your Papa never tickle them for you?'</p>
   <p>'Perhaps. You do not need to know. His prick was as big as yours, I know, for I felt it through his trousers several times. I saw him-oooh! go on! — f… fuck his married sister once when both were in their cups. Mama watched them upon the floor, bumping and moaning, but it was too quick. I know not if they often did it thus. I peeped and saw and ran away. Mama encouraged them, I think, but only when tipsy, do you understand?'</p>
   <p>'Such delights are frequent hereabouts, my dear. Ah, you wish to struggle, do you?' the Vicar asked as Vanessa pushed her hands against his chest.</p>
   <p>'It is naughty, don't! Oh, you bad man! Take it out!'</p>
   <p>'No, my girl, you have to be spermed frequently, do you not? Hold your legs wider or I'll smack them both', the Vicar growled, pinning Vanessa's shoulders to the wall.</p>
   <p>'Yoo-hooo! I'll tell Mama, I will!'</p>
   <p>'She has the benefit of several cocks already, my pet; you have no need to, though if you wish to entertain her then you may tell her how well you wriggled your bottom. Come now, girl, push down on to my prick as you shortly must for others, too'.</p>
   <p>'Whooo!' moaned Vanessa realistically, though in truth as much excited by her multifarious thoughts as by the pistoning of his prick in her slit. Like all women, she had a whim sometimes to be mastered by the male, if only in a temporary manner, and the fierce pressing of her shoulders to the wall while her cunny swallowed up the shunting movements of his throbbing pego added to her pleasures.- 'What you do-oooh-ing!' she whined, continuing the little play.</p>
   <p>'Preparing to lubricate your nest with my abundant sperm-that which will leap up from my balls and flood your cunt, my sweet. Is this truly the first time you have had it creamed?'</p>
   <p>'Of course it is, you naughty man-whooo-ow! Ah, you are making me feel strange!'</p>
   <p>'Hah! You are sprinkling!' chanted the Vicar as he felt the fine spurts of salty rain trickling down his prick. Swaying her hips from side to side, Vanessa rolled her eyes and moaned. His words came to her in a blur of sound, her belly melting, sensations of both fire and ice causing her to jerk agitatedly and hiss out her pleasure.</p>
   <p>'Fuck me, you brute! Sperm me-do me! Ah yes-ah!'</p>
   <p>The Vicar's hands fell from Vanessa's shoulders as the moment of extreme bliss overcame him. Instead, he cupped her rumptious, fleshy bottom cheeks, drawing them apart and so holding them spread as the first thick lava of his spermaceous eruption spurted up within her clinging maw.</p>
   <p>'I-am-sperming you, girl! Do you like it?' he growled.</p>
   <p>'Oh yes, yes, oh yes-give me more-more! Hah! I can feel it all-how thick, how warm, how creamy-MORE! Oh my goodness, I want it now!'</p>
   <p>Quivering, shuddering and making small animal noises, the pair came together, spouting and sprinkling in fervent unison until the last drops were expended and Vanessa could feel a little trickling down inside her thighs. Disdaining all the while the Vicar's attempts to kiss her, she finally felt his thick slug withdraw from her spermy nest, the knob brushing the pouting lips before it fell away. For an infinitesimal moment Vanessa clasped the cleric's shoulders and dug her nails into them, but then she urged him back from her.</p>
   <p>'That, I believe, you enjoyed, my dear', said the Vicar with undue pride while his slackening penis drooped its head.</p>
   <p>'There was pleasure', Vanessa replied more briefly than he would have wished and, with a sigh, began to ruffle down her dress, conscious that she could now find pleasure on the pricks of three males already if she included Hugh in the count. Thus her first meeting with Margaret a week later, when Vanessa was officially invited to take tea, proved more potentially profitable for the latter than the former. Present at table, though not for overlong, was Mr. Eric Partridge himself who to his surprise-since he had abjured amourous activities for some time-found the magnetic gaze, the lustrous lips and the challenging bosom of Vanessa unduly interesting, much as he tried to conceal that from himself.</p>
   <p>No woman needs to be told when she has attracted the eyes of a man and Margaret was by no means displeased at the stray glances Eric bestowed upon their new aquaintance.</p>
   <p>Whatever might divert him could but be to her profit, she thought, though Vanessa had the curious advantage of knowing as much as she. The fact that Reggie was a local schoolmaster added to the outward interest in the conversation, particularly as Vanessa wished to learn what her hostess's particular bents were.</p>
   <p>'There are some very pretty young girls at the school, so I understand', she ventured, bringing from Margaret a vague wave of the hand and the slightly dismissive remark of, 'Oh, girls-yes'. A sudden thought then striking Margaret (all to the same end she had in mind), she asked, 'Does your brother, my dear, also do private tutoring?'</p>
   <p>'No, but I do', responded Vanessa quickly, and not without some truth by then. 'Whom do you have in mind?' she put carefully.</p>
   <p>Margaret did her best to appear uncertain about the matter, for she had as yet not consulted Eric upon it and indeed had only just thought of a way of keeping the girls occupied.</p>
   <p>'Well, perhaps Mabel and-yes-Alice, of course. There are also Huge and Gertie', she added to the hidden amusement of Vanessa who avoided asking her about her nephews, for she discerned the plot quickly enough.-'I shall have to ask my brother-in-law, of course'.</p>
   <p>'Of<emphasis> course. </emphasis>Or-perhaps-would it come better from me, if I may make so bold?'</p>
   <p>'What a splendid idea! Indeed, yes, for you could then both discuss it directly. After all, he will have to be consulted. Mary, will you ask the Master to come down?' Margaret asked, having rung for a maid. Then saying to Vanessa, 'I will leave you to your private discussions, my dear, for such things are not settled in a minute', Margaret bid her adieu and took herself upstairs.</p>
   <p>Five minutes passed before Eric descended, not displeased to find their visitor alone, and thereupon with her sweetest smile Vanessa offered a slightly different gist of the preceding conversations he had had by averring-with some well contrived modesty-that she was seeking a position as a tutor and governess to suitable young ladies. 'Such as I might visit when it was needful', she added.</p>
   <p>'Alice and Mabel? Well, my dear Miss Markham I think that a capital idea! Alice certainly needs tuition in English grammar and goodness knows what else'.</p>
   <p>'And Mabel needs tuition', replied Vanessa, wondering if he were of a cast of mind that might pick up her little message.</p>
   <p>Mr. Partridge's expression did not alter, however, even though Vanessa's eyes passed thoughtfully across his own.</p>
   <p>'I suppose she might, if you wish', said he.</p>
   <p>'I shall teach them both the same things, but in Mabel's case at a slightly more advanced stage', came the words that Vanessa could not resist uttering, for a great mischief was in her now. 'Do you have a stable, may I ask?' she put in as if to change the conversation.</p>
   <p>'Of course. You are in need of a new mount?'</p>
   <p>'A woman always is', Vanessa answered artlessly, 'But no, not that, I was merely wondering whether or not you- what is the word? — have horses, stallions, at stud'.</p>
   <p>This being a seemingly somewhat forward remark for a lady to utter, Mr. Partridge found himself surprised, though withal Vanessa retained a demure, downcast look.</p>
   <p>'Do I offend you? Oh, perhaps I should go', Vanessa fluttered, 'but it was only because…'</p>
   <p>'Yes?' Mr. Partridge leaned forward eagerly, disavowing immediately that which he had actually felt. 'No, my dear Miss Markham, of course you did not offend. You were about to say?'</p>
   <p>'Oh!' With a coy cry Vanessa rose and covered her face, going to the window and turning her back upon him, whereat-telling himself that he felt concerned about her seeming confusion, Eric Partridge got up in turn and went to stand tentatively near to her.</p>
   <p>'Yes? I am sure that you have some matter of interest to unfold', he murmured.</p>
   <p>'Sir, I fear you will think me bold'.</p>
   <p>'I will not, I promise you'.</p>
   <p>With infinite daring, so it seemed to him, Eric placed a comforting hand on Vanessa's arm, this causing her to give him a thankful, shy smile.</p>
   <p>"Well", she uttered doubtfully, 'I had an uncle who believed much in what he called Nature Studies. He had a fine stallion. I suppose one would call it a most vigourous steed. One day, being in my uncle's study for the purposes of education, I perceived in a field beyond a-dare I say? — a stallion with a mare. This caused me to blush, of course. My uncle, perceiving my confusion and seeing the direction of my gaze, emboldened me to continue observing that which he said was a call of Nature. The sight disturbed me much; a sense of moral confusion seized me. Even so his hand comforted me. It really comforted me', Vanessa said with a sigh of apparent reminiscence.</p>
   <p>'Ah, yes', Eric responded with a distinct swallowing noise. Glancing down, he could not help but observe the exquisite <emphasis>rondeurs </emphasis>of the young woman's bottom which mirrored in part the thrusting of her bosom.-'Do you, er, believe that- er-Mabel…? Well, perhaps. I mean, I am not sure. Nature Studies, you say?'</p>
   <p>His voice sounded strange even to himself.</p>
   <p>'Such were they called, yes', Vanessa replied, feeling a fingertip touch her bulbing cheeks and making no motion to impede its uncertain progress as it passed from one half of her bottom to the other.</p>
   <p>'I have a stallion', Eric uttered hoarsely, 'And if you feel, Miss Markham, that it would be advantageous… Well, that is to say…'</p>
   <p>'I do', Vanessa replied softly, pushing her derriere out to the finger which had now been joined by a companion. Together they swept under the deeper curve of her lustrous arse which was veiled only by her dress and a chemise. 'But I have myself already received the appropriate tuition, and of course I could scarcely arrange such an educational spectacle without due assistance. No, perhaps it would have been better had I not spoken of it'.</p>
   <p>'Were I to provide such…'</p>
   <p>'That would be different, I suppose. We would be in private, after all. Would we?' Vanessa enquired, turning her face rather close to his. The pink tip of her tongue appeared between even white teeth.</p>
   <p>'Ess… sss… sential', stammered he, 'but there are p… p… preparations, Miss Markham, of a kind…"</p>
   <p>'That I will undertake. Shall we say four o'clock tomorrow? You will be able to observe, Mr. Partridge, how fruitful such lessons can be. I say <emphasis>observe, </emphasis>for it would be a trifle indiscreet to make your presence <emphasis>known </emphasis>to my pupil. Have we an understanding?'</p>
   <p>'I believe we have, Miss Markham'.</p>
   <p>'So do I-and how pleasant for us both. The entire <emphasis>feeling of it, </emphasis>I mean', Vanessa smiled, reaching behind her giving his fingers an encouraging little squeeze before removing them.</p>
   <p>And thus, with a few further exchanges was a most unusual arrangement entered into, and one which Eric Partridge did not wholly believe in until it occurred, though the thought was enervating, to say the least and caused the maid who attended on Vanessa's departure to observe that the Master had a remarkable cockstand under his trousers.</p>

    <p>Chapter Eleven</p>

   <p>'Up her bottom first. That's where she ought to have it first', Mary opined when Vanessa told her what had passed.</p>
   <p>'Do you think so?' Vanessa asked doubtfully, and still wondered at the fact that she could defer to this unlettered younger girl.</p>
   <p>'Well, I had it like that. It's mastering, you see. There's two kinds of Riding Master, ma'am: one as teaches you to ride an 'orse and the other wot first rides you and gets his prick up your bum. Well-it's rude to say it, I know, but that's true. A girl should be first taken from the back. They say that if you are started off that way, it's best. It teaches you sub… sub something, I was told'.</p>
   <p>'Submission, Mary, yes'.</p>
   <p>'Not that we believe in that now with men, do we?' Mary asked doggedly.</p>
   <p>'Well, perhaps no-but sometimes, sometimes Mary. I believe you to be right, though. In this instance, at the least I would not counsel it for every girl', Vanessa said with utter seriousness.</p>
   <p>'Well, no, nor would I', averred Mary who saw advantage in finally agreeing with her Mistress on everything. 'A nice little furry cunny can take the prick just as well', she added.</p>
   <p>'Yes, dear, of course. But I am only going to give her teasers at first. Still, it will be nice to have a finger up her bottom. She really has a nice plump one, and very firm'.</p>
   <p>'Who you going to put her to?' Mary's question came with an excited little squeak, but Vanessa merely shook her head and said, 'I shall have to see'. It would not do to tell Mary everything.</p>
   <p>Upon her arrival the next day at the Partridge mansion, Vanessa was pleased to find that all save the Master of the house and the elder of his two daughters were absent. This not being a matter she wished to enquire about-though admiring his unexpected resolution-Vanessa took every opportunity in Mabel's bedroom to excite her senses, fondling and kissing her and speaking of the 'delightful episode' in the summerhouse in sparkling tones.</p>
   <p>'Oh, but we should not have done it', declared Mabel in a thoroughly unconvincing manner.</p>
   <p>'To the contrary, my pet, you should frequently do it. Why, goodness me, I am going to give you a Nature Study lesson this afternoon that will quite turn your senses. Come!'</p>
   <p>'But this is Papa's room!' uttered the young girl in bewilderment as she was led therein.</p>
   <p>'We are only going to look out of the window, Mabel, and I wish you to tell me what you see', Vanessa said, taking her thereto where both could kneel up on a cushioned windowseat.</p>
   <p>'Just horses', uttered Mabel in a doubtful tone, but then her expression changed as she saw below one of the stable hands massaging the long, huge penis of the stallion while another held the mare's bridle.</p>
   <p>'Yes, Mabel?' asked Vanessa.</p>
   <p>'Well-oh! — he is…'</p>
   <p>'He is handling the stallion's prick, darling, though it should really be a task for a female. See how he rubs it while it grows ever larger, and how patiently the mare is waiting for her pleasure. In a moment it will be put in her. Now, Mabel, where is the stallion's prick going?'</p>
   <p>'Oh! Oh, I am not sure! It looks like…', said Mabel, pressing her nose to the glass.</p>
   <p>'It may be in her bottom, dear, or in her cunny, for both give equal pleasure. Let me feel yours, Mabel-both of them-please? Mmm, it's so nice, isn't it? What a tight rosehole you have, just like mine', Vanessa murmured having drawn up Mabel's skirt at the back to uncover her gleaming bum and to finger between the ripe cheeks.-'Oh, look, Mabel-it's going right in!'</p>
   <p>Vanessa affected a gasp upon those last words of hers to cover up the feet that her fingertip had invaded the very aperture of which she had spoken.</p>
   <p>'Hooo-wer!' Mabel choked as she experienced the invasion.</p>
   <p>'Yes, it's nice-really nice', came from Vanessa who could feel Mabel's untried bumhole squeezing valiantly around her digit as if trying to expel it. 'Relax, Mabel-this is what our lesson today is about. Can you see it going right up and moving back and forth? Can you?'</p>
   <p>'I f… f… feel funny!' Mabel moaned as Vanessa's digit began to work similarly.</p>
   <p>'Try to be quiet, for you are going to feel nice. Open your legs more, dear. There, that's good. Shall I play with your cunny at the same time? You want me to, don't you?'</p>
   <p>'Dooo-oooh!'</p>
   <p>'Yes, I knew you did, darling. Keep watching, Mabel, for soon enough you are going to have the same, my sweet. There, there-no, don't close your knees, I want them well apart, please! Oh, what a lovely furry pussy. Is it feeling tingly?'</p>
   <p>'Yeh-ehhssss!'</p>
   <p>'And your bottom, dear?'</p>
   <p>'It feels funny!'</p>
   <p>'Nice, though, too? There, you see, my finger goes right up, Mabel, and so does my other one in your cunny, and you're going to come in a minute, aren't you? Tell me that you are'.</p>
   <p>'I…I…I…'</p>
   <p>'Yes, Mabel?'</p>
   <p>'I am g… g… going to come! Goooo!'</p>
   <p>'Work your bottom, darling, work it, I tell you-back and forth. There's a good girl. Oh, don't you do it well! Oh, you clever girl! Wouldn't you like a big prick up you now-wouldn't you?'</p>
   <p>Vanessa's words and actions were too much for the girl whose bottom indeed wriggled visibly while her head drooped on to her companion's shoulder. Incoherent cries came from her as she began to spill her lubricious juices which the dual fingering extracted from her. Moans of pleasure issued from her mouth. Her chin slipped and had to be lifted by Vanessa who then turned Mabel's face so that their lips touched.</p>
   <p>'Tell me, Mabel', Vanessa whispered.</p>
   <p>'I want to', choked Mabel, bubbling saliva against Va-nessa's mouth.</p>
   <p>'Want to <emphasis>what, </emphasis>darling? Tell Vanessa'.</p>
   <p>'Have big prick', moaned the girl and then her tongue slipped into Vanessa's mouth and her breath hissed within and Vanessa felt her cunny-finger being sprayed anew.</p>
   <p>'There's a good girl, now. Lie down and rest and think of nice and naughty things for you are going to have lots of them. Especially what you said you want-big pricks', Vanessa was saying cunningly some time later while a dazed Mabel stirred and rolled on her bed, seeming to hear all but saying nothing. Hearing Vanessa ask, 'You heard what I said, Mabel?' she nodded and murmured something incomprehensible. Her soft warm palm grasped Vanessa's for a moment and then slipped away.</p>
   <p>'Want to', Mabel whispered as if to herself and did not appear to hear her companion's soft departure back to the parental bedroom where a much flushed and excited Mr. Partridge emerged from the adjoining dressing room.</p>
   <p>'You approve of my methods, I trust', Vanessa said before he could speak, then with a laugh she reached down to fondle the swollen crest that was peeping up from an unbuttoned gap in his trousers. 'It would appear that you do, Mr. Partridge. A fine display indeed-but what, pray, are you going to do with it?'</p>
   <p>'My dear Miss Markham', he uttered hoarsely, endeavouring to embrace her, but Vanessa stepped back.</p>
   <p>'You intend it for me, Mr. Partridge? Surely not! There is one here in greater need than I, or will you be so bold as to deny it?'</p>
   <p>'My dear, but she is…'</p>
   <p>'Do you deny it, Mr. Partridge?'</p>
   <p>'Rub it a little more, I beg you!'</p>
   <p>'I asked you, do you deny it? What a bottom she has, has she not? But really, sir, you are throbbing overmuch and I fear a premature spilling. I must take my hand away, I fear. Unless you answer my question, that is.'</p>
   <p>'Yeh-ess! Ah! Oh, my goodness!' gasped he, for therewith Vanessa removed her luring fingers and left his poker standing stiffly up and in full view of her.</p>
   <p>'You have not seen Mabel's lovely bottom before?'</p>
   <p>With a teasing laugh, Vanessa moved away.</p>
   <p>'Why, goodness me, no-of course not!'</p>
   <p>'Of course not? It would seem to me that you, too, are in need of Nature Study lessons. Is the poor girl to remain bereft? Will you not put your poker where she is most in need of it?'</p>
   <p>At that, Mr. Partridge's face appeared so flushed and haggard with desires that Vanessa took pity upon him and once again grasped his rearing member. Thus keeping him anxiously but hopefully secured, she retreated back to the bed, released his pego and threw up her skirts, saying, 'Come!'</p>
   <p>'Ah, yes', croaked Eric who immediately fell upon her and delved his crest into her slit which excitement alone had oiled in readiness.</p>
   <p>'Call me Mabel', murmured Vanessa, straining her back at the delicious sensation.</p>
   <p>'Mmmm… M… Mabel!'</p>
   <p>'Say you are fucking her'.</p>
   <p>'I am f… f… fucking you, Mabel. Ah, my dear, what a lustrous, clinging cunt you have! What a bottom!'</p>
   <p>'Hooo! Do it! Cork me, do it, come in me! Do you want to be so naughty as to put it up my bottom, too?'</p>
   <p>'Do you wish it-do you? AH!'</p>
   <p>'Yes, oh yes, right up between my…oooh! Dear naughty Papa, I can feel you throbbing so much in me- work it faster. I am coming, too-I am'.</p>
   <p>'My treasure, my delight, angel of sweetness! Ah, I cannot hold it back!'</p>
   <p>What lapping of tongues ensued, and what hot wrigglings of Vanessa's bottom as his thick, gruelly jets began! Delighted at the abundance of his effervescent surrender and, realising that he had for long kept himself in purdah and hence would make a useful, if mature, stallion, Vanessa slewed her sucking cunny back and forth along his manly tool until she had extracted the last and most feeble pulsings of his sperm.</p>
   <p>Both clung to each other for a long moment of lubricious churnings of their hips until a quiet fell and Mr. Partridge's head fell upon her shoulder. Her neck being tickled by his kisses, she giggled much as she believed Mabel might do. Then, turning her face away from him as if a fit of sudden coyness had overtaken her, she whispered, 'Mabel wants it soon again, Papa'.</p>
   <p>'Yes, my sweet, and you shall have it', came the dreamy reply while he felt his cock still tingling agreeably between the silken walls that clasped it so possessively.</p>
   <p>'Which is how. it shall be', was Vanessa's soft reply, and he having no cause then to think she might be wrong.</p>

    <p>Chapter Twelve</p>
   </title>
   <p>Many were the ripples that spread out from these multifarious happenings, though no one passing through the village-and no traveller staying at the local inn for a night or two-could ever have guessed how such outwardly respectable folk, whether rich or poor, often comported themselves between four walls.</p>
   <p>This is to the good, of course, for Society of whatever rank presents a placid face to the outer world, which is at it should be. Both the sexes are much the same once temptation has taken them in its velvet grasp, though all pretend otherwise and indeed may affect shock when they chance to learn of the foibles of others.</p>
   <p>Even Mrs. Maude Smith, the Vicar's housekeeper, confidante and erstwhile assistant, was not unaffected by the subtle changes that were taking place with Vanessa's own appearance into the limelight. For an entire week the Vicar failed to receive a new girl for 'confirmation', and Mrs. Smith was put to much wondering about this, though womanly instinct prevented her from mentioning the matter direct to him. Some suspicions lingered in her mind about 'that Miss Markham'-though she could not put a finger on them-and this she finally confided to her husband Thomas.</p>
   <p>It was an oddity-or not-that Maude had not done so before, and that Thomas had no inkling of what passed at the Vicarage. Perhaps it was because she had decided that it was her 'little secret' and part and parcel of her wages which she had also not fully declared to her spouse. The Vicar was often wont to slip some coins into her hand after she had assisted him in getting his doughty prick into some squealing young Miss. Real larks, they were-Maude often decided-for as all lubricious females do, she liked to watch it going in and out of a tight-mouthed cunny and to see the varying expressions on the face of a young supplicant while the Vicar's corker steadily brought her on.</p>
   <p>'Ain't done no con-fer-mations for a week?' asked Thomas in a bemused manner, for to him it seemed a matter of little importance. 'Real restless he is, for I believe he likes to tickle up the pretty ones a bit, though don't you dare tell anyone, Thomas Smith, as how I told you that'.</p>
   <p>'Tickle 'em up, eh? Chance would be a fine opportunity', replied Thomas to the surprise of Maude who had always thought him a dry old stick. 'Heard him at, have you- through the door?'</p>
   <p>'Well, it was what I thought I heard. I mean, when a young girl is moaning then she ain't h'exactly saying her prayers, is she? I hopes you don't get up to anything like that when I ain't here'.</p>
   <p>'Me? No', said Thomas who himself already had flick-erings of suspicion-or curiosity, at the very least about his wife-for he had sometimes peeked into her purse and had seen far more than she ever accounted for to him. 'Young girls, eh?' he repeated, partly to annoy her.</p>
   <p>'Don't you ever get into anything like that, Tom, or there'll be ructions, I tell you, if I ever find out'.</p>
   <p>'Ain't nothing to find out', mumbled he, and this in great part true, for such thoughts as he had recently been having about a couple of young field-girls who worked on the same farm as himself had been kept to himself. Right little pranksters they were, he frequently told himself, and after a bit of 'dick', he was sure of that. Besides, if the Vicar could do it why shouldn't he, and if he were to give them two shillings each it might soften them up a bit more.</p>
   <p>Thus ran Thomas's mind-or rather it was spurred on by his wife's remark which in turn had been sparked off by a dull week at the Vicarage and which in him had been the result of Vanessa's visit. And thus the world goes round and round, so that one might often wonder if the action of a Chinaman in far-off Peking might not one day have an effect on what one does oneself. But enough of philosophy, for we must continue the tale.</p>
   <p>It occurred to Thomas that in order to sweeten the two field-girls, he would need what was for him the mighty sum of four shillings, though upon further deliberation he reduced this to a bob each. To take two out of his wife's purse was the matter of a minute. If she noticed their absence, so he cogitated, then she would have to say. If she did not, then it was because he was not supposed to know about them, and that showed something, that did, as he told himself.</p>
   <p>With the coming morning, Thomas felt brighter than he had for a long time and was all impatience until the foreman yelled to all at one o'clock that they might halt their labours for their usual half hour rest. Kate and Milly-the two girls he had an eye on-being close to him (for such he had manoeuvred), he uttered as if to no one, 'I'm going up behind the lambing shed to eat my dinner', and so saying flipped a silvery shilling in the air which Milly saucily leapt forward and caught, looking at him with quite a twinkle in her eye.</p>
   <p>'Rich today, ain't we!' said Kate as the two girls playfully tossed the coin between them.</p>
   <p>'There's some as could be, for I got another in my pocket', Thomas said and turned and ambled up towards the shed where no one else bothered to go.</p>
   <p>'What you mean by that?' called Kate, but was soon after him, as Milly was.</p>
   <p>Craftily enough, Thomas refused to answer until all three of them were out of sight of the other farm-workers. Settling himself down on the grass with his back to the shed, he observed, 'Some as might like a bob, and some as might not'.</p>
   <p>'Why? What 'ave we got to do for it?' asked Milly who was still teasingly clutching the one he had thrown.</p>
   <p>'Ah now, Kate has to find that out, for you's already holding one. I reckon as how she ought to hold another', said Thomas, rudely unbuttoning his rough trousers and producing a ruddy poker to their view.</p>
   <p>'Oooh! That ain't a bob!' giggled Kate.</p>
   <p>'No, my pet, but you gets a bob in exchange for doing what it wants you to do. Come 'ere!' growled Thomas.</p>
   <p>'Don't think I should. No, Milly, stop it! OH!' squealed Kate as her friend suddenly pushed her in the back with such vigour that with another cry Kate fell full on to him and found herself grasping the said member which throbbed like an engine in her hand. Seizing possession of that which he most desired, Thomas then thrust his hand up her skirts behind and roamed his hand over the girl's glossy, tight bottom before reaching under to cup her quim.</p>
   <p>'In for a penny, in for a bob, Kate-go on!' Milly laughed excitedly.</p>
   <p>'Can't, won't-no!' Kate laughed herself, but Thomas was craftily manoeuvring her all the time, bringing her legs more across his own and holding her by brute force until he had managed to get her left leg on the outside of his right thigh and his poker sticking up under her nest.</p>
   <p>'Put it in her-go on, git down and put it in her', croaked Thomas to Milly who without hesitation fell upon her knees behind the pair and seized his stiff tool, the crest of which she brushed and fumbled under Kate's slit.</p>
   <p>'No, don't-don't, Milly! Tom, you dare! AH! Oh Milly, it's going in-he's pressing me down! Stop it, Tom, it's too…OOOOH!'</p>
   <p>Thomas had her hips, though, by then, and already his pego was up into the entrance to her nest, and Kate hung her head back, gasping.</p>
   <p>The best is not always to be, however, in this world. Unwelcome feet were already approaching the lambing shed, though Thomas and the girls knew it not. Indeed, even the rustling of grass went unheard when their visitor was close to them, for Thomas was enjoying the sweet pangs of ecstasy and Kate herself could not resist slipping down upon his cock, inch by inch while encouraging sounds came from Milly who had often vaguely dreamed of seeing such a thing.</p>
   <p>The voice that broke upon them then, however, was akin to a roll of thunder.</p>
   <p>'Thomas Smith!' it proclaimed, and coming from one no less than his wife almost caused him to ejaculate.</p>
   <p>Kate and Milly shrieked simultaneously, as girls are wont to do. Fortunately for such modesty as she had left, Kate's skirt then enveloped the conjunction of her parts with those of Thomas, though not their separation, for she unsheathed him so rapidly that both her cunny and his prick were to be seen in the lifting of her leg.</p>
   <p>'Thomas Smith!' screamed Maude, as if she had only just discovered his name, and the two girls scuttling off then with all the speed of startled deer.</p>
   <p>'Eh, what, yes, oh!' Thomas choked all in one breath and scrambled to his feet while endeavouring at the same time-though too late-to conceal his poker.</p>
   <p>'You come with me-I got something to say to you', Maude said menacingly.</p>
   <p>Now, if a woman 'has something to say' it is likely to take a long time indeed, and Thomas found that so as he was led off across the field, utterly bewildered at the untoward appearance of his wife in the most unexpected place and at a most unexpected time. Truth to tell, however, Maude had arrived at the Vicarage to find the cleric poorly and in bed, and with his newly-arrived sister looking after him.</p>
   <p>Mildred, the Vicar's sister, was not one whom Maude Smith had ever taken to. In Maude's eyes she was stuffy, dull and a bit of a snob, and the Vicar was always quiet when she was around. Hence, after some hours work, Maude had announced that she had to go home for something or other, for the presence of Mildred loomed large over the household and quite flustered and irritated Maude who thereupon had taken a short cut across the farm of her husband's employment where the foreman had advised her of his resting place.</p>
   <p>Thus it was that Thomas had been discovered-if not also uncovered-and received a fierce, ear-burning lecture for it which lasted until they reached the road. Indeed, it would have continued for much longer had Maude's harangue not been interrupted in full-flight by the chance arrival of Vanessa.</p>
   <p>"Why, Mrs. Smith, how nice to see you', beamed Va-nessa, reining in her pony and curious as to why the lady was not at her post.</p>
   <p>Finding herself having to change mood quickly, Maude replied rather awkwardly at first while Thomas looked abashed, if not also eager to feast his eyes on this goodlooking charmer-and grateful, too, for the intervention. Such being Vanessa's newly gathered powers of persuasion, the two found themselves quickly on board and in course of being transported to their modest cottage.</p>
   <p>Maude was somewhat a-flutter that such a lady should perform a courtesy of this sort, but Vanessa-chatting away brightly-soon dispelled both Maude's risen temper and Thomas's sense of discomfort, the latter saying upon arrival, 'I'd invite you in, Miss, for a cup of tea, but it's such a poor place'.</p>
   <p>'Oh, but I like such small residences. What charming honeysuckle you have at the front here, and that trellis is so pretty', responded Vanessa so disarmingly that she soon enough was within, whereupon Thomas gratefully took himself out of the way, leaving the two to talk.</p>
   <p>Once she felt more settled, and what with Vanessa making such nice remarks about her little home, Maude became more confidential in her remarks, and to a point whereat she confessed to the reason for her temporary absence from the Vicarage. Nodding and clucking her tongue, Vanessa showed all sympathy with her and indeed so led Maude on that Thomas's misdeeds also spilled out a little, too.</p>
   <p>'My dear, I can see that you have many trials and tribulations at the moment. I sympathise with you entirely as to the presence of the Vicar's sister, for such ladies frequently put one out. As to men, well we ladies all know about <emphasis>them, </emphasis>do we not?' preclaimed Vanessa to the awed delight of Maude who found herself seemingly elevated to the same rank as her grand visitor.</p>
   <p>'One does not know what to do with them, Miss, and that's a fact'.</p>
   <p>'Oh, I think I know what may be done, Maude. There are not only young ladies who are in need of care and attention, but men who also require some seeing-to. My belief is that ladies better gather strength when they are in agreement as to such. By the sound of it, and for your peace of mind, Thomas must be brought to heel. Without delay, that is. I shall require your agreement in the matter'.</p>
   <p>'Whatever you say, Miss', Maude responded, being quite overcome by the sudden appearance of purpose which Va-nessa brought into her voice.</p>
   <p>In consequence, a quite remarkable scene followed which would have amused and astounded a Peeping Tom, for he of the same Christian name was then called down to find himself confronted not simply by an angry wife but two determined-looking females.</p>
   <p>'Stand here, Mr. Smith', Vanessa commanded briskly, pointing to a whitewashed wall where a little space had been cleared.</p>
   <p>Maude meanwhile stood with folded arms and planted a baleful eye on her husband who with great astonishment heard that he was to unfasten his trousers and push them down 'for the lady'.</p>
   <p>Such stammering protestations as Thomas uttered then went unheeded. If he had 'never heard the like of it before', he did now, and in the most uncertain tones so that within the following two minutes his trousers did descend and his shirt was delicately lifted by Maude who performed the action with a remarkable display of 'gentility' in the circumstances while Vanessa stood back and studied Thomas's equipment.</p>
   <p>'Did you sperm the girl?' Vanessa asked, much as if she were a lady magistrate.</p>
   <p>'M… Miss, no, I didn't. I swear on…'</p>
   <p>'You need swear on nothing. We shall soon see. A man of your age, however vigourous you may be in your actual performances, is slow to recover. Hold the back of his hair with one hand, Maude, and with the other bring his pecker up, and we shall see'.</p>
   <p>'Yes, Miss', replied Maude, and to a strangled 'AAARGH!' from Thomas began roughly to handle his then pendant tool until in short order it rose majestically and displayed itself boldly and with swollen crest.</p>
   <p>'It would appear that he speaks the truth in this one matter at least, Maude. Very well, have him covered up. I have seen enough. A useful if unimpressive object', said Vanessa languidly, and this to the dismay of Thomas who had always (like most men) considered that he had 'rather a good one'.</p>
   <p>His dismissal on hiding his erection was then abrupt. Maude giggled upon his departure and said, 'I didn't know what you were a-going to do, Miss, but that's taught him a lesson proper, that has'.</p>
   <p>'It is you, my dear, with whom I am more concerned. In the presence of a lady who brooks no refusals, males may frequently be dealt with in this way. You have a son-in-law, I believe, who is laggard in his duties to your daughter'.</p>
   <p>'Well, Miss, I has, yes', Maude said, wondering how on earth Vanessa could have discovered such a thing.</p>
   <p>'I see. Is he well-armed? Have you tried him out yourself? You should have done, you know'.</p>
   <p>'I didn't think, Miss, and besides it didn't seem proper', Maude replied quaintly enough.</p>
   <p>'It is not a matter of propriety, Maude, but of the usefulness of a male. You would not buy a horse that was lame? Of course you would not. Have him come here this evening, and your daughter, too. I will make my appearance here at eight o'clock. It will be close upon dusk then. A delightful hour, I always think. And give no worry to your position at the Vicarage. I will make it my business to call there now and say that you are indisposed. It is time that you had a rest, I am sure'.</p>
   <p>'I don't know what to say, Miss, I'm that confounded by your kindnesses. Eight o'clock, you say, but what's to do when you come?'</p>
   <p>'Why, we shall follow our procedures with your husband to a further point, though to your greater benefit. The young man will be put through his paces. It is time that he covered you, Maude-gave you the grand salute'.</p>
   <p>'Oh, Miss, I don't know as what Elsie would say to that!'</p>
   <p>'Can she but benefit from it, Maude? Not only will she see his true prowess, but will be able to berate him thereafter for having succumbed to my whims. She will become the mistress of his affairs. Being split between her own charms and yours, he will in future be most easily handled. Your husband thereby will be humbled, too'.</p>

    <p>Chapter Thirteen</p>
   </title>
   <p>Elsie Smith was of a physical conformation that could be matched by any of five thousand girls in England. In a word, there was nothing about her that did not please the eye. Her hair was long, for she had tired of clipping it herself, and so let it flow down her back. Her titties were smallish and pumpkin-shaped, being very firm to the palms as the vigourous Vicar had already discovered. Being slim, her waist was of an exceedingly small compass which yielded much pleasure to the eyes when her naked charms were exposed, for the slight swelling of her hips made her bottom seem just delightfully larger than it really was.</p>
   <p>Four summers had already passed since Elsie had yielded her pearly sprinklings to the steady urging of the Vicar's cock. A year later, when she was seventeen, he had induced her to offer her nether cheeks to his manly tool while kneeling on the couch in his study. Elsie had suffered some discomfort during that first attempt, but having been anxiously adjured by her mother not to make a fuss, she had finally taken the whole of his corker up into her bottomhole.</p>
   <p>On that occasion, Elsie vividly remembered that her Mama had peeped-if but for a second-upon the scene. With the Vicar's hand clamped around her mouth as he entered his pego deep between her pert bottom cheeks, her tongue between his fingers and her eyes somewhat bulging, Elsie had-for a split moment-met the eyes of her mother as Maude peeped through the door and then hastily withdrew, seemingly thankful that her daughter was being 'ac-comodated'.</p>
   <p>In part, Elsie still resented that, for she held to the old-fashioned theory that one should enjoy one's pleasures (however doubtful at first) in private.</p>
   <p>Vanessa had already gathered from Mary that many girls were like this and thus-without ever having met Elsie- she judged her to be similar. In fact it could be said that from various indiscretions that had dropped from Maude's lips, Vanessa had taken in the entire situation and perceived quickly enough how she might amuse herself with such outwardly 'ordinary' country folk. Thereby she would also gather more experience and hence drew on her gloves that evening with great certainty of having the strength of mind to do so.</p>
   <p>Having a far-reaching mind, Vanessa also saw this occasion as a rehearsal for such as she might attempt on higher levels of Society, the trick being in this immediate case that whereas Mabel's aunt was a lady fit for sport, Maude would have to prove herself to be.</p>
   <p>Armed with two bottles of fine port which she felt would help to set the ball a-rolling (a pun that she did not mentally miss, though putting it into the plural), Vanessa arrived punctually to be greeted at the front door in hushed whispers by Maude that she 'had got 'em here'.</p>
   <p>'Good, we must talk a little then', Vanessa said.</p>
   <p>As has been mentioned, she found herself then over the threshold and immediately within the living room, or the parlour, as common parlance has it, and was there introduced to an intrigued and wondering Elsie and her gawping husband, Alfred.</p>
   <p>'Drink up, my dears, I wish first to talk to the mistress of the house', Vanessa announced to the great pride of Maude who had never been called such before. 'Uncork the bottles, Alfred, and pour', Vanessa threw over her shoulder while then closeting herself with Maude in the small lobby that intervened between the parlour and the kitchen and from which a short and narrow flight of stairs led to the two bedrooms above.</p>
   <p>'Thomas?' asked Vanessa in a whisper.</p>
   <p>'Pushed him upstairs, Miss, and told him to keep out of the way'.</p>
   <p>'Wise, Maude, but not the best way to humble him. You will permit me? Wait a minute'.</p>
   <p>And with that Vanessa tripped up the worn but sturdy stairs whereat to the mystification and curiosity of Maude came certain mumblings from above which endured for some minutes before Vanessa descended.</p>
   <p>'What's to do, Miss?'</p>
   <p>'He is under instruction, Maude. Have you not sometimes wished at the Vicarage that you could ordain and direct matters as you wished? Of course you have. Hereafter you may practise your own sports, and with the advantage of one or two girls I may send you. First you must prove yourself to me, however, and in the way we have already agreed. Up your skirts now and tuck them up. You have no drawers on, I take it, have you? No. Good!'</p>
   <p>'Oh, Miss, no-I can't in front of Elsie', flustered Maude now that the moment had come, her bottom and thighs already having been hesitantly uncovered. Vanessa herself saw to the bundling and tucking-up of Maude's skirts in a manner that would not allow them easily to fall.</p>
   <p>'I want to see you suck every drop of sperm out of Alfred's cock, my dear, and for that I shall accord you two sovereigns for your pains'.</p>
   <p>'Well, Miss, I don't know', Maude mumbled, trying to hang back in the confined space.</p>
   <p>'Three, then, but that is my limit. Perform, Maude, and hereafter you shall be able to direct your own performers. In with you, please!'</p>
   <p>'Miss!' squeaked Maude at the abrupt opening of the door into the parlour whereat Elsie let out a shriek and Alfred's over-eager glass wobbled in his hand. The rude vision of his mother-in-law's plump thighs, broad belly and dark, thick thatch coming suddenly upon him for the first time, he felt a guilty if crudely-excited stirring in his loins.</p>
   <p>'Mum?' gasped Elsie whose utterance was totally ignored.</p>
   <p>'Stand against the wall, Maude, please, for I have you on show', directed Vanessa. 'Alfred, put down your glass and lower your trousers, please. This INSTANT!'</p>
   <p>'Alf, you dare!', came from Elsie.</p>
   <p>'Girl, be quiet! You are under my instructions for your mutual benefit. Alfred, you are not obeying!'</p>
   <p>'Ar, but she might not like it, Miss!'</p>
   <p>'Your mother-in-law has not seen it yet, you dolt, so how can she say whether she does or not? Let us see your apparatus, sir!' Vanessa snapped while a flush-faced Maude's knees bent a little and she pressed her ample bottom against the whitewashed wall.</p>
   <p>'Tell him, Maude, or all is lost', hissed Vanessa dramatically into Maude's ear, whereat came a dry-mouthed utterance from that lady of, 'Yes, Alf, do as she says'.</p>
   <p>'Oh, Mum!' wailed Elsie again at that, whereupon Vanessa turned sharply around and brought her gloved hand to slap against the girl's right cheek.</p>
   <p>'I said QUIET, and I mean QUIET!'</p>
   <p>'Oh-wer!' wobbled Elsie and watched unbelievingly as her husband of less than a year uncovered that which was as rude a sight as any such parlour might see-to wit an extremely distended penis and two balls the size of tangerines.</p>
   <p>'Well, Maude, what is your opinion of your son-in-law's poker? Does Elsie have much to complain of?'</p>
   <p>'Not…' (a gulp from Maude), 'not much, I s'pose, no'.</p>
   <p>'Excellent. I am in agreement with you. Advance to the table, Maude and put your bottom up. It is a regulation posture in high places. You would do well to ape your betters in such matters. Come-have no hesitation-no more than does a cow when brought to the bull. Let us see what you have to offer to this noble cock. Legs spread, please, and held steady. Ah, there is my teaser! How prettily you show it, Maude! The finest bottom in the parish, surely! Do you not think so, Alfred, now that it has materialised from out of your dreams? Get behind her, you oaf, and present yourself. Enter the knob in her succulence, but no more than that. Hold so and you may be duly rewarded. Shall I reward him, Maude?'</p>
   <p>'Dunno, Miss… I… oooh! Ooooh, Alf!'</p>
   <p>'There, you see, he is accommodated. How he quivers to enjoy you! Do not let it sink in as yet, Alfred, or I shall have cause to whip you', Vanessa declared, thereupon producing a crop from under the cloak. 'Stand up, Elsie, and come closer and you will see how the mighty engine is expected to perform. See how the veins stand out-give me your hand, silly, and do not look so much like a wet lettuce, please-see how the eager knob halts at the very portals of desire'.</p>
   <p>'Miss, I don't think we ought to do anything like this… WHOOO!' Elsie gasped as Vanessa ringed her waist and thrust her free hand up beneath her attire to find a bottom that was admirably well-rounded, warm as toast, and naked as well.</p>
   <p>'Oh, gawd, Miss, let me!' croaked Alfred.</p>
   <p>'In two inches, then, I concede that. A gentleman ploughs slowly and steadily, Alfred, and does not rush his fences. Is that not true, Elsie?' Vanessa asked cunningly, fingering in-between the girl's tight nether cheeks and causing her hips to wriggle and her legs to twist.</p>
   <p>'I dunno, Miss, I… HOOO! Yes!'</p>
   <p>'A better answer, girl, for I warrant you know well. Alfred, your patience is commendable, as is that of your mare. Thrust your prick up her fully now and hold!'</p>
   <p>A low moan of pleasure came from both amourous contestants as Alfred obeyed and brought the bulging, naked cheeks of Maude's bottom to spread right across his belly. In so being entered, his mother-in-law's cunt had seemed to expand, much like a flower opening and so inviting his now greasy rod to enclose itself completely in her maw. Once she had received the doughty masterpiece of pulsing flesh, Maude clasped upon it and around it, the walls of her cunny forming a tight sheath in a manner that caused her son-in-law to feel dizzy with delight. Both snorted as Maude pressed her bumcheeks into him demandingly.</p>
   <p>'Oh lawks, Mum!' whined Elsie, wriggling herself as Va-nessa's fingers attended to her own queasy honeypot.</p>
   <p>'She is but exercising the male, Elsie, as you must equally learn to do. Very well, Alfred, commence pistoning your rod but be not hasty in the matter. Withhold your fervent juices as yet or I shall crop you, my lad. Slow out-slow in. It is the female that must obtain the pleasure when you are covering her'.</p>
   <p>'HAAAR!' both Maude and Alf groaned and grimaced as the fleshy tube commenced its movements back and forth, for though there were many words that the lady used to him which he did not understand, Alf caught the drift of it all right and was happier than he had deemed himself to be in ploughing his mother-in-law's tight and succulent furrow.</p>
   <p>As for Maude, the whitening of her knuckles where she gripped the sides of the plain deal table and held her stockinged legs taut against the libertine assault showed that Alfred was already causing her the greatest pleasure.</p>
   <p>Vanessa had meanwhile tipped up the front of Elsie's skirt and, standing but feet from the hard-breathing contestants, cupped the girl's plump young pussy with one hand, inserting her finger up between the lovelips, while toying with her well-ridged bumhole with the other.</p>
   <p>Her eyes half-dimmed, Elsie swayed. She could see and hear all that it seemed to her impossible to be happening. At every thrust of Alfred's loins, her mother's fat bottom cheeks smacked into his belly just as her own had often enough smacked into the Vicar's. And perhaps then again Elsie remembered that her dear Mama had once peeped in on that.</p>
   <p>'You are not coming, Alfred, I trust?' came Vanessa's cool voice.</p>
   <p>'Goooo! N… no, Miss, I'm trying me hardest. Not if you don't say'.</p>
   <p>'It's nice, isn't it, Maude, nice?' asked Vanessa encouragingly.</p>
   <p>'Yes, Miss-yes, Miss-ooooh!'</p>
   <p>'The world is made for pleasure, Elsie', sighed Vanessa, pressing her lips upon the girl's in a manner that the half-swooning Elsie could no longer resist. In that moment, there was only one world for Vanessa. Her eyes closed, her tongue slithered wetly around Elsie's while her fingers worked more feverishly, causing the slim girl to droop with desire. Tapered fingers that were sticky from Elsie's honeypot soothed the sweet moisture momentarily over the girl's silky belly and then returned to their task, making Elsie's breath hiss into Vanessa's mouth.</p>
   <p>'Are you ready for it, my pet?' husked Vanessa dreamily while Elsie's hips squirmed.</p>
   <p>'Haaar, yes, oh yes!'</p>
   <p>With that passionate little response, Elsie did not see the door open, nor hear the footfalls of the naked Thomas whose penis was quivering up towards the ceiling. To his view first came the sight of Alfred's steadily-working buttocks, his spread legs half concealing the sturdy, stockinged ones of Maude who had by now spent twice and was about to do so again, her effusions sprinkling and spurting over Alfred's sensitive knob. As a voluptuous accompaniment to this lusty display, Thomas also viewed the exquisite <emphasis>rondeur </emphasis>of Elsie's bottom and her plump and oily cunny that nestled like a bird in Vanessa's palm.</p>
   <p>Vanessa had told him upon what 'cue' he was to make his entrance, though mischievously enough she had not told him what he was to do thereupon.</p>
   <p>Elsie's eyes half opened in that moment and she viewed him, though dimly, as if she were seeing a ghost. There was nothing apparition-like, however, about the distended penis she could see, nor the hefty balls that hung in waiting below it.</p>
   <p>'Pa-pa-har-haaar!' came Elsie's moan and her knees buckled the more as then she herself spurted her fine rain over Vanessa's cunningly-tickling finger while a pink mist seemed to further blur her vision.</p>
   <p>'Over, Elsie!' Vanessa murmured, and guided the half-swooning maiden to the opposite end of the table so that, in being bent over it, Elsie faced her Mama, with their noses all but touching.</p>
   <p>'Oh gawd!' Thomas husked in delight. In the past he had had several fine peeps at Elsie's apple-round bottom when she had flitted about wearing naught but a petticoat, and his fingers had ofttimes tingled to taste those prettily-bulbing cheeks.</p>
   <p>With Elsie's new posture, he could view in totality the chubby halfmoons, the sweet crevice that divided them, and the nesting of curls around her slit.</p>
   <p>Hearing Vanessa's hurried whisper of 'To your post, man!' and therewith a more wavering cry of, 'No, Dad, you can't!' Thomas saw to it that he could. Straddling his well-muscled legs behind those of Elsie, he suffered no warnings from a fascinated Vanessa as his swollen crest slewed up between the pouting lips and made its new home fully, deep between the satiny walls.</p>
   <p>'Mum-mum!' Elsie sobbed.</p>
   <p>'Hold hands, girls. Put yours over hers, Maude. Clasp them. Good! Not too quickly, Thomas, please now. Give her a good sturdy fuck. It need not be the last she will receive from you if you perform well'.</p>
   <p>And with that-truth to tell-Vanessa began a slow backward movement towards the door. The gasps, the sighs, the breathless, incoherent murmurs from the two females as the males attended upon them-the utter certainty that all would now finish the course-filled Vanessa with immense pride. It would be pleasant, thought she, to witness the four of them in the dizzying aftermath, to know what was said and what passed-to know what further impassioned caresses they might enter into. But even so, such would take up too much of her time, and she could learn later from Maude what transpired. The thought of the sovereigns she was due to receive would hang over Maude as closely as would this voluptuous and perhaps overdue event.</p>
   <p>Hence, raising the latch and quietly opening the door that led into the gathering night, Vanessa took one last lingering look at the fully-occupied quartet. Elsie had surrendered-haplessly, perhaps, but nobly, too.</p>
   <p>'Can't help…!' she was moaning to a dazed and excited Maude whose fingers were interlocked with her own. Elsie wriggled adorably to every commanding stroke of the parental penis, which was thick, meaty and already glistening from the first eager little 'shower' she had afforded it, her polished bumcheeks rubbing amourously against Thomas's stomach.</p>
   <p>Alfred would surely come now, and Thomas would come too soon, Vanessa thought, but such could not be helped in the first fervours of desire. There would be time again for more. There surely would.</p>

    <p>Chapter Fourteen</p>
   </title>
   <p>The fever that was upon the Rev. Jubstone was a light one, albeit that it brought many strange fancies and fantasies into his mind. He had heard that Miss Markham had visited briefly, which had evidently been in order to relay a message that Mrs. Smith was poorly and could not attend upon him.</p>
   <p>It might be-pondered he-that his housekeeper had fallen foul of the same sickness as he. On the other hand, a faint suspicion entered his mind that the hand of Vanessa was intrusive in this matter, though to what purpose he knew not.</p>
   <p>Fever attends upon men differently, and in Percival's case it caused him to erect even more frequently than he was normally wont to do. He hoped that Mildred had not noticed it tenting up the bedclothes on her frequent visits to his room, bearing a hot-toddy or the like.</p>
   <p>On the other hand, however, he equally hoped that she might, for he was curious as to what her reaction might be. Four years younger than himself, Mildred was a widow of considerably firm and protuberant charms over which he had not seldom cast a wandering eye. Now that he was abed, she had cause to lean over him often, and it was frequently with great difficulty that he prevented himself from fondling her mammalian beauties as they hovered close to his face or shoulder.</p>
   <p>On the occasion of such further circlings in his mind as those of which we have spoken, he failed to control his errant hand and, in receiving a cup of tea from Mildred, allowed his knuckles to brush the nipple which was concealed firstly by her brown dress and, beneath that, by her chemise.</p>
   <p>At the touch-accidental as she conceived it to be Mildred flushed and said that she had left the kettle on the hob, this causing her to retreat with a distinct tingling in her bosom and while leaving Percival in fear that she might be offended.</p>
   <p>To the contrary, however, Mildred was strangely disturbed and blamed herself muchly for being so. Her brother she conceived to be the most upright of men and feared that latterly the nudgings of the devil were ever at her elbow. Modest and quiet in all her ways, there were yet stirrings in her loins that occasionally brought a sheen of frustration and self-reproach into her eyes. Reaching the kitchen and standing alone upon the cool, stoneflagged floor, Mildred leaned against the door and fretted mournfully at her wicked thoughts. She must remarry, she told herself, but just as quickly cast the thought away, for such unions frequently brought complications such as she did not wish to entangle her life with.</p>
   <p>That single touch on her breast was the first such she had received in years, and so sensitive was her bosom that she had even felt a slight tingling in her belly as well.</p>
   <p>'Oh, Percy!' she made to call out in desperation, there being no one else to whom she could appeal for aid and comfort-someone to solace and guide her into the paths of righteous thought, as she put it to herself. Her weight being heavy against the door, Mildred did not at first feel the light push upon it, but then started at the mention of her name and stepped forward-much flushed with guilt and anxiety-as her brother entered.</p>
   <p>What instinct caused him to appear at that point is unknown. Perhaps it was but a passing motion of thought through his mind, or mayhaps that the single, furtive caress he had afforded Mildred had produced emotions that were stronger than his fever.</p>
   <p>At his entrance, Mildred turned to the table and there leaned against it, so hastily producing a small handkerchief from within her bodice that the Vicar could not fail to see her state of distress, asking, 'What ails you, my dear?'</p>
   <p>'Percy, oh Percy, I am in a state of sin! And why are you not abed? You should be abed'.</p>
   <p>'It may be that we both should be, my dear', replied he solemnly and not without hope, for such signal as he was giving showed rigidly through his nightgown. Though being utterly concerned with her own thoughts, Mildred curiously failed to observe the projection and only heard him asking in return, 'What state of sin are you in, my dear? Confess to me, for surely I have the right to hear you first'.</p>
   <p>'But it is so terrible! Oh, Percy, if only you knew!'</p>
   <p>'It is of the mind or of the body, Mildred?'</p>
   <p>'My thoughts, my thoughts!' she uttered hysterically.</p>
   <p>'Tush, Mildred. What are thoughts save passing fancies through the mind? You are overwrought and tired withal, perhaps. I have been a burden to you, that I know'.</p>
   <p>'No, Percy, you have not-never!'</p>
   <p>Unthinkingly, Mildred then cast herself a few feet forward and embraced him, thus bringing her belly to touch against the stave that burned beneath the cotton covering. And, fearful that at its discovery she might draw away, Percy cast his arms about her waist and held her closer into him, savouring the thrusting of her large breasts to his chest.</p>
   <p>'I, too, have sinned, Mildred, both in mind and body. Are we not kin? May we not speak freely in four walls of such? Even now-isolated and lonely as I am-the veritable beauty of your form pressed against mine…'</p>
   <p>'No, Percy, stop! We know not what we say!' uttered Mildred whose consciousness of the throbbing of his erect tool against her could no longer be concealed even from herself. 'Let me go! Pray let me go!' she sobbed, and with that tore herself from his arms and fled, leaving the kitchen door to bang upon its latch.</p>
   <p>Many had been the tearful rebuffs that the Vicar had received during his lusty lifetime, but none worried him more than did this present one, for to offend his sister in such wise seemed even to him rather more awesome than it would have done with any proud lady of Society who might otherwise have yielded to his whims.</p>
   <p>With Mildred's flight up the stairs, a heavy silence hung upon the Vicarage, this producing from him a huge sigh and the need to reach for his whisky bottle. His fever was passing, he assured himself, though that in his rigid pego had not abated. The devil of it-if only Mrs. Smith were here and some nubile nymph waiting to be brought in for anointing of her cunny or her bottomhole with his fond juice.</p>
   <p>Seating himself at his desk, Percival pondered many things, though mainly the pleasures he had lent himself to in that very room. Thus half an hour passed-and then another- and still the silence prevailed, so that finally he betook himself upstairs and knocked gently upon Mildred's door.</p>
   <p>'Go away, Percy', came the broken reply, though not larded with anger but with self-reproach, he was glad to note.</p>
   <p>'I will fetch you tea, my dear, or a hot-toddy, or whatever you may wish'.</p>
   <p>'No, my dear, for none can help me now, and least of all you'.</p>
   <p>For a moment or two this doleful conversation ensued before Percy uttered a deep sigh which he devotedly hoped could be heard through the door, wherewith he betook himself to his room and his ruffled bed and gazed moodily out of the window, preventing himself from humming as he was often wont to do.</p>
   <p>Some time passed during which Mildred sighed and turned and turned again upon her bed. Faint sounds coming to Percy's ears, he waited impatiently and nervously as to what might be about to be said. Finally he heard the quiet opening of Mildred's door, followed by her footsteps down the stairs again. Undecided as to how to put himself about, but having grown exceedingly tired of staying in his bedroom, he cast off his nightshirt and donned only a shirt, trousers and a pair of socks.</p>
   <p>The silence had fallen again. There was an air of waiting about it-ominous, perhaps, but he could not tell. Mildred would be wearing her outdoor clothes, ready to depart, her valise packed. He increasingly felt sure of it upon his own descent. Soft-footed as he was, he entered the drawing room soundlessly and halted in surprise at what he saw.</p>
   <p>Mildred sat attired in a purple retiring robe of silk. Slippers hung from her feet as if they were not sure whether they were to be on or off Where the lower part of the front folds of the robe almost covered her thighs, he caught a glimpse of a stocking top and the creamy surface of a lustrous thigh. There, a betraying glimpse of white lace showed that she might be wearing a petticoat, yet heart-beatingly Percy realised from the close sheathing of the rest of her outer garment that she could be wearing little else beneath.</p>
   <p>Bowed forward and with her face cupped in her hands, her hair unpinned, Mildred remained motionless upon her brother's entry and did not seem to be aware of his passage across the room where he took a seat facing her. Only the creaking of his chair disturbed the quiet and an air of solemnity was all about.</p>
   <p>'It is a pleasant evening, my dear', he began, clearing his throat, 'Are you… that is to say, retiring early?'</p>
   <p>For a moment he thought that no reply was forthcoming from her. Then Mildred slowly raised her face and he saw to his dismay that tears had streaked her cheeks. Her legs shifted slightly, making her robe to draw apart and reveal-ingly, thrillingly and disturbingly to his eyes the junction of her thighs where the drooping loop of a petticoat-as he more clearly saw it now to be-just covered her bushy thatch.</p>
   <p>Seemingly careless of what she was displaying, her eyes dimmed as if by her thoughts, Mildred asked in a dull tone, 'Percy, pray tell me, for my mind goes all about the matter. What is sin?'</p>
   <p>His penis having regained its bold posture of uprightness, the Vicar uncrossed his legs slowly, giving no hindrance to her own view of the massive projection in his trousers, his armchair being but a few feet from her own.</p>
   <p>'It is that, my dear, which most curiously gives the greatest pleasure. Therefore we should not always avoid it, for to do so would be to lack experience of all that is about us', he replied unctuously.</p>
   <p>A flush invaded Mildred's cheeks at that. She appeared breathless, her bulbous breasts rising and falling under their thin covering which betrayed the peaking of her nipples to his ever more blatantly seeking eyes. Their glances meeting, they appeared for a moment as if bemused and neither knowing what to say.</p>
   <p>'It is so quiet here-so nicely quiet', Mildred murmured as if aimlessly.</p>
   <p>'There is no one to disturb, my dear-no ears to hear, no eyes to see', ventured her brother in lulling tones.</p>
   <p>'No one to see, no'.</p>
   <p>Mildred's head hung back. A ripple of nervousness seemed to pass through her thighs, making them assume a posture of greater laxness. His penis thrumming, Percy watched the loop of petticoat slip a little to one side. The edge of it glided and hung between her lovelips, one rolled, pouting side of it he clearly saw. Temples pulsing, he rose, feeling a curious trembling that had never invaded him with his young novices, nor even with Vanessa.</p>
   <p>'Desire is not sin, Mildred', he offered thickly while her gaze appeared to fix itself on his knob which so clearly outlined itself through the cloth of his black trousers.</p>
   <p>'Oh, Percy! Oh Percy, you must cane me first-cane me!' Mildred uttered with a sob, covering her face again.</p>
   <p>So astonishing was her cry that her brother halted in midstep. Then, with unaccustomed tenderness he placed his hand upon the top of her bowed head.</p>
   <p>'I shall cane you first, Mildred. Yes, of course. Of course I shall. Remove your robe, my dearest, while I fetch the instrument'.</p>
   <p>'Percy!'</p>
   <p>Her cry, nigh unto one of despair, followed the Vicar as he swiftly ascended to his study where, strangely sick with excitement, he fumbled out his whippiest cane, slender as a woman's little finger and with a slight bend to it. He had last used it, he recalled, on Arabella Smythson-Hyde who, at twenty-two, had submitted upon the tenth stroke to the first burrowing of a prick between her marbled bottom cheeks.</p>
   <p>Mildred was standing on his re-entry, hands to her mouth, her robe floating apart to reveal the slumbrous, voluptuous curves he had so long wished to see. A woman of just above medium height, Mildred possessed still a fine pair of legs that were neither too thin nor fat. And he could see her garters now, the purple of the ruffled silk around the pale beige of her stocking tops-could see the valley in-between her luscious tits which the top of her petticoat but half concealed, could see her nipples sprouting through the white batiste.</p>
   <p>'Percy, I cannot!' came her whimper while her fingers clenched and unclenched and her gaze was fixed upon the rather threadbare carpet in the room.</p>
   <p>'I am here but to exorcise your sins, my love-to rid your mind of vagrant wanderings. You know-I know-that I must scorch your bottom first. Remove your robe and place yourself in readiness over the sofa back. I will attend to you. If there is to be sin between us, let it not be cloaked in that hypocrisy which smears the minds of others. We are not as they. Present your arse to me, my love-your fine and bulbous arse my hands have often longed to touch. Come to the cane now, Mildred-come!</p>
   <p>'Haaar!' Mildred gasped as with those words her brother grasped her wrist and in several floundering steps on her part took her to the waiting sofa back and pressed her over it. Then, throwing up her robe and petticoat, he tucked them briskly underneath her arms to let her tits hang free, and then stepped back.</p>
   <p>'If we two are in sin, Mildred, then let our words evoke that which we mean to do. Straighten your legs and hold them well apart. Present your bottom, well thrust out- present it to me as a sister should'.</p>
   <p>'Per-cy!' Her shoulders and head being then hid from him, her hair flowing out upon the cushions of the seat, Mildred made as if to rise again, but the rippling movement in her back was sufficient warning for her brother who had so frequently encountered such recalcitrance before.</p>
   <p>Swooo-issssh! the cane sang, biting deep across both bottom cheeks and leaving there a thin pink streak that brought a howl from Mildred and a wailing cry of 'No!' such as the Vicar was well accustomed to. Giving her no respite, he brought another up beneath her magnificently bulging bum that made her lift clear up on to her toes and more clearly display the rolled lips of her cunt to him.</p>
   <p>'Har! Percy, stop! I cannot, cannot bear it, no!'</p>
   <p>Hooo-witt! A third, much deeper streak that bit into those plump, full cheeks and caused her hips to roll and writhe.</p>
   <p>'It is needful, my dear, to bring you to the cock. I know that now. Three more, my pet, and then my entry will be made. A good creaming of your cunt is long overdue, I think. Is that not so?'</p>
   <p>'No, Percy! Oh, do not speak so! How can you? Ah, no! Aaaaargh!'</p>
   <p>And indeed the cry that rang from Mildred's throat was by far her shrillest, for Percy had afforded her a sharp, swift double, coursing the cane from left to right across her quivering, cleft globe and then reversing its passage, causing Mildred's bumcheeks to contract visibly as her screech reached its thinnest, highest note.</p>
   <p>'Hooo-waaah!' sobbed Mildred but a few seconds later. Omitting the final stroke in a paroxysm of excitement and casting down the cane, Percy had seized her swelling hips and nosed the crest of his charger up between the oiled lips of her slit. Frequently in this posture he would first hold himself half in until the most frantic wrigglings had been conquered and the throbbing of his tool conveyed the message to the supplicant.</p>
   <p>In this instance, however, he burrowed fully in with one sleek stroke and brought Mildred's scorched bumcheeks to rear into his belly while, bending full over her, he took purchase of her jutting tits with both his palms and wallowed in the succulence of her close-gripping slit.</p>
   <p>'Percy-hee-heee!' Mildred blathered, rolling her bottom wildly for a moment while he nested powerfully within her.</p>
   <p>'What an arse you have, what tits, what glorious thighs! Come, my sweet, keep your legs well straddled-let us be in sin and fuck!'</p>
   <p>'Oh, Percy, hooo! Oh, it's in-it's in!'</p>
   <p>'Be quiet, my dear!', thundered Percy, straining his strong legs blissfully as the spongy walls of her nest enclosed him grippingly, but at the same time recovering himself. For, as had been seen with Vanessa, it was in his nature to evoke total obedience from a new female, and in the present sense his mewing sister was undoubtedly new to him.</p>
   <p>'Oh-wow!' Mildred whimpered, but to his relief subsided into gasps and uttered no more words the while that his thick, long pestle began to work her.</p>
   <p>Never before, perhaps, had the Vicar had a more vi-gourous fuck, for he sensed it was needful to so 'service' Mildred thoroughly in this first incestuous bout to which both had been slowly and hesitantly drawn. The sensation of her ripe bottom cheeks slapping into him with every inward stroke was glorious. Levering himself up anew, he stood with straddled legs and back upright while his loins impelled his pulsing pego back and forth in her foaming slit. Indeed, several times he glanced down to see with excited wonder its self-renewing entries and to watch as well as to feel the bumpings of her fine arse into him.</p>
   <p>Both grunted, both breathed heavily-both emitted little moans. A soft sluicing sound was to be heard in the otherwise quiet drawing room, together with a slight creaking of the sofa-back at every throbbing thrust. And such small sounds-devoid of intervening voices-were as music to the Vicar's ears.</p>
   <p>Even so, after several minutes of this lubricious exercise, and upon feeling himself about to explode his spermaceous offering, the Vicar asked pantingly, 'Have you come, Mildred?'</p>
   <p>'Hoooo, Percy!'</p>
   <p>'Have you, Mildred-have you?'</p>
   <p>'Yes!'</p>
   <p>'Good, my sweet, then let us see if we can come, and come rejoicingly together, for I am about to fill your cunt at last.'</p>
   <p>'P… P… P!' came stutteringly from Mildred who was in truth shamefully lost to all but desire.</p>
   <p>'Work your arse, for I shall fuck you frequently hereafter, Mildred'.</p>
   <p>A low cry broke from Mildred, for the very crudity of his utterance stirred her to an even madder excitement. Sprinkling ardently, she at the same time felt the first inward rush of a long, thick stream of sperm from her brother's prick inundating the clinging interior of her cunt. Her bottom squirmed wildly in delighted response.</p>
   <p>'Oh, Percy, yes-more! More!'</p>
   <p>'What a superb fuck you are, Mildred. We should long ago have done this. My heavens, how much I am shooting up you… aaaaah!'</p>
   <p>With that heartfelt cry, the Vicar spurted and jetted on, laving her sleek, interior walls with his juices until with flaring nostrils and quivering legs he uttered up his last and remained with his pulsing shaft buried full in her, gritting his teeth in delight as Mildred remained now passively responsive to his will.</p>

   <title>
    <p>Chapter Fifteen</p>
   </title>
   <p>'There were no objections, then? Oh, I am glad of that', Margaret murmured. Relaxed in a cane chair upon the lawn, her face protected from the afternoon glare by a pretty sunshade of pink with a deep, white frill, she turned her face towards Vanessa as she spoke.</p>
   <p>'None. In fact it might be said that I am giving every encouragement to advance the girls. In such ways as I think fit, that is. The boys will be neglected. That is the shame of it. Unless… but then of course you do not have time'.</p>
   <p>'Time? Unless? What is your intention, my dear?'</p>
   <p>Thus asked Margaret who felt a pleasant fluttering of anticipation in her as she spoke, for it seemed to her that Vanessa was offering her the very opportunity she desired.</p>
   <p>'Why, Margaret-may I call you that? — were you to have time to educate the boys in such a manner as I think best fit for them, what pleasure you would incur in so teaching that which is so seldom taught! A comely woman-one so fine in aspect as youself-would surely know much joy, much fulfilment of the spirit, in being attended to by three rapidly-growing young males who in all respects will thus broaden their education immensely, and with such due homage as I believe they should devote to you. What a lovely mouth you have! Do you mind my saying that?'</p>
   <p>'What a strange way of talking you have! I have never met the like! What… what <emphasis>manner </emphasis>of education do you think I should give them?'</p>
   <p>'Have I not said? That which approaches most closely to the heart of pleasure. Writing, reading, or arithmetic? Why no, for anyone can teach that. There are more <emphasis>seminal </emphasis>matters which require to be disclosed to them. Do you understand, Margaret?'</p>
   <p>'A little, but I am not sure'.</p>
   <p>As sure as your tongue now passes quickly across your lips are you sure, Vanessa thought to herself, but allowed no expression of revealment to enter her face.</p>
   <p>'How delicately can I put it, Margaret? Young men are frequently to be found making solitary offerings to Venus, and that I deem a great waste, do you not? They should not be left to languish thus. How cruel! A good female teacher will best decide for them when and how such votive offerings-liquid and warm in form-may best be expended, for they are bound to be and will otherwise be wasted on the empty air. Did not the Bard say, 'Gather ye rosebuds while ye may?' and may we not gather other than such? Indeed, we may more fruitfully do so, for it is never in and out of season, is perpetual in its rising, virile and responsive to one's will'.</p>
   <p>'Really! How you make me blush!' responded Margaret, doing nothing of the sort.</p>
   <p>'Insofar as your dear brother-in-law and nieces have no interest in such matters, you will be denying no one else that which you should rightly receive'</p>
   <p>'Sh… should I? Do you think?'</p>
   <p>Margaret's voice quavered but her eyes were filled with hope.</p>
   <p>'I have a great admiration for you, Margaret. I shall protect your secrecy, your privacy. The girls will be in my care, the boys in yours. That which is not spoken of need not be known about'.</p>
   <p>'Yes, but Hughie…'</p>
   <p>'I make no exceptions, my dear; why should you? Is he to be left to languish? Would you really have it so? Would your conscience not <emphasis>prick </emphasis>you?'</p>
   <p>'P… prick?' answered Margaret involuntarily, since the word was very close to her heart.</p>
   <p>'Precisely, dear. I will guard you from interruptions- provided of course that you let me know when your schoolings are to be. Otherwise I shall be helpless to assist and heaven knows what might befall. Tomorrow morning, shall we say, at eleven? I would love to assist sometimes, you know'.</p>
   <p>'But…!'</p>
   <p>The faint squeak that emanated from Margaret was lost in the balmy air as, with that, Vanessa rose quickly and swept, skirt rustling, into the house. One must know when to arrive and when to depart in Vanessa's new-found philosophy, and besides, she had something quite important to do and had Mabel waiting in her room.</p>
   <p>Before attending on her pupil, however, Vanessa retired to a guest room that had been allotted to her for her 'rest periods' and there girded herself with an object that many English ladies would have deemed curious and shocking in the extreme, but which some lovely Parisiennes would have deemed a necessity.</p>
   <p>Reggie it was who had been despatched to London to obtain it, he protesting much that he would never dare seek or ask for such a thing. As was ever the case now, however, he had been given no leeway in the matter and had returned after two days with a foolish and wondering grin on his face that he had succeeded in purchasing the same in the purlieus of the City's Holywell Street which lies close (as some may know) to Kingsway and the east end of the Strand.</p>
   <p>It was quite perfect, Vanessa thought, fondling it and then lowering her dress. Entering Mabel's room, she found the slightly apprehensive but also equally excited maiden awaiting her entry and her teachings.</p>
   <p>'You are enjoying yourself, Mabel, in my care?' Vanessa asked, locking the door.</p>
   <p>Mabel swallowed and nodded. Recalling what she had been told to do by her new tutor, she had already removed her dress and underclothes and wore but a wrap, her sole coverings being a pair of pink silk stockings and pretty black bootees, the both of which items were new.</p>
   <p>A perfect thrill of excitement went through Vanessa as the flushed Mabel rose and stood uncertainly, hands limp by her sides. The young woman's eyes feasted on the girl's curves which the semi-transparent folds revealed even to the dark and admirably thick fuzz of curls below her belly.</p>
   <p>Her breasts, fully-rounded and well-lifted, displayed through the gauze the brown nipples that seemed to so appeal for a kiss, a touch, that Vanessa immediately threw one arm around the desirous maiden and slipped her hand among the folds until her fingers were able to cup and fondle the resilient titties in turn, this causing Mabel to sigh and rest her cheek upon Vanessa's shoulder.</p>
   <p>'Why, you beauty, how well I am going to have you fucked', murmured Vanessa, 'You know that now, do you not?'</p>
   <p>Her face suffused, Mabel nodded. Her tits being exquisitely sensitive, they swelled to the first lingering touches of those tapering fingers which floated over the peaked crests until Mabel scarcely felt able to breathe.</p>
   <p>'It can be anyone you wish, my dear, but at first it must be someone in the household. We do not want strangers, interventions, discoveries, do we?'</p>
   <p>So speaking, Vanessa cast the filmy robe from Mabel's shoulders so that it floated to the ground, leaving her like a young Venus arising from the foam of the crumpled garment. And therewith also, Vanessa knelt, running her hands down the insides of the girl's thighs in order to open them. This Mabel did awkwardly, shuffling her feet uneasily as her stockinged limbs were made to form a wide vee. The skin inside of the tops of her thighs was deliciously warm and silky and Vanessa kissed the pearly surfaces, causing Mabel to quiver in anticipation.</p>
   <p>'Good girl-show in equal measure both timidity and eagerness to obey, as you are now doing'.</p>
   <p>'Oooh-wah!' came involuntarily from Mabel then, for with her tongue protruding fully, Vanessa swirled the tip up between the rolled lips of the maiden's honeypot in one long sweep that brought a heady scent to her, compounded of saltiness and muskiness. Hissing softly through her nostrils as the lower part of her belly curved into Vanessa's nose, Mabel endeavoured valiantly to speak.-'But, Miss, in the house there are only…'</p>
   <p>'Be quiet, Mabel, for it shall be thus and must be thus. Another lick? Would you like another long lick?'</p>
   <p>'Hooo! Yes!'</p>
   <p>'Naughtiness becomes you, Mabel. You will learn to stick your bottom out to whomever I deem to be cock-worthy of your magnificent bottom and your lovely cunt. You see, you are becoming juicy already at the very thought of it'.</p>
   <p>'Hmmmmmm!' Mabel hummed, for Vanessa's tongue was now lapping her slowly and rhythmically, each sweep concluding with a lingering venture around the bud of her clitoris which had perked up just like a small penis. The oiliness exuding from her cunny increased and therewith Vanessa's hand reached around to part the plump, springy cheeks of Mabel's pert derriere and hold them so as widely as she could.-'Gloooo!' Mabel choked. Her legs were wobbling already and Vanessa knew by many tiny signs that the girl was already on heat and ready to ejaculate her sprinkling pearls, but she wished as yet to keep her on the brink, and now was the moment when a girl was most malleable.</p>
   <p>Giving one long final swirl and twirl of her salty tongue, Vanessa rose quickly, planted her fuming lips on Mabel's open ones, caressed her hard-nippled titties anew and said briskly, 'On the bed, my darling, as I have taught you-on hands and knees, bottom up and back well dipped. Legs apart, Miss! Offer up!'</p>
   <p>Swaying and floundering, Mabel obeyed, causing the bedsprings to tinkle as she turned and so positioned herself until Vanessa could see both her pinky-brown bumhole and the plump showing of her curl-shrouded quim.</p>
   <p>'Thus, dear, good-an excellent posture-STAY!' commanded Vanessa, running one hand tenderly over the lush areas of Mabel's bottom and feeling under to her pulsing slit. So stroking and feeling, Vanessa kept her thus for a full two minutes, sometimes questing a hand under Mabel's pendant tits while the girl's splendidly-curved hips wriggled impatiently.</p>
   <p>'It may be Hugh the first time, Mabel. Would you like that? No, dear, do not lift your head. Just tell me', Vanessa uttered, running a teasing finger around the puckered rim of Mabel's nether aperture.</p>
   <p>'D… d… don't mind', Mabel mumbled.</p>
   <p>'Quietness is essential, darling, at the first. The young female is put to the male, as you soon shall be. His cock may furrow between the cheeks of your adorable-quite adorable! — bottom, or may plough slowly up inside your delicious cunny. You may moan, you may wriggle, you may even utter a gasp or two, but I want no loud cries from you or I shall immediately bring you under the cane and then let him work you. In due course, Mabel, you will yourself seduce the male, but it is under my tutelage at first that your cunny and your bottom must be thoroughly worked until you are completely receptive to receiving the male stem and its glorious juices. It will lodge itself very slowly at first, Mabel, I do promise you. Like this. Be still now. Bottom poised, please!'</p>
   <p>'Oooh!' Mabel gasped incautiously (albeit not too loudly), for at that Vanessa mounted immediately behind her and, throwing up her skirts, displayed that which Reggie had brought back from London in a small valise-to wit, a dildo.</p>
   <p>Such are often said to be of a 'monstrous' size, and indeed many a lady can accept such in her eager maw. Having some sensitivity in the matter, however, Vanessa had so instructed her brother that the imitation, velvet-covered penis which pronged up from her belly (being, of course, held by broad straps) was of moderate girth-indeed almost thin-nish-and some nine inches in length. The head thereof was perfectly formed of gutta-percha, as was the stem, and had been moulded with loving care to resemble the real object as perfectly as possible.</p>
   <p>Upon feeling the probing crest at her already love-moistened bumhole, Mabel squeaked, but a cautioning hand passed lightly over her mouth and there remained, if not smothering then quietening the burbling sounds that were emitted from between her pretty lips as the invader made its careful path upwards between her bulbous cheeks.</p>
   <p>'Pmfffff! Nooo!' Mabel whimpered, this bringing from Vanessa-who had by then already smoothly entered some three inches into the narrow channel-a coaxing but stern,</p>
   <p>'Yes, Mabel! Push your bottom back now gently. Come, girl, you are taking it'.</p>
   <p>As Vanessa well expected her to, Mabel endeavoured to shake her head, for the sensation of something going up where normally something only came out was strange in the extreme. Its entry made her feel breathless. Small snorting sounds came from her which Vanessa thoroughly enjoyed for she felt as if she were breaking in a young filly- as was indeed the case. Having had Mary operate the dildo with her, Vanessa now knew precisely how it felt and how important each little movement of the invader was on its first excursion between virgin bumcheeks.</p>
   <p>'Now, darling, you are taking cock', Vanessa husked. Gripping the fronts of Mabel's thighs, she slewed the dildo slowly within, half inch by half inch, until with a gurgling cry from the girl it was fully entered and Mabel's hot bum came to bulge into her teacher's belly.-'There, dear, there, keep still now; the sensations will fill you with exquisite pleasure in a moment-and in a moment I want you to ease your hips forward so that the prick comes halfway out and then to push back again until you have it once more right up you'.</p>
   <p>'It hurts me!' whimpered Mabel, her forehead nesting upon her pillow.</p>
   <p>'It does nothing of the sort, Mabel. It is simply a new feeling', responded Vanessa, affording the buried shaft a small movement back and forth, this bringing a soft gasp of surprise from Mabel that so much could accommodate itself up her lovely bottom.-'Show willing now, Mabel. Turn your neck and offer me your tongue, my sweet', said Vanessa bending full over her and keeping the dildo buried to the full.</p>
   <p>'Oooh-woooh!' gurgled Mabel as she obeyed, but it was a baby-sound and already intimated that a little pleasure was stealing into her. Her pussy was literally bubbling and ready to spurt and her bottom cheeks felt open as they never had before. Palming her breasts passionately, Vanessa absorbed the girl's tongue and sucked upon it lasciviously while their warm breaths flowed together.</p>
   <p>'You are being buggered-sodomised, dear-is it not nice? Does it not make your lovely bottom feel tingly and nice? There! Ah! Good girl, you are moving it a little! Oh, splendid, yes', moaned Vanessa against Mabel's pulpy lips while their tongues swirled and the girl's stiff nipples protruded between Vanessa's fingers.</p>
   <p>Her head swimming, Mabel spurted deliriously over the palm which now couched itself under her pulsing nest. Broken murmurs of delight issued from her. The sleek velvet of the outer sheath of the dildo now worked her more easily. Her bottomhole stung just a little-a faint, peppery feeling-but it was nice, nicer… oh, nicer.</p>
   <p>'You will have your first sperming tonight, Mabel. Like this, like this', Vanessa uttered chokily. It was really too soon, too soon, but Mabel was spurting, sprinkling in abundance again-a salty rain upon Vanessa's fingers-and the moment could not be riper. Reaching back under herself, Vanessa squeezed the two large, imitation testicles that already held the warm milk she had filled them with.</p>
   <p>'Zeee-eeee!' gasped Mabel then, feeling a warm, thick spurting into her-indeed so deeply into her that it seemed to fill the whole of her tummy. And then came another and another and as Vanessa came upright again and shafted her vigourously so another flood came and Mabel's head moved in small circles of delight and wonder over her pillow, her face sheened with moisture and the love-ridged lips of her fucking-pot emitting more of her essences.</p>
   <p>Murmuring softly to herself, Vanessa came in turn and then rammed the dildo right up between Mabel's chubby cheeks and squirted the last of the milk.</p>
   <p>'Whooof!' came from Mabel and therewith almost an hysterical giggle which spoke volumes for the pleasure she had sustained. Unyielding, the stiff pego long remained in her until her last squirmings had ceased. As it finally sucked out, leaving the rosehole of her bottom pouting open, so both sighed and collapsed and Mabel cuddled herself into Vanessa's arms.</p>
   <p>'You will be obedient henceforth, Mabel'.</p>
   <p>'Yeth' was that maiden's shy, whispered reply. Their lips met softly and Vanessa stroked her face.</p>
   <p>In every way, she thought, Mabel might yet prove to be a model pupil.</p>

    <p>Chapter Sixteen</p>
   </title>
   <p>'What's they like really, the Smiths?' Mary asked Va-nessa the next morning.</p>
   <p>'Useful, Mary. That is the best word for them. I have decided to accommodate them here. That is why Reggie departed early-to take a message that I wish to see them. Upon their settling in, my dear, you will have a new status. I do not mind in the least if you call yourself their govern-ness, for such you will be. I believe the events of the night will find them still in rut. They are malleable now and will be useful to us in many respects. Between them the two females will keep the house sparkling. As for Reggie, I grow a little wearisome of our games with him. He may be put to the women occasionally. As for yourself, Mary, both the males are well furnished and will do your bidding. If necessary-should there be alarms of any sort-their fealty will ensure that they act as our protectors. Such people are always defensive of their positions in life. They have need to be', Vanessa uttered a little coldly.</p>
   <p>'Yes' Mary said while still puzzling several of the words her Mistress had used. 'When you says they're <emphasis>mallable</emphasis>- was it <emphasis>mallable?</emphasis> — do you mean they're dippy, Miss?'-this bringing a laugh from Vanessa.</p>
   <p>'Dippy? Why no, Mary, not at all. I mean that they may be used. Used, dear. I have others to use. You can amuse yourself.</p>
   <p>'But they might not obey me, Miss'.</p>
   <p>'They will obey you, Mary, because I tell them to. Ah, here they are, I think. Let them ring a few times and then let them in. It will do them no harm to wait', Vanessa ordained while Mary straightened her ever-crooked cap which she had ceased to wear except when dusting or for the occasion of visitors.</p>
   <p>Maude Smith was the first to enter, as Vanessa had suspected. The others shuffled uneasily in the hall.</p>
   <p>'Your money, my dear Maude', Vanessa said, anticipating her so quickly that Mrs. Smith's hand was filled with coins even before she realised she had extended it, and this taking the wind from her sails.</p>
   <p>'What we done last night was wrong, Miss', Maude mumbled, squeezing her fingers around the gathered sovereigns. Gathering confidence, she leaned forward a little and whispered, 'He had her again after that. On the floor, he did- had her again'.</p>
   <p>'I expect you were all lying down by then, anyway. As to yourself, did you have a restful night?' Vanessa asked distantly, gazing over the woman's shoulder rather than into her face.</p>
   <p>'Went upstairs. Tried to have a sleep. Then Alf come up. I told him no, but he was a-lumbering all over me, and they was a-going at it downstairs again by then. Couldn't face this morning, I couldn't'.</p>
   <p>'Are you not speaking?'</p>
   <p>'I think she's been telling me lies about him, about her Alf, Miss. He goes at it proper. No holding him back'.</p>
   <p>'So, you had him up between your legs twice, my dear, and took pleasure from it. What harm in that? There is a saying, Maude, that one should not kick against the pricks, you know', Vanessa said with conscious humour that was wasted on Mrs. Smith who seemed to require time to chew that over, asking with a doubtful look, 'Is there, Miss?'</p>
   <p>'Just as there is at the Vicarage. But you do not want to return there, surely? I have much more homely accommodation for you. So far from you having to pay rent for your cottage, you will all make your home here free, and with wages such as we will settle between us, you and I. Put aside your foolish ideas, Maude. After all, you never entertained such at the Vicarage, nor were you yourself entertained much, I believe. Here it will be otherwise. I like watching, Maude, just as you have so often done, but now you also have the pleasure of doing it, too'.</p>
   <p>'You mean… you mean like doing it with both of them still?'</p>
   <p>'You know very well that I mean that, Maude, and do not pretend that you are displeased thereby. You are in your most vigourous years, my dear. Bring up their erections; make them spout'.</p>
   <p>'And Elsie, too, I suppose; that's what you mean?' asked Maude in a would-be sullen tone.</p>
   <p>Vanessa turned away from her, showing her back, and gazing out through the leaded panes of the drawing room window.</p>
   <p>'Whatever passes, my dear, he will have her over again and she will yield, her expression mayhap a little startled ever, her eyes wide, but her sweet bottom ever wriggling. You know it well'.</p>
   <p>'Reckons as I do, yes. I'd have to be ever watchful, I would. Get my nerves on edge, it would'.</p>
   <p>'You can relax now, my dear Maude. Have them come in', Vanessa uttered grandly.</p>
   <p>With the entrance of her three, as she thought of them, Maude stepped back as if she were not part of the immediate assembly-a gesture which did not displease Vanessa who waved her to a chair. Maude proudly sat and, upon a thought, slipped her well-won sovereigns silently into her purse. Standing between her father and husband, Elsie's eyes faltered and fell, but Vanessa stepped forward and tilted up the girl's chin.</p>
   <p>'Elsie, how nice of you to come', she cooed, 'I have come to an agreement with your Mama that you will all stay here now, and well rewarded you will all be, I can tell you'. Then, as if embracing all three with her words, Vanessa went on, 'In an unpleasant world there are many disagreements; in a pleasant one such as will encompass you here, there will be naught but agreements. Is that not so, Maude?'</p>
   <p>'Why-er-yes, Miss, that it is-that's right'.</p>
   <p>'Elsie, you will have your own little boudoir, as will your Mama. You may conduct yourself in comfort, given your obedience-or shall we say your compliance?'</p>
   <p>'My, my what, Miss?' stammered Elsie, going pink.</p>
   <p>'Actions speak louder than words', Vanessa replied, ringing the bell for Mary who endeavoured to come in looking impressive but in actuality looked hushed.-'Mary is the governess of the house and in my absence you will follow her wishes. I said five shillings a week for each of you, did I not, as wages, Maude?"</p>
   <p>'That you did, Miss', replied Mrs. Smith who had never heard of such a high sum being paid before except to head butlers and the like. Thomas bit his lip, half grinned, but remained silent as did Alfred who seemed feared to even move his feet.</p>
   <p>'Precisely. Mary, pray conduct Elsie to her room and have her disrobe. One of the males will attend on her immediately. Thomas, I think. Wait in the hall, Thomas, and Mary will call you up'.</p>
   <p>'But I don't want…!' Elsie uttered in a wail and cast a beseeching look over her shoulder at her mother who appeared absorbed in the apparent weight of her purse or else the colour of the curtains.</p>
   <p>'Come on', Mary said with such abruptness that it surprised and pleased her. Taking Elsie's elbow, she turned her about and led her out.</p>
   <p>'Oh, no!'</p>
   <p>Elsie's cry echoed in the hall. A dragging of feet sounded which took Vanessa immediately to the threshold of the door.</p>
   <p>'Cane her, Mary, if she does not perform properly and well!'</p>
   <p>'Yes, Miss, I shall'.</p>
   <p>'Ow! You dare!' came Elsie's wail while with an imperious gesture from Vanessa, Thomas began to take himself in the hall. It were a right turn-up, he thought, and maybe even a dream, but he wasn't sure. His brain felt fuddled but his cock was already getting stiff. She had a lovely little bum, did Elsie, but it were funny doing it like this and Maude knowing about it again, like she had done last night.</p>
   <p>Vanessa left the door ajar, waiting. Mary was as much a test as any of them.</p>
   <p>'Take your clothes off, Alfred, and stand against the wall', she ordained without looking at him, adding-as if en passant-'Maude, see to it that he does', her words being followed by a squealing 'Yeee-ow!' from Elsie and the snapping voice of Mary saying, 'I said, get it off, Miss, and your petticoat as well'.</p>
   <p>'It seems that she can deal with things, Maude', Vanessa said, holding the door and glimpsing a wondering Thomas biting his lip in the hall.-'Are you progressing?' she asked, hearing a thump of boots.</p>
   <p>'It's all right, Miss', said Maude between tightened lips, which was precisely the mood that Vanessa wished her to be in. An idea had struck her-a very amusing idea. Deliberately she did not rum her head around the half-opened door of the drawing room to observe a nevertheless heavily-breathing Alfred whose mother-in-law was already handling his cock and balls.</p>
   <p>'Have him lie down, Maude. On his back. Make him obey', Vanessa said crisply and much to the surprise of both. Then it was that she pushed the door to a little and saw the dangling, thickening root of Alfred's cock as he went down oafishly and stared up at the white plaster roses that formed crossed ropes across the surface of the ceiling.-'Sit on him, Maude-skirt up and plump your bottom down on his face. Keep him quiet thus. I want to listen'.</p>
   <p>'Miss?'</p>
   <p>'Do it, Maude. Do not be tiresome. Spread your bottom cheeks over his mouth and nose. You have no drawers on, of course? Good. Let him sniff you thus, my dear, for that will bring his cock up as fast as anything'.</p>
   <p>'Glmmmph!' sounded from Alfred next as with surprising daintiness and not a little curious eagerness, Maude raised her skirts and-kneeling over his chest-brought the rather massive weight of her mature bumcheeks to spread odoriferously over his startled face. Indeed, in that bewildering and darkening moment, Alfred found his nose stuck precisely up to her bumhole while the thick brush of curls around her cunt, together with the rolled lips, scoured his mouth.</p>
   <p>'Nicely, Maude, nicely. Keep him down. Excellent training for him, my dear-excellent', Vanessa observed to Maude who-feeling the most curious and exciting of sensations- squashed her son-in-law's face more firmly under her plump arse. Grinning with pleasure, her face flushed (though not a hundredth part the way that Alfred's was), she looked up at Vanessa who nodded briefly but approvingly, her ears cocked still for the sounds from upstairs.</p>
   <p>"Swooo-wittt! both Vanessa and Maude heard, though whether Alfred did is problematical.</p>
   <p>'Geee-ow!' screeched Elsie, and with that Mary's victorious cry, 'I told you so, didn't I? Now, put it up, Miss, or you will get a dozen more! Come on now, let me see it all. Oh, what a lovely cunny! Shall I tickle it?'</p>
   <p>You are going beyond yourself with those last words, Mary, so Vanessa thought, but it was impossible to teach such a one the finer nuances of schooling a girl. Morever, Elsie was simply being awkward. An annoyance-an inconvenience. Alfred was puffing, gasping. His bared toes curled, and were dirty. They must all have daily baths, Vanessa decided. And perhaps, after all, they were not suitable. Mannered gentry had far better ways.</p>
   <p>Opening the door wide upon Thomas whose penis was very clearly prodding up through his rough trousers, Vanessa uttered quietly, 'Go up, Thomas and attend to her. But do not come. I shall accord you five minutes of mutual pleasure, but your emissions are not to be released'.</p>
   <p>'My what, Miss?'</p>
   <p>'Don't <emphasis>come </emphasis>in her, I said. I shall inspect you. Failure to obey me will not be treated lightly, nor will you be permitted within sight or knowledge of Maude or myself to put yourself up to her again. You can understand that, I believe?'</p>
   <p>'Well, Miss… Yes, Miss. But if I ain't allowed the proper course of Nature…'</p>
   <p>'You are not. Elsie is, though, and thus you will accord her a full five minute shafting. Get to it, man, and pleasure her <emphasis>for </emphasis>her bottom will be burning by now and she will douse your prick with certainty. Remember that I shall examine you!' 'All right, Miss, yes. I still gets me wages, though, don't I?</p>
   <p>'Upstairs, Thomas, please. With such delights awaiting you, why do you stand talking of such mundane matters?'</p>
   <p>Consulting her timepiece with deliberation in front of him, Vanessa closed the door and gazed with renewed pleasure into Maude's astonished visage.</p>
   <p>'Oh, he ain't going to do it to her proper, then, Miss?'</p>
   <p>'Very proper, I believe, Maude. Whose is the pleasure that counts-that of the female or the male? The female, of course. Now, please, bring Alfred off with your hand. I want to see him spout'.</p>
   <p>'He comes a lot, Miss. Real thick and a lot'. There was awe and admiration anew in Maude's tone, though directed entirely towards Vanessa.</p>
   <p>Watching dispassionately, Vanessa glimpsed part of Alfred's face as his mother-in-law lifted her hips and, leaning forward, grasped his rigid member and commenced frotting it gently.</p>
   <p>Alfred's cock was creamy-purple, but his face even more so of the latter colour.</p>
   <p>It was to be expected, though. In that moment Vanessa wanted something that was <emphasis>unexpected, </emphasis>and her mind began to work on it even as Elsie's sobbing cry floated down from upstairs of 'Oh, Dad, oooh! Oh, Dad!'</p>

    <p>Chapter Seventeen</p>
   </title>
   <p>How to achieve her object of the 'unexpected' gave Va-nessa an almost sleepless night, producing faintly dark circles under her eyes which gave her face an even more slumberous and voluptuous aspect. Her mind raced here and there down corridors of twilight where figures endlessly moved and danced, spoke, laughed, or whispered to each other in the gloom.</p>
   <p>'There are aspects, Mary. I must seize upon the correct aspect', she murmured thickly to Mary when the maid brought in her morning tea.</p>
   <p>'Yes, Miss, I s'pose one ought to do that', replied the girl, having no idea of what her Mistress might be talking about.</p>
   <p>'The females. I trust you have them in their rooms, their doors locked'.</p>
   <p>'As you ordered, Miss, yes, I done that. Saw to it last night. You said as none of them must do it for a few days now'.</p>
   <p>'A few days, yes, that's right. They must work. I do not want to think about them at the moment, though. I have other things, other things. I may amuse myself with them again, I may; I do not know. Leave me, Mary, for I have much to think about. One must not become mechanical, must one? That is the problem, you know; that is the problem. I begin to perceive it more and more'.</p>
   <p>'Yes, Miss. If you wants anything else', Mary replied doubtfully and drifted out, perhaps wondering if her Mistress was not a little dippy sometimes.</p>
   <p>'Yes!' Mary heard Vanessa declare very loudly as she made to close the door, and looked anxiously back again at her, asking, 'What, Miss, what?'-'Nothing. I have just thought of something, that's all, Mary. Do not concern yourself with it'.</p>
   <p>Some two miles away, at the same hour-in a bed whose sheets were much rucked from the night's activities-the Vicar lovingly palmed the large, glossy, warm bottom that Mildred's dozing posture presented to him. As so often in the mornings, he had awakened cock-proud and with a little start of re-awakening Mildred felt the plumlike crest glide insinuatingly between her nether cheeks.</p>
   <p>In that moment, as the events of the previous evening swam back to her, she reached an arm behind her and, groping for the impudent weapon, clasped the shaft, murmuring, 'Percy, no! We are in sin!'</p>
   <p>'And deliciously so, my dear. Did you not confess such last night when in the very throes of <emphasis>amour?'</emphasis></p>
   <p>So speaking, Percy rolled his sister on her back and made sure of his mount by immediately straddling her and exhibiting the morning glow of his erection to her eyes. Naked as both were from the toils of Venus, Mildred's titties looked particularly large and succulent while her sleep-glazed eyes looked up at that which she had never thought to see-to wit, her brother's fiercely erect penis and heavily-dangling balls which sprouted hairs all around them.</p>
   <p>'S… S… Susan is coming today', she swallowed as one hard knee urged her plump thighs apart.</p>
   <p>'Susan-yes', he responded while remaining kneeling up in a dominant position and with one knee now nudging the furred mound of her slit. It was two years since he had seen his niece, a proud young woman, not wholly unlike Arabella Smythson-Hyde of whom he had the fondest memories.</p>
   <p>'She… she must not know-cannot know', protested Mildred as the Vicar's manly form descended then upon her own.</p>
   <p>Knowing that he would find her cunt receptively moist from sleep-not to say the three lubrications it had received after their first lubricious bout-Percy hesitated not but glided his poker straightaway up within her channel until his swollen receptacles came to rest under the deeper curve of her bottom. There had been moments when he had sensed that Mildred might prove slightly recalcitrant. He was prepared for such even while feeling the delectable squeezing of her vaginal walls around his embedded pego.</p>
   <p>'You will be quiet, Mildred-or do I have to cane you again?' he asked against her mouth the while that his eager throbs announced themselves within her clinging maw.</p>
   <p>'Percy-oh Percy-you would not', grimaced Mildred whose hands clawed at his brawny shoulders.</p>
   <p>'There will be times when it may be necessary, Mildred. 'Twas you who last evening invited me to-nay, implored'.</p>
   <p>'Because… because I knew I was going to be in sin with you, Percy. Oh, I implore you… AAAH!'</p>
   <p>Mildred's gasp arose from a slow ploughing movement of her brother's cock which then momentarily settled itself again deep in her nest.</p>
   <p>'Open your legs, woman! Raise your knees a little! What a tasty slit you have-what opportunities we have wasted these past years, have we not?'</p>
   <p>'Yes, oh yes, I suppose. My head whirls when you d… do it to me, I cannot help myself. Oh but we should not, Percy, should not! HAAAR!'</p>
   <p>'The ride commences, my love. I am your stallion, you my mare. Thrust your hips, work your bottom, Mildred- draw in your brother's sperm again. Come, do it, or I shall thresh your slit again in sight of Susan when she comes. You hear me?'</p>
   <p>'Y… yes, Percy! Oh, Percy, don't speak so wickedly. Ah! F… f… f…!' stammered Mildred as the great fleshy plunger moved with thrilling ease in and out of her oily slit. Their bellies smacked, her big titties jiggled, their nipples so fiercely sucked upon by his greedy lips that both rose to fierce points of fire. Licking his tongue around the burning eminences and cupping her firm bottom possessively, the Vicar continued growling such words at her as Mildred had never thought to hear, yet in the red haze of desire-and in the liquid spurtings he extorted from her-Mildred was as lost as a wanderer might be in unknown, close-knit country lanes.</p>
   <p>'You need cock, Mildred-say it!'</p>
   <p>'Nee… nee… need cock!'</p>
   <p>'And Susan-Susan needs a big, firm cock as well, my love-say it!'</p>
   <p>'No, Percy, no! Hooo! Ah! Oh, faster, faster, for I cannot help myself!'</p>
   <p>'Susan, my sweet. Tell me that Susan, too, needs cock, for surely we both know she does, is over-proud and needs to be put over now and then-but say!'</p>
   <p>'Pmmmfh! Come in me, Percy, come, oh come!'</p>
   <p>'Of Susan what have you to say', growled the Vicar, threshing even faster and feeling his slewing knob delicously assailed by her sprinkling juices. Cupping her bottom even more firmly, he caused his forefinger to ease into the puckered aperture of her rosehole, this bringing Mildred's tongue to leap into his mouth much as a salmon leaps and curves.</p>
   <p>'S… S… Susan… Oh no, Percy! Do not make me utter… utter… HAAAR!'</p>
   <p>'I will cane you, my dear, more thoroughly than I did last eve if I do not have your obedience to my will. Have I not first rights on you? Have I not?'</p>
   <p>'P… Percy, yes! Oh, stop it. No, don't! I want to feel it, feel it come in me-oh do!'</p>
   <p>And indeed Percy was at boiling point, yet had long inured himself to fine control when tutoring young maidens. Only in the first throes of lust had the possibilities that arose from the visit of Susan come into his mind, and now he was both possessed and fired with determination by them.</p>
   <p>'Susan-Susan, Mildred-answer me, or by heavens you will receive no other pleasure but the cane!'</p>
   <p>As he spoke, so Mildred's nails dug the more fiercely into his shoulders, for the orgasmic explosions she was experiencing fired both her mind and body to a pitch she had never attained before. Lewd figures-figures as seen naked through a gauzy curtain-danced before her eyes. The even greater pulsing of her brother's steadily-pistoning prick caused her to lift her legs and wind them hungrily around his waist. His balls smacked steadily into her bottom where, too, his finger was easing suggestively back and forth.</p>
   <p>'Yooo-hooo, yeh-eh-esss, Su… Su… Su… ooooh!'</p>
   <p>'I shall flood both your cunts-your bottoms, too, my sweet', groaned Percy who could not longer hold back from his delight and loosed such a cannonade of boiling sperm within her maw as made her writhe in a red mist of delight until both collapsed and, breathing heavily, went into quietude which, however, was broken after a long reflective minute by Mildred as her brother's slackening slug slipped from her slit.</p>
   <p>'Percy, you did not really mean…'</p>
   <p>'Lie still, Mildred-rest. I will fetch you tea. You are a glorious fuck, my pet, a glorious fuck'. And with that salutation he departed quickly while Mildred lay back and threw an arm across her eyes, her cunny pulsing still, her mind aflame.</p>
   <p>Ten minutes later when Percy re-entered the bedroom, naked still, his thick penis dangling, it was to bear her a cup of tea the like of which-unknown to her-Mildred had never drunk before. Certainly, it was of the finest Indian blend, yet a certain potion had been mixed into it, the faint taste of which two spoonfuls of sugar concealed.</p>
   <p>'Percy… Percy, you said…', Mildred began hesitantly, raising the welcome cup to her lips.</p>
   <p>'I have said nothing that we did not agree upon, my dear. Drink your tea and rest anew. There is no haste to rise. By the time I have fetched Susan from the railway station you will have long been up and about'.</p>
   <p>Mildred's lips quivered as she drank. A score of things to say danced in her mind and yet she knew her weakness in having spoken in the wildness of desire as she had done. As Percy dressed, so she drank and let her head rest back upon her pillow. Indeed, she felt drowsy again already. Perhaps it was the morning warmth. The sound of his movements about the bedroom became fainter. Her eyelids grew heavier and closed. There was darkness, there was darkness, there was dark:</p>
   <p>Percy surveyed her then more closely, tiptoeing to the bed and shaking her shoulder gently, but she did not stir.</p>
   <p>The potion had worked well, as often it had done before with others who had awakened to find themselves in the Vicar's bed. It would be two hours before she stirred at least, and meanwhile there was Susan to attend upon.</p>
   <p>Opening a small cabinet beside the bed, Percy produced a bottle of port, pouring a little onto his fingers and then passing them first across Mildred's lips and then her nipples. The scent thereof was redolent and could not be escaped.</p>
   <p>A devilish plan, he told himself with an inward chuckle. Devilish but not eventually harmful, so he persuaded himself. Susan was ripe for a corking. If he did not give it to her, some churlish fellow would whom she would fruitlessly marry. Better to put her to his own cock for a few weeks at least. There need be no great disharmony between the pair if he treated them correctly, sternly. Women, in his view, took to sternness well, though Susan might be difficult at first-she might.</p>
   <p>And thus would anyone have thought who knew Susan. At twenty-one, she was an inch taller than her Mama and willowy of figure. Her titties were small and high-perched, having fine pointed nipples that would have delighted the errant fingers of many a man or woman had they chanced to invade her corsage-but none as yet had. Nor had her fine bottom been moulded by loving hands, nor her cuntlips parted to enquiring digits. In short, Susan was virginal in all aspects, even to the proud quivering of her nostrils and her stately but cautious walk as if at any moment she might trip over something.</p>
   <p>That his niece had not been cock-tasted was very much in the mind of Percy upon his journeying to the railway station. His urge was to unveil and cane her noble young bottom until she squealed for release thereof on to the waiting prick-an instrument she had almost certainly never seen in full stance. But in this instance, perhaps, there would have to be a different method-one just as forthright in effect, but different. Within a few days she would prove more malleable, in any event. Two well-tutored females about the house, two females of his own class who could be taught many a little trick and eventually assist him in the seduction of young girls, would be more admirable than Mrs. Smith who fortuitously had put in no appearance, anyway.</p>
   <p>Surprise rose in Susan's eyes, so prettily garbed in a white and blue dress as she was, upon alighting from her train and seeing only her uncle waiting.</p>
   <p>'Is Mama not well?', she asked upon their settling in the Vicar's conveyance.</p>
   <p>'She is resting, my dear. A little over-indulgence in port, I fear, but she will soon be herself, I am sure'.</p>
   <p>'Oh!' exclaimed Susan, for she had not been aware of such tippling habits in her Mama and felt a little dumbfounded with embarrassment that scarcely eased when, upon reaching the Vicarage and having discarded her flowered hat and her white, elbow-length gloves, she proceeded upstairs with her uncle in her train, and he observing with much satisfaction and not a little impatience the rolling of her bottom cheeks beneath her tightly inswept skirt.</p>
   <p>The sound that Susan uttered upon entering the boudoir of sin was great indeed, for there lay her fond Mama in utter nudity, one leg hanging over the side of the bed and all of her plump, firm charms displayed to view.</p>
   <p>'She, she, she is uncovered! Oh, Mama, Mama!' Susan cried, shaking her parent and endeavouring in vain to cover her with the sheet which the crafty cleric had seen to it was well twisted and tucked beneath Mildred's legs which, in slumber, were heavy. Her bewilderment was of course even greater that such a shameful display could be made and hence she tugged ail the more until Percy ringed her waist and drew her upright in such wise that her bottom moulded firmly into his loins.</p>
   <p>'Do not upset yourself, my dear, nor disturb her as yet, for she will awaken in her own time. Besides, you must be weary after your journey. Come, take your ease with me for a while in the drawing room. She will call us as soon as she awakes. The port, I fear… You see how the bottle is nigh empty'.</p>
   <p>'Oh, poor Mama!' Susan uttered with a little sob, but seeing no help for it allowed herself to be led downstairs with his arm comfortingly about her waist and guided to a sofa where she sat fretfully twisting her fingers about and all but refusing the glass of liqueur which, in the event, Percy brought to her lips himself and so gained excuse to sit close beside her. Having poured it beyond her sight, he had seen to it that it contained a modicum of the selfsame potion that had put Mildred into the land of dreams, a single drop that would render Susan slightly drowsy.</p>
   <p>'I do not understand Mama. It has never happened before', she murmured as the warm liquid trickled down her throat and meandered into her belly.</p>
   <p>'Loneliness and desire, my dear. The latter is paramount, I believe. Rest your head back. Was it dusty on the train? Really, you should remove your dress. Finish your drink. It should be taken at a swallow'.</p>
   <p>'But, uncle, I…glug!' gurgled Susan as the glass, raised by his hand, issued the rest of the sweet fiery liquid over her tongue. Cradled by his arm about her shoulders, she had indeed sunk back, her head resting on the low edge of the sofa. Beneath the hazy look that had stolen into her eyes, she observed the movement of a hand that wafted across her protruding titties, hesitated and then cupped the nearest.</p>
   <p>'Desire is potent in females at times, my dear. Your Mama chose to unveil herself to me. It was dusk, you understand. The room was veiled in a certain mystery of delight. There was no help for her but to lower her drawers…'</p>
   <p>'Ho! Oh, Uncle, pray-oh please…!' came a soft moan from Susan who felt as though her head were enveloped in clouds. Helplessly slipping sideways, her cheek rested upon his shoulder.</p>
   <p>'Yes, of course, my dear, I will tell you more', uttered Percy, deliberately misconstruing her cry, 'Her thighs and belly once seen, the lips of her slit ridged with desire, there was naught for me in the course of my brotherly duty but to produce my organ of procreation-that is to say my penis, cock, pego, prick. In but a moment your Mama clasped it in her palm and glided her tongue into my mouth. Feeling her bared belly against the knob of my rammer, desire fired my veins in equal measure. Here upon this very carpet I bedewed her delicious cunt with my sperm whereupon, after many luscious kisses and sighs of profound pleasure your dear Mama begged me to afford you the same lubricious joy'.</p>
   <p>How many of his words entered Susan's half-drowsy mind, he could never know. Vaguely aware that amid a torrent of speech such as she had never heard before, she was now reclining fully on the sofa, she was aware of hands coursing up her thighs, of fingers untying the bows of her drawers.</p>
   <p>Whimpers issued from her, but even they were dulled by the haze that invaded her mind like a fog. Her skirts folded up, worked beneath her bottom and her drawers then being swiftly removed, Susan lay for the first time naked from the waist down to a male. Her hands fluttered, but could do no more that that. Nor could she raise her arms, for they felt leaden. As to her mental state, it was on the whole a pleasant one, much as might be said to be enjoyed by the smokers of hashish in Eastern climes.</p>
   <p>Feeling her elegantly-stockinged legs parted, Susan issued a soft, tremulous sigh and allowed the fine froth of curls around her pubic mound to be displayed to her uncle who- having risen in order that she might recline-unbuttoned himself slowly and displayed his glowing erection.</p>
   <p>It mattered not that Susan appeared not to notice this lewd display, for her face was turned sideways, her eyes half closed.</p>
   <p>There was time, thought Percy, to toy with her first. Her cuntlips, though pursed, glistened with the warmth of the day and the effects of her journey.</p>
   <p>The fruit needed to be moistened more, and thus he knelt and moved his face up between her long, slim legs.</p>

    <p>Chapter Eighteen</p>
   </title>
   <p>'What am I to teach?'</p>
   <p>In so asking Vanessa, Margaret twisted her fingers nervously and rather wished that she had not permitted their first conversation to occur.</p>
   <p>'Here in your bedroom is surely the best place, my dear', replied her companion obliquely. 'Do you not think the greater part of education dull? I do. How badly I was birched for not attending to my sums and my spelling!'</p>
   <p>'Were you?' Margaret asked with curiosity. From being seated on the small sofa under her bow-fronted window, she had moved to the bed, sat for a while, and then returned restlessly to her original place.</p>
   <p>'Oh yes. My governess delighted in it and would frequently permit my cousin Alex to watch the raising of my skirts and the lambasting of my poor bottom which was kept so upraised that naught was hid from his view. He then being fifteen to my seventeen years, even so there was an evident arousal in him that did not fail to be observed. My governess would then attend to him in turn while I lay sobbing and with my reddened derriere exposed. Once his trousers had been removed, I could not help but observe how the applications of the twigs across his buttocks caused his pego to stiffen and rise. Boys of that age or thereabouts have such lovely cocks, I think, don't you?'</p>
   <p>'My dear, really', Margaret gulped.</p>
   <p>'Hence I feel that you should teach anatomy, Margaret- both the female and the male, I mean. Otherwise, what crude things the boys learn for themselves, and not always from the best of friends. You, my dear, can nurture them and encourage them. In a word, Margaret, you will assist in producing their emissions while revealing such delectable parts of your voluptuous figure as may receive such'.</p>
   <p>'I would… I would not know how to begin such! Oh, you will surely lead me into paths of sin', gasped Margaret</p>
   <p>with considerable untruth.</p>
   <p>'The paths of sin are frequently the paths of pleasure, Margaret. Gird yourself for the latter, or rather ungird yourself to your corset and stockings for you and they will then best be prepared. Come, let me assist you-let me unhook your dress'.</p>
   <p>'No, please, I cannot!'</p>
   <p>'We do not always have a choice in such matters, my dear', was the dry reply from Vanessa who had not forgotten her first encounters with the Vicar. Drawing Margaret to her feet, she observed her flushed face with pleasure. The cheeks were slightly puffy, which betrayed her thoughts far better than her words. 'Quickly, Margaret, please. I have other duties to attend to. I alone can ensure your privacy henceforth by diverting the attentions of others. There- you see-what little trouble it is to disrobe, and what a saucy corsellette you are wearing! Why, it displays your bush to perfection. Such sleek thighs-how plump and rich! Sit up, though, on the bed, and lean your back against the pillowed rails. Draw one knee up but keep your thighs together for you look most tempting so. A peep of cunny is all that they will need at first, my dear'.</p>
   <p>'I cannot! You know I cannot!' flustered Margaret, finding herself handled and positioned so with her nipples peeping above the lace of her corsellette whose hem coursed across the lower part of her belly and left her dark thatch uncovered.</p>
   <p>'Your nephews are waiting in attendance upon you, Margaret. I have despatched your sons on an errand into the town. Alice is closeted in her room. Mabel I will deal with. Tomorrow Bertie and Hugh will receive their first lessons in your agile fingers'.</p>
   <p>'They? No, oh no! Ah!' gasped Margaret of a sudden as Vanessa's hand smacked whippingly across her cheek.</p>
   <p>'Obedience, Margaret, is a requisite of education. Upon my sending your nephews in to you, I shall lock the door from without. You have an hour to indulge yourself. Use your time wisely and cause their fine young cocks to bubble and spurt out their uttermost'.</p>
   <p>'Van-ess-a!'</p>
   <p>But the young woman was already sweeping out and Margaret's cry died upon the abrupt opening of the door. It closed again and she felt her cheek which burned still from the impact of Vanessa's stinging blow. Scrambling up and with her magnificent titties swinging out all but free from the confines of her waist-tight corsellette, she bent to gaze in her dressing table mirror at where a red flush still remained upon her left cheek.</p>
   <p>She hit me, Margaret thought in wonderment, and yet at the same time her belly swam with desire. She was being forced now to do that which she had but surreptitiously done before, and yet was at the same time under protection, guarded, watched by this strange young woman who seemingly permitted all provided that she did obey.</p>
   <p>Soothing her cheek, Margaret decided that she had moments to spare and seated herself on the padded stool before her mirror, thus causing her bottom to project alluring over the back edge of it where her nether cheeks spread slightly. Taking a hairbrush, she commenced tidying her locks when the door opened again of a sudden and Freddy and George, naked and with erect cocks, were urged within by a hidden Vanessa.</p>
   <p>Seeing them in her looking glass, Margaret momentarily froze. The two boys approached her hesitantly, their stiff cocks bobbing, coming one on each side of her.</p>
   <p>The turning of a key from outside sounded then.</p>
   <p>'The lady said…', George began hesitantly.</p>
   <p>'She is naughty', Margaret uttered softly. Her eyes closed, her head hung back. Dropping her hands and turning her palms, she ran her fingers up between their smooth young legs and grasped their stiff penises in her warm palms.</p>
   <p>'She said-she said she would keep the door locked while we do it to you, Aunty', Freddy said.</p>
   <p>It was a dream, Margaret decided. Freddy had already begun tentatively to caress her bulging tits. Roughly and excitedly, George pulled her head back more and mashed his mouth over hers. Their tongues met, touched, coiled, were wet. The stool was slipping from under her, but between them they managed to prevent her from bumping on the floor as all three went down and the stool subsided with a thump.</p>
   <p>'On the floor, Aunty, do it on the floor', George husked, and then he was on her belly first and the carpet rubbed her back, and as the helmet of his eager prick slid up between her cuntlips, Margaret knew that he would come too soon, and yet it didn't matter. They had time, had time, had time…</p>
   <p>As also did Vanessa now. The audience-for such it proved to be under the spell of her discourse-consisted of a surprised, disturbed but not unexcited and intrigued Eric Partridge together with Mabel.</p>
   <p>Of the two, Mabel was the more disturbed and with many a fluttering of butterflies in her silky tummy. Utterly unprepared for such a triple encounter, she had donned but one of her misty robes beneath which she wore a pair of white drawers with red silk ties, white stockings with pink garters that secured their tops tightly and sleekly halfway up her thighs, and a pretty pair of slippers encrusted with imitation pearls.</p>
   <p>Rather aghast that her Papa should see her so flimsily attired, she held the robe around her with one clutching hand, the which merely caused her milky breasts to appear even more protuberant where the material gathered.</p>
   <p>'Mabel is progressing so well, Mr. Partridge. I thought I should make you cognizant with this. Her absorption of knowledge is excellent. Is that not so, Mabel?'</p>
   <p>'I-er-yes, I don't know. I mean…', Mabel choked, for as much as she tried to hold together the lower folds of her robe, so they slipped apart to reveal the creamy columns of her thighs and the puckered legs of her drawers.</p>
   <p>'Modesty, you see, becomes her. Oh, forgive me for standing, but I occasionally love to', Vanessa said languidly, leaning against the mantelpiece in her room while the two faced her in chairs which she had arranged of a purpose, Mr. Partridge being constrained occasionally to seemingly need to scratch one side of his neck which thus caused him to require to turn his head and glimpse again and again the fetching lines of Mabel's legs and the profiles of her milky tits.</p>
   <p>'As I was saying before-for is it not pleasant to be discursive sometimes? — these new servants I have are utterly amusing. I feel almost medieval, you know, for in a sense they are willing vassals-and with such <emphasis>animality! </emphasis>One is reminded occasionally of farmyard behavior-and yet there is a certain charm to it-an innocence of desire, a veritable bubbling of the springs of passion.</p>
   <p>'I told you-did? Yes. I told you just now that it was needful for Elsie to be caned. She is about your age, Mabel, and so fetching of form'.</p>
   <p>'Miss-er-Markham, I wonder…', began Eric whose head was slightly spinning at the frank manner of her words. He was about to suggest they might have a word in private, for he felt awed by the possibilities that might arise from such a conversation, yet at the same time his lips frequently twitched with nervous excitement,</p>
   <p>'Yes? To have a small glass of sherry, perhaps. Oh, delightful! May I pour? Shall I be hostess? Mabel, you would like some surely. Yes, you would, I know', Vanessa said brightly and-while the two sat breathing in a rather forced manner-filled three glasses and handed them theirs with a flourish of pleasure.</p>
   <p>'Ah, how pleasant it is to relax and to be undisturbed', Vanessa continued, 'What was I saying? I forget'.</p>
   <p>'About your servants-Elsie', preferred Eric hesitantly while a flush spread into Mabel's cheeks.</p>
   <p>'Thus it was, yes. Her caning. The girl whimpered and squealed of course, having-and pray forgive the term- her bottom uncovered completely. A quite lovely derriere she has-the like of yours, Mabel. Oh, you blush, I see, but you need not. We are in close and confidential company. I admit that I wondered much about the effect and outcome of my swishing the cane across her delightful cheeks, for I had put her father to work on erecting some shelves in the neighbouring room. Rough in his manner, but discreet and dutiful as he is, he did not enquire of her squeals and I asked myself hence what might happen were I to leave Elsie abruptly in the naked and wriggling state I had left her. Really, it was thoroughly amusing, though. The final outcome I mean'.</p>
   <p>'Ah!' uttered Mr. Partridge at that and stole another glance at Mabel's stockinged legs.</p>
   <p>Mabel seemed to wish to speak. Her mouth worked, her Adam's apple rose and fell. Arching her eyebrows enquiringly, Vanessa asked of her what she wished to say.</p>
   <p>'I s'pose… I was wondering… About my lessons, Miss', Mabel uttered at last with a touch of desperation in her tone.</p>
   <p>'Oh, but lessons are absorbed in so <emphasis>many </emphasis>ways, my dear. Do you not concur, Mr. Partridge? But alas, I have forgotten the thread of my discourse again'.</p>
   <p>'You had-er… You had, er, left the girl unclothed and caned, Miss Markham'.</p>
   <p>'Oh why, of course-so I had! My departure being heard in the neighbouring room, I retired to a closet. No sooner had I done so than… Oh, Mabel, I trust I will not offend your ears, but you DO remember what I have told you about Nature Studies? Well, DO You?'</p>
   <p>A gurgle came from Mabel which Vanessa evidently interpreted as a positive reply, for she nodded as if pleased with her pupil's response.</p>
   <p>'As the cock to the hen, as the bull to the cow, thus it was. Had I made such an invitation too explicit, do you think? It is so difficult to tell. In any event, there was an almost immediate and comforting attendance upon her. In such circumstances, girls may be surprised, but are not too reluctant. Elsie uttered a single squeal and then was quiet. With quite primitive and yet divine understanding of her immediate needs, the plunger was inserted between the very cheeks I had heated. A rumbustious smacking of her bottom cheeks to him was heard. Their grunts and moans were quite of the lewdest nature, yet divine to hear. The smacking</p>
   <p>ounds of flesh grew faster. Such of their class, I fear, show little finesse at such times and yet flourish fruitfully in their pleasures. Why, to some it would appear frightfully naughty, I suppose, and yet I felt their deep, desiring pleasure-felt it in my very veins. It was as though I were part of the act and yet removed from it. Nor could I find it in my heart to remonstrate with them, permitting myself only to tiptoe from the closet and, by peeping around the door, to view the final moments of their orgasmic ecstasy. Really, Mabel, you should finish your drink'.</p>
   <p>'B… b… b…', stammered Mabel, now a bright red.</p>
   <p>'Tut-tut, my pet, it is all part of the pageantry of life. We overlook it at our peril, do we not? A pretence of ignorance is something I find utterly annoying-distasteful even. With the slow removal of his doughty penis, I observed the rim of her sweet rose frothing with such delight as he had injected into her. Thus it was and thus it often is, my sweet. Do you wish me to hide the facts of life from you?'</p>
   <p>'I want… I want to go to the water closet!' Mabel wailed in desperation.</p>
   <p>'Now? At such a moment? There is a potty beneath the bed, you silly. Rise and use it', uttered Vanessa to the vast but excited amazement of Eric.</p>
   <p>'Ah, no! I must go!'</p>
   <p>'You have indeed said so, Mabel. Up with you now- UP! Are my private lessons to have been in vain?'</p>
   <p>So speaking, Vanessa went forward and, taking Mabel's wrists, brought her sharply to her feet and so quickly that Mabel's glass tilted, causing three quarters of her sherry to spill down over the front of her gown.</p>
   <p>'I say!' ejaculated Eric, jumping up and retrieving the fallen glass, this movement bringing him into such a posture and closer to Mabel that he was vouchsafed a heavenly glimpse of the crotch of her drawers where he could see the wadding of her pubic hairs.</p>
   <p>A cry, though of a different tone, escaped Mabel too in that moment, for as swiftly as her hands could move so Vanessa denuded her of her thin robe to the waist, imprisoning her arms by virtue of the falling of the back of the garment and the tightening of the sleeves.</p>
   <p>'Ah no! Papa, pray do not look! Let me escape!'</p>
   <p>'Escape? Is that your will and your philosophy? Very well-go. There is the key. You may unlock the door', Vanessa said coldly.</p>
   <p>As she spoke, so she released Mabel and, drawing the key from her bosom, cast it down across the room upon the floor while Eric-rigid by then in all respects-stood motionless.</p>
   <p>Her only desire in that moment being to escape, and with her full titties bobbing their appealing brown nipples freely, Mabel burned with a wobbling 'Oh!' and in several steps succeeded in bending to retrieve the key. Such however being the moment that Vanessa desired, she moved far more swiftly than the girl whose bottom was pointing up to both. Seizing Mabel's waist and ringing it tightly, she afforded the girl's noble young orb three stinging smacks that so made themselves felt-so tingled and burned into her luscious halfmoons-that Mabel squealed and wriggled like a schoolgirl, finally falling forward onto her face and squirming her rump all about as though she were endeavouring to swim.</p>
   <p>'You have the key. Get up, Mabel-UP!' intoned Vanessa.</p>
   <p>Drawing herself back onto her knees and then shamefacedly scrambling to her feet with the freed globes of her marbled breasts jiggling, Mabel uttered a cry of seeming despair and staggered to the door, endeavouring to fumble the key into the lock even as Vanessa's voice caught her again like a whiplash.</p>
   <p>'Mabel! You realise that I shall have to cane you later, do you not? Answer me, girl!'</p>
   <p>Awestruck and gulping, Mabel swung her head to meet Vanessa's eyes.</p>
   <p>'Well?' came the stern demand.</p>
   <p>Sobbing, choking and stammering, there came from Mabel a drawn-out sound that much resembled 'Yes'.</p>
   <p>'And you will know why, Mabel? Do not pass though that door until you have answered me correctly'.</p>
   <p>Spellbound in that extraordinary moment as she appeared to be, and with her fingers trembling on the doorhandle, Mabel appeared to hold her breath for a long moment, her head hung. The whispered word that was finally emitted from her lips scarcely reached the ears of her two listeners and brought Vanessa to demand that she repeat it.</p>
   <p>'I said… I said, yes…oh!' Mabel choked and, turning the key, fled.</p>
   <p>'My goodness!' Eric exclaimed.</p>
   <p>'Your goodness, if such you can call it-and well it may be if put to a proper purpose-is displaying itself remarkably well', observed Vanessa, looking pointedly down at the erection that was thrusting up his trouser-front and which Mabel, too, could not have failed to see.</p>
   <p>'You really mean to cane her? When?'</p>
   <p>'Impatience?' Vanessa laughed, 'There is no other way now, my dear, and well she knows it. Her lovely bottom cheeks will ripple and tighten all day at the thought of what is to be. She will wriggle hotly enough for you when you put your poker up'.</p>
   <p>'You believe that to be possible? Tonight?'</p>
   <p>'Possible?' riposted Vanessa, floating to the door. 'Keep your cock stiff for her, my dear, for I ordain it!'</p>

   <title>
    <p>Chapter Nineteen</p>
   </title>
   <p>In the dreamy, clouded state in which she lay, Susan stirred restlessly, rolling her noble, bared bottom on the silky surface of the sofa. Sublime sensations surrounded and filled the furred slit where the Vicar's long tongue had so remorselessly licked that her salty spills of love dew had already issued thrice, producing a patch of dampness where she reclined.</p>
   <p>Limp as a doll, she allowed herself to be turned over, feeling as if she were rolling endlessly through space. Clasping her lithe, slim form by her naked hips, her uncle drew her slowly back, so manoeuvring and raising her by slow degrees that the elegantly-formed maiden was brought to drape herself in readiness over the thicked, rolled arm of the sofa, her derriere perfectly poised for an assault.</p>
   <p>How to instill in her a variety of sensations that her mind and body would retain fascinated Percy. Parting her long legs so that the clip of her slit showed its figlike form beneath her bottom's chubby cheeks, he accorded both a light smack that made his palm delight in the resilience of those demi-orbs.</p>
   <p>A squeak emanated from Susan, but no more than that. Trailing one digit up between her pale halfmoons, he circled the tip of it around her puckered hole which offered such a delicious tightness to the intended intrusion of his prick.</p>
   <p>Another smack, this time across her bottom, and this time producing a soft and appealing 'Ooh!' which caused Percy to nod his head approvingly. In her sublime state of somnolence and revealment, the tawse would now be appropriate, though not applied too strongly or it might awaken her. Retreating momentarily, he acquired his leather friend together with a small pot of unguent. From the latter he smeared his first finger and — holding the chubby cheeks of her bottom apart-applied the oily substance around the rim of her rosehole and, at the same time, working some within, this causing Susan to wriggle her hips agreeably.</p>
   <p>'Your anointment, my angel', Percy uttered quietly and therewith brought the tawse slap-crack across her offered peach.</p>
   <p>'Thoooo!' uttered Susan dreamily. She was dimly aware of a stinging sensation at first, but no more than that, for the tawse was evenly supplied, but with a medium stroke, producing a first light flush on the ivory hemispheres.</p>
   <p>Thereupon Percy waited, for he wanted her to absorb this completely new feeling. Some twenty seconds passed before he applied the next. The fleshy, slap-smacking sound pleased him, as it always did when attending upon young ladies. Besides, she had a superb bum and with due training could become a regular recipient of his lascivious intentions. Together with her Mama, perhaps. That would be infinitely amusing-a completely new experience.</p>
   <p>At that thought Percy's intentions began to rage more fiercely, for once a man has certain ideas in his mind he can never forget them.</p>
   <p>Cra-aaaack! sounded the tawse, and harder than he had meant to apply it, but the excitement of anticipation was uppermost in him.</p>
   <p>Susan's nether cheeks reddened under the stinging stroke. Her arms moved restlessly, her hips churned. A greater awareness stole through her of a sensation of stinging and of heat in her bottom. Slender tongues of fire licked between her halfmoons, producing a hot feeling in her nether hole and even causing her succulent slit to moisten.</p>
   <p>Noticing that the movements of both her torso and her hips were increasing, Percy ceased his applications of the tawse and dipped an exploratory finger under the sticky slit which his niece offered so blatantly to his view. Yes-there was the expected, slight exudation there: a most promising sign. Moving to the side of her prone form, he bent and turned her flushed face in his direction, falling to his knees and bringing his lips to brush her own lax ones.</p>
   <p>Susan's long eyelashes fluttered still. Her eyelids felt too heavy to open completely. The drawing room was seen as in a hazy dream. A tongue licked along her lips-protruded into her mouth. A voice, husky and deep, sounded in her ear.</p>
   <p>'Strap, bottom and prick, Susan. Say it after me'.</p>
   <p>'St… st… bot, bot, bot', Susan stammered thickly, for the words were like glue in her mouth.</p>
   <p>'Learning. You are learning. Repeat that you are learning, Susan'.</p>
   <p>'L… l… learning'. Heavy and drowsy her voice. Her tongue was limp to his own but would soon awaken, Percy thought.</p>
   <p>'Good girls obey, Susan. Repeat after me, good girls obey'.</p>
   <p>'Goo girls, goo girls'.</p>
   <p>'What do good girls do, Susan?'</p>
   <p>"Bey… Obey'.</p>
   <p>'Yes, my dear. Uncle is going to put you to his cock now. Be good. Lie still. Hold your bottom up'.</p>
   <p>'Hold…', Susan echoed, her voice sounding hollow.</p>
   <p>Percy rose again and moved behind her. Hands caressed Susan's bottom then, causing her hips to roll more agreeably. Fingers sprang her springy cheeks apart, exposing that which she had never thought to expose to man or woman. The unguent that Percy had previously supplied glistened in waiting around her puckered aperture.</p>
   <p>Penis erect and head glowing, he thrust his trousers down beyond his knees and gently applied the fiery crest so that its tip nestled against Susan's untried bumhole. At its touch her hips jerked a little, whereat Percy withdrew, moistened the head of his charger with saliva and then unhesitatingly entered it but just an inch within the warm and exquisitely tight hole, this bringing another jerk of his niece's body and a low murmur from her lips.</p>
   <p>'Good girls obey, Susan'.</p>
   <p>'Hoooo!' Susan moaned. The feeling of the bold intruder was more evident to her now. She made, as Percy well expected, to retract her hips, but the pressure of her stockinged thighs against the end of the sofa prevented it.</p>
   <p>For a moment the ring of her bottomhole was so tight that he could enter no further. It was indeed as if his pego were encased in the entrance to a finger of a glove, yet such he had encountered before and knew that the only recourse with such a virginal receptacle was to enter smoothly and with no hesitation.</p>
   <p>Accordingly, Percy's own buttocks tightened as he pushed, this producing a mewing sound from Susan who made feebly to raise the upper part of her body whereat he arced over her and clamped his hand firmly around the nape of her neck, so securing her in what he deemed to be the classic position, for quite magically the female supplicant appeared to offer her bottom more freely thus-and Susan did.</p>
   <p>True, the marbled cheeks of her derriere made to squirm as his stiff fleshy peg embedded itself remorselessly in her most secret orifice. Little cries of mingling pleasure and despair rose from her. Her face twisted this way and that, her nose rubbing on the seat of the sofa. The plunger- though proceeding slowly as it was-had all but entered her to the full and to her dimmed senses felt both torturous and exciting. It was stretching her, opening her, filling her… OOOOH!</p>
   <p>'Pmmmmff!' Susan choked. Her senses, stirred by the deeply-rooting salute of her uncle's penis, were awakening more. The clouds in her mind drifted slowly apart, permitting both light and realisation to enter. Her bottom by now was fully orbed into his belly and beneath her hairy pouch she could feel the swaying of his balls. Yet was it he? Could it possibly be? Was she not being lewdly assaulted by a stranger and dreaming all the rest?</p>
   <p>Feeling his grip upon the back of her neck loosen, Susan turned her head and opened her eyes fully, expecting perhaps to see the face of the Devil himself. Yet instead, to her disbelief, her gaze met her uncle's.</p>
   <p>'Ah, my love, I am up your bottom at last', Percy croaked.</p>
   <p>'NO, Uncle, no! Take it… AAAAH! — you beast, you brute, take it out!'</p>
   <p>'Remove my cock from your bottom, my sweet niece?</p>
   <p>Never, my dear, for it is going to receive many such salutes, as is your divine nest. Come now, allow me to pump your hole and make not too much fuss of it or I shall bring the tawse to you again, my girl'.</p>
   <p>'Mama, Mama, ma-ma! Hooo! Ah! It's too BIG!'</p>
   <p>'Quietly, Susan, quietly. You must learn to be quiet', Percy husked, drawing but half of his stiff penis from her sucking hole, but letting the rest remain within as her momentary comforter.</p>
   <p>Her sobs resounding, Susan screwed up her eyes. Much as the first entry had teased, taunted and burned her, so the more gentle movements-but an inch or two back and forth-began to assuage her against her will. Clasping her well-sprung cheeks, Percy held her bottomhole exposed while leaning back a trifle to watch with bleared pleasure the rooting of his cock in her. How tightly the rim gripped him still, and yet its natural elasticity allowed increasingly easier movements.</p>
   <p>'Don't, don't! How horrible! Oh!' Thus Susan moaned, though her cries had notably quietened again, the breath puffing out from her pursed lips as Percy now began to run his true course, drawing his cock out all but to the rim and then pistoning powerfully into her clinging tube.</p>
   <p>'Yee-oooh!Yeee-oooh! Mama, Mama!'</p>
   <p>Smack, smack, smack! Susan's bottom sounded against Percy's hard belly while his fervent rod rammed her faster.</p>
   <p>'Let me feel your cunt, now, Susan-let me feel it-let Uncle feel it'.</p>
   <p>'Gooo! No! Ah!'</p>
   <p>Insinuating one hand down between the side of the sofa and her belly, Percy succeeded in cupping her now pulpy slit, sidling the tip of his forefinger around her button which had grown perkier with his pumping motions. Gritting her teeth and grimacing, rolling her eyes and turning her face this way and that on the seat, Susan made one last valiant effort to resist. But in a second or two even more thrilling electrical charges were shooting through her lithe form. Her nub rose even more to Percy's encouraging finger, his cock-jabs up her bottom quickening more.</p>
   <p>'Ah, my good girl, give it to me, work your bottom', he husked, licking all around one shell-like ear and at the corner of her mouth.</p>
   <p>'Oh-ho! Un-cle!'</p>
   <p>But it was a plea now rather than a protest, and one that he wished but to encourage. She was spilling-the sweet girl was actually spilling on his finger, little milky spurts. And such she had probably never sustained before, as he told himself.</p>
   <p>Susan indeed had not. In that instant her whole body and mind were transformed from coldness, rigidity and shyness into a blaze of lubricious passion. Her buttocks began to roll lewdly as Percy came upright again, his prick easing back and forth between her springy cheeks to the moaning delight of the pair until with a series of choking gasps he exploded the long shoots of his orgasmic pleasure into the very depths of her flawless bum while Susan again and again sprinkled the rolled top of the sofa arm in her newfound delight.</p>
   <p>Long moments passed before the pair finally uncoupled. Percy withdrew his slackening slug from her well-creamed hole while Susan wriggled forward shyly and lay once more along the length of the sofa, hiding her hot face.</p>
   <p>Restoring his trousers and feeling somewhat weak at the knees, Percy seated himself precariously beside her on the very edge of the sofa and patted her bottom affectionately.</p>
   <p>'Was naughty…'</p>
   <p>Susan's muffled voice came to him, her face well hidden, yet there was wondering pleasure in her tone that conveyed much to Percy. Withholding a reply, he continued coaxing her with his fingertips, running them over the swelling, velvety surfaces of her proud nether cheeks.</p>
   <p>'If Mama knows…' A desperate little squeak.</p>
   <p>'She will awaken soon. Chide her not for drinking. Say naught of it. I will pleasure you again tonight, Susan, when she sleeps'.</p>
   <p>'Mustn't'-yet the tone again was one of a choked giggle, causing Percy to turn the svelte, curvaceous form of his niece towards him so that she was brought to conceal her blushing visage against his chest.</p>
   <p>'Obedience, Susan. You recall what I said about obedience? You do, do you not?'</p>
   <p>A gulp sounded. After but a moment's hesitation, Susan nodded blindly. Surreptitiously she tightened her bottom cheeks to retain the thick globs of sperm he had injected into her. They felt warm and infinitely wicked, but delicious. She could still feel his thick long penis working steadily between the plump cheeks of her derriere which now reared more willingly to his coaxing palm.</p>
   <p>'Tonight, Susan-you understand?'</p>
   <p>'I want to go and see Mama now, Uncle'.</p>
   <p>'I said, tonight Susan'.</p>
   <p>So speaking, Percy inserted his digit in her creamy rosehole again, causing her to murmur and wriggle.</p>
   <p>'Yes, Uncle. Mama will not know, though, will she?'</p>
   <p>Of deliberation, Percy refrained from answering that and, removing his questing and sticky digit, rose from her.</p>
   <p>'Go, my pet-go and see your dear Mama. Leave your drawers where they lie. You will have no more need of them today', he opined, turning his back upon her and gazing out onto the grounds. 'Yes, Uncle'.</p>
   <p>Smiling with pleasure, Percy did not turn. It was best for the moment to show an authoritative back to her.</p>
   <p>His niece was all but converted now to such paths as he might lead them both.</p>

    <p>Chapter Twenty</p>
   </title>
   <p>A man who moves uneasily about his own house does so almost by stealth, as Eric was doing. His erectile prominence had by no means diminished and his sense of profound frustration was beginning to be succeeded by one of irritation. Dammit, the woman Vanessa was a remarkable and lovely creature whom he would love to bed, but hour by hour and day by day his authority (which in all fact he had never exercised to any great extent) was diminishing.</p>
   <p>And where the devil was Margaret? Taking the upper hallway, he made to attempt her door when there came to his ears the sound of moans, accompanied by others which were of an even stranger nature. His hand raised itself to knock, but then faltered and fell as Vanessa made a sudden appearance from Mabel's room.</p>
   <p>'Margaret is indisposed', Vanessa said quickly before Eric could speak. Laying her hand upon his arm, she murmured, 'There are other duties for you to perform, I believe'.</p>
   <p>'You will-er-that is, see to Margaret?' he enquired endeavouring to keep his ears cocked, but being too much diverted to hear much more.</p>
   <p>'You will see to Mabel?' riposted Vanessa, bringing a flush into his cheeks.</p>
   <p>'You have caned her already?'</p>
   <p>'I have told her of my displeasure at her foolishly winsome attitude. It is not really in her nature at all, you know, not really at all. You might perhaps apprise me later if it is indeed necessary for me to cane her, though I have left her in no doubt that I intend to. Hence there is no need to disabuse her on that point. She is dressing now and much confused as to her future behaviour in your presence. One cannot leave such a problem unresolved. It may be necessary for you to show an authoritative hand-in the right place, that is'.</p>
   <p>'I will speak to her', Eric responded stiffly.</p>
   <p>'The summerhouse, perhaps, or a canter in the woods? The motions of a girl's bottom on the saddle quite agitates her, I am told-but forgive me, such you will already know and put to good use, I am sure', Vanessa added, seeing his eyes narrow a little and judging his mood better than he knew.</p>
   <p>'You may be certain that I will advise you, Miss Mark-ham'.</p>
   <p>'With this?' Vanessa asked, bringing a smile to her velvety lips and touching his trouser-covered Priapus lightly and causing him to grit his teeth.</p>
   <p>'Most possibly. I trust you will be available?'</p>
   <p>'Come, my dear, we are but fencing, are we not? Your duty is as plain as is Mabel's daughterly duty to her sire. Mount her, Eric. I have already allowed you several views of her delightful pastures. Her cunny is warm and soft, her eyes limpid. Her titties will swell to your palm. She is sufficiently on heat to succumb, but you must be firm with her. Cleave her with your rod and have no nonsense about the matter. Meanwhile I will see to Margaret, but first I will fetch her a damp flannel to cool her forehead'.</p>
   <p>'Till tonight, then', Eric responded doggedly, as if the matter of which she were speaking were of less import</p>
   <p>'We shall see'.</p>
   <p>Making her way slowly to the nearest bathroom, Vanessa covertly observed his departure with a smile of satisfaction. She had no intention of disturbing Margaret since it must seem to the boys that their aunt was the sole seducer. As indeed Margaret at that moment was. Both boys having spermed her cunny, and her back being marked from their weights upon her on the floor (an exercise which she had found quite enchanting), she had retired to the bed and lay toying with their half-limp cocks.</p>
   <p>As for Fred and George, they were minded to wonder how such could continue to pass without interruptions, and were becoming a trifle nervous of discovery, as Margaret could sense. Secure in the knowledge that Vanessa alone held the key to her room, however, the emboldened lady took it upon herself to suck their love-slimed knobs in turn, causing them each to groan and jerk their hips.</p>
   <p>'My darlings, you have not finished with Aunty yet, have you?' she asked luringly, this invitation bringing a gurgle of pleasure from both. Her long broad tongue licked up and down their virile young stems as she spoke-she kneeling up and the boys lying on either side of her.</p>
   <p>'Gaaar! W… w… want to do it in your mouth, Aunty', George groaned, moving his fiery piston up and down between her sucking lips.</p>
   <p>'But Aunty prefers it a different way, does she not? How does she like it best, Freddy?'</p>
   <p>With a little puffing gasp of pleasure, her younger nephew felt then his own straining pego drawn into her warm, inviting mouth, her lips slewing up and down the slender rod.</p>
   <p>'B… b… both together?' he stammered, working his hips in frustration as those juicy lips left his crest glowing.</p>
   <p>'Good boy, yes. Aunty likes one up her cunt and one up her bottom-together, my angels. George, lie still and keep your legs together while I take my seat on you. Freddy will act as postillion and work his cock up my bottom at the same time. Ah, you naughty boys-yes!' Margaret gurgled as at that George all but hauled her plump thighs a-straddle over his legs and caused his prick to jut up under her already-creamed quim while Freddy positioned himself with his young poker eager to assault her nether hole.</p>
   <p>'Hoo-oooh, slowly-both of you! Together-together-ah, yes, George, get up my cunny first-there- ah! Now Freddy you, darling, yes, can you get it in? Is it tight?'</p>
   <p>'Oh, Aunty, Aunty, yes!' Freddy panted. The close-rimming but spongy interior of her slit gripped him possessively as he worked his peg in-between her fat bumcheeks while George, having already rooted himself and feeling her pubic bush grazing and tickling his own, was all but a prisoner beneath his aunt.</p>
   <p>A hissing gasp escaped Margaret at the full invasion of Freddy's cock which, being more slender than his brother's, was superbly fashioned to bugger her sleekly. Feeling her rearing cheeks ram into his belly, he clasped her waist while George nibbled at her stiff nipples.</p>
   <p>'Too-hoo-geth-er!' Margaret moaned. She had taught them already how to work their cocks alternatively in her close apertures and-as Freddy slowly withdrew his flaming piston-so her hips rose and fell to bring a rhythm to the lascivious triple act that seemed to turn her belly to molten lava and, with but several deep-plunging strokes on the part of both her nephews, caused her to swooningly sprinkle her pearls over George's well-sheathed cock.</p>
   <p>The moans that then sounded came softly through the door, causing a passing Vanessa to tut-tut amusedly and smile to herself. Another half an hour and she would unlock the door as a signal to Margaret to release her young sex slaves, since such they appeared to be. But Vanessa had no envy of that. It was as pleasing to her to manipulate as to enjoy-a vicarious pleasure, perhaps, but there were always males in waiting to service her. Even Reggie, who would somehow have to be fitted into the new entourage rather than the other way round. Most amusing, and it served him right.</p>
   <p>Eric meanwhile, having entered Mabel's room, found her preparing to don a blue chemise trimmed with cream lace. Other than that she was attired only in drawers and dark blue stockings and shoes, her breasts bobbing in firmly-jellied fashion as she strove quickly to cover them.</p>
   <p>'Your dress and drawers will suffice, Mabel. I intend that we shall go for a refreshing ride. Let me not find you wearing other than those. I shall await you downstairs. Five minutes!' uttered Eric with a firmness that astonished even himself.</p>
   <p>'Papa?' bleated Mabel who had succeeded in covering her twin globes, but was then forced to free them again as she pettishly and with reluctance cast off the chemise again, his words causing her brow to furrow. He had not even replied to her and that was unfair, especially as she was going to be caned later. Miss Markham had told her again that she was to be and had said that she knew why: 'Just as you yourself do, Mabel', Vanessa had said coolly during a brief 'lecture' in Mabel's boudoir.</p>
   <p>It was going to be awful, that stinging; she wouldn't be able to bear it, Mabel thought. Quite dizzy with conflicting ideas as to what was what and what she was about, Mabel cast on a dress, tidied her coiffure quickly and, with a sulky, pouting look, descended to find both her Papa and the groom waiting with two fine mounts.</p>
   <p>Stubbornly silent in the ensuing ten minutes, Mabel lagged a little behind her father until he turned, snapped his fingers angrily, and brought her to canter level with him.</p>
   <p>'Miss Markham is going to cane me, Papa', Mable said broodily as if that were an excuse for her laggardness.</p>
   <p>'It may be, it may be', Mr. Partridge replied crisply, aware that her eyes were darting to him curiously and with much wonder at his constrained attitude.</p>
   <p>'Papa, please, can you not persuade her otherwise?'</p>
   <p>'We will ride to the woodman's hut, Mabel', came the curt reply, whereupon Eric galloped forward, making his daughter follow with her hair streaming out from under her peaked velvet cap which, being boyishly fashioned, gave her an even more entrancing look.</p>
   <p>'Papa, I asked you something?' Mabel begged, jogging desperately up and down on the saddle.</p>
   <p>'In a moment, my dear, in a moment. Ah, there it is, and there is no one about, I see. We shall dismount and rest. Come within, for we shall be more in the shade there'.</p>
   <p>'But it is dark, Papa, within and my dress will get dirty!'</p>
   <p>'Inside, Mabel, I tell you!'</p>
   <p>Tethering his horse, Mr. Partridge strode within the low-roofed hut in one corner of which, as he well knew, was a crude structure known as a trestle which was used for sawing wood. It was an object which had occupied his mind for long minutes past. The floor was planked and fairly even, and the only light entered from the doorway in which Mabel hesitantly appeared, asking hesitantly, 'What is it, Papa?'</p>
   <p>'Wait here, my dear, and you will soon see', came the bewildering reply whereat, by peeping-and much to her astonishment-Mabel saw him divesting his mount of its saddle which he brought within and, brushing past her, laid across the top of the sturdy wooden trestle.</p>
   <p>'Wh… what is that for?' Mabel asked nervously, taking a step backwards to the more inviting doorway, but then having her wrist seized and finding herself drawn towards the darker wall.</p>
   <p>'You asked me a question, my pet. As to Miss Markham and her intention to cane you-it is a form of proper discipline for which you apparently knew the reason, did you not?'</p>
   <p>'No, Papa, really, I did not. Oh! what are you doing!'</p>
   <p>'You asked me to dissuade her, Mabel, from caning your bottom. I shall. Even so, I intend to apply my crop to you if you prove recalcitrant again, young lady. OVER, please- right over-yes!'</p>
   <p>'Oh, Papa, no! I…aaaah!' Mabel gasped as she found herself slid over the momentarily wobbling saddle which firmed itself the moment that her belly was pressed upon it. Head and shoulders hanging, and with the tips of her fingers just able to touch the floor beyond, Mabel wailed as a firm elbow settled in the small of her back, pinning her tightly over, while hands swirled her skirt up and piled its folds around her waist.</p>
   <p>'Papa, you mustn't! Oh what shame you bring me to! My drawers! NO! Oh don't-please, Papa, don't!' Mabel blathered as she felt that most intimate of her garments being loosed and swept down to form a puddle around her feet.</p>
   <p>'You will be still, Mabel, or I shall indeed bring the crop to your adorable buttocks much more fiercely than Miss Markham will wield the cane tonight. Unless I can persuade her otherwise, of course. You hear me?'</p>
   <p>'Yes, Papa-oh! but please don't look! YAH!' Mabel squealed as the leather tip of the crop swished across her bulbous bum, bringing a streak of fire in its wake.</p>
   <p>Having observed her every movement-or lack of such save for a wild and most inviting wriggling of her hips- Eric had stepped back to afford his well-curved daughter the first burning strike which, however, left no mark upon her rearing halfrnoons save for a pink blur. The rest of the skin was creamy and smooth, the furrow between the chubby hemispheres faintly tinged with a darker shade. By inclining his head downwards he could glimpse part of her delicious fig where brown curls sprouted around the tight-closed lips.</p>
   <p>'You said <emphasis>don't, </emphasis>Mabel, did you? Is it to be Miss Markham then?'</p>
   <p>'No, Papa-dear Papa-but-yeee-ouch!'</p>
   <p>'That was a second, my pet, for the <emphasis>but. </emphasis>You surrender your <emphasis>buts </emphasis>and your <emphasis>don'ts </emphasis>upon this day, d'you hear? Spread your legs more, Mabel-let it peep out more. You know of what I speak-you know'.</p>
   <p>Her face at first contorted and then slowly relaxing again as fanning heat surged around and between her stricken bottom cheeks, Mabel whimpered something incomprehensible, and this causing Mr. Partridge to ask sharply, 'What? Speak clearly, Mabel-HOLD your legs apart. What pretty stockings you have on indeed! The question now is mine. You know of what I speak'.</p>
   <p>A sniffling sounded then and Mabel's hips rotated once again, her belly gliding on the leather surface of the saddle. Waiting patiently, her sire heard at last a faint, reluctant 'Yes'.</p>
   <p>'It is good that you do, my pet, for it is about to receive its first injections. Steady now, Mabel-steady, I tell you'.</p>
   <p>'Yeeek!' Mabel squeaked, yet somehow managed to swallow most of the small, explosive utterance as a fingertip insinuated itself between her hot bumcheeks, tasted the ridged rim of her rosehole and then idled down until it was able to caress the pouting lovelips amid her nest of curls. Legs quivering and constraining herself not to close them, Mabel clenched her teeth and felt her belly swirl. A slow, deep breathing sounded above her as her oily crevice slowly received the enquiring digit which finally nestled within and between the silken walls of her nest.</p>
   <p>'You desire the crop again, Mabel?'</p>
   <p>'Whooo! N… no, Papa, but dear Papa, your finger…'</p>
   <p>'Is where it should have been long before, Mabel, and will often now intrude. I gather that you have been exercised before. I wish to know the merit of your movements. The crop is ready to my other hand, my pet-remember that. I shall not hesitate if you are disobedient. Rise now and turn, slowly, holding your dress up above your waist and come to me. I shall brook no hesitations now'.</p>
   <p>So saying, he retreated six or seven steps backwards and waited, admiring the luscious roseate glow on Mabel's plump derriere as she almost unwillingly bent and, slithering her feet about, turned until her eyes met the shadowy form of her sire, his trousers opened and his penis sticking out, so big, so big, much bigger than the dildo she had had.</p>
   <p>'Ow-wer!' Mabel stumbled at the sight and did indeed stumble as well over her ankle-binding drawers.</p>
   <p>'Take them, off, Mabel-I said take them off. Quickly now! Dress up and come to me, your belly bared, your muff on view'.</p>
   <p>Insisting to herself that she could not see the Priapic monster he was displaying to her, and insisting to herself as well that her fond parent could not really see more of her plump Venus mound as she raised one leg and then the other to shamefully divest herself of her drawers, Mabel slouched forward blindly, uttering in a little wail, 'Oh, what are you going to do, Papa?'</p>
   <p>'Nothing, my pet, but give you your just reward', he said and gathered her to him until her warm and trembling belly pressed against his upright cock and her blue-stockinged thighs came tight against his own.</p>

    <p>Chapter Twenty-One</p>
   </title>
   <p>Ssan seems disquieted, my dear, she is much flushed'.</p>
   <p>Mildred murmured thus to her brother upon finally making her appearance in the drawing room. Somehow the hours seemed to have passed without her being aware of it, and Susan had fled now to the bathroom from which much splashing was to be heard.</p>
   <p>'She is of an age, my dear-a superb young filly who will prove a splendid mount for some roguish fellow, I suppose'.</p>
   <p>'Really, Percy do not speak so of her'.</p>
   <p>Mildred's own disquiet and excitement rose in equal measure as his arms enfolded her waist, bringing her noble bottom firmly into his loins.</p>
   <p>'And pray why not? You toothsome darling, how fine and firm your adorable body is! Press your buttocks into me more-I adore them'.</p>
   <p>'Really, Percy, she may come down!'</p>
   <p>'Not for a while at least, my dear. Who knows what the morrow might bring-wars, disasters, famines? Would we not regret the absence of a pleasure we might otherwise have known? Disrobe quickly, for I would have you in this moment. Do you wear a corset, some impeding garment? No. Ah, how splendidly you are apparelled for the joust, my sweet. Just drawers and a chemise, or so I feel', the Vicar intoned, sweeping up her dress waist-high before Mildred could prevent him, even though her struggles proved wild in the process.</p>
   <p>'Stop it, Percy, I beg you! Not with Susan in the house- we must desist-AH! Oh, not my drawers, no! PERCY!'</p>
   <p>Wailing distractedly as her precious undergarment fell and her magnificent rear was bared, Mildred wrestled in vain at the fingers that tore her bodice open and exposed her tit to Percy's greedy palms. Knowingly he thumbed the thick brown nippies immediately, bringing them to rise almost instantly and therewith bringing a deep, expected flush into Mildred's face as she fought in vain to contain herself. Meanwhile, however, his free hand had cupped her furred slit and found, as he expected, an exuding moisture there.</p>
   <p>'Per-cee!' gritted Mildred in a moaning tone, but already she was half swooning with desire, her full tits swelling, hips wriggling. Half propelling, half carrying her and with the upper part of her dress falling from her shoulders so that in all effect she was naked above and below the waist, Percy bore her to the sofa whereon he had enjoyed Susan and with much twisting and wriggling on her part, got Mildred on to her back along the seat while effecting the freeing of his pego at the same time.</p>
   <p>Meanwhile upstairs, having stepped out of her bath, Susan had-with some alarm-heard the cries and squeals of her dear Mama who was at that very moment gazing up with puffed and flushed face at her brother's thrusting prick and balls.</p>
   <p>'No, don't Percy! You mustn't, Percy! OH!'</p>
   <p>This last cry wafted up to Susan's ears as, in falling upon Mildred, he levered her sturdy legs apart with some lustful ferocity and brought his stiff cock to nestle its head up between the rolled lips of her quim.</p>
   <p>'Obey me, woman!' Percy croaked and with one fell thrust was up her to the hilt, finding her cunny tighter than ever in her awkward posture and rubbing his swollen testicles under the bulge of her bottom.</p>
   <p>'Ah, you bad man!' Mildred moaned, though clutching her arms around his shoulders.</p>
   <p>So embedded in hairy pot, Percy as usual maintained his full sheathing while spattering her lips with kisses and sucking upon her tongue.</p>
   <p>'Gooo!' Mildred choked, for she was undone in every sense now and knew it. The huge pulsing of his swollen member brought her almost immediately to a pitch of amourous excitement, causing her fingernails to dig through his shirt.</p>
   <p>But to Susan up above, all sounded like an angry struggle and her conscience bit her. Her wicked uncle had perhaps exposed her secret to her fond Mama who was protesting thereat! Maybe he was even beating her! Her imagination thus running high-and little remembering the animal moans of pleasure that she herself had uttered in the process of being rammed-Susan wildly gathered a robe about her damp curves and threw open the bathroom door to hear the selfsame sounds. And how alarming did they sound to her ears!</p>
   <p>Whether Mildred heard Susan's nervous cry of 'Mama!' is never to be known. Suffice to say that Percy was by then beginning such powerful motions of his loins that were drawing both into a rage of lust. When but a minute later Mildred dimly perceived the stricken form of her daughter gazing down upon them, a first froglike croaking came from her followed by the broken cry of 'It is she!'</p>
   <p>Already feeling a deep tingling in his cock-which however he had schooled himself to contain-Percy turned his head and absorbed (not with too much surprise, it must be said) the wondrous vision of Susan with staring eyes and much flushed face, her body warm and scented from her bath.</p>
   <p>'Mama! How could you! OH!' Susan gasped and turned about, half-tripping as she made for the door.</p>
   <p>'Twas then that Mildred uttered the words she might long regret-and uttered them with no conscious reason at all.</p>
   <p>'Percy! Catch her!' she cried, as if by doing so he could wipe out her daughter's memory of the blissful and voluptuous scene.</p>
   <p>'HAH!' came her brother's glorying response. Unsheathing himself, cock-waggling and glistening, he raced after Susan and caught the girl at the foot of the stairs, so contriving to pull at her robe that in its loose descent from her shoulders she was left blissfully naked and uttering the wildest of screams at finding herself scooped up in his strong</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>arms and borne back into the drawing room, her long legs kicking and her cries resounding of 'MA-MA!'</p>
   <p>The room whirled for who then became three combatants. Finding herself laid upon her back on the rug, Susan flailed her arms and kicked much as a baby does amidst the resounding moans of Mildred of 'Don't, Percy-don't-I beg you, don't!'</p>
   <p>'Stop him, Mama! Gooo-ah!' Susan choked, for his ready pego found her notch the moment that Percy thrust himself between her legs and bore his hands upon her shoulders, holding her. Worming his swollen plum within her nest, he then snatched back both hands down and, scooping them beneath her knees, drew her legs up in such wise that Susan was helpless to prevent the insidious invasion of the further throbbing inches of his member which lodged so fully in her tight crevice that she was securely pinned.</p>
   <p>Mildred, having meanwhile staggered to her feet, groped the air in total disbelief as Percy immediately began to pump his niece.</p>
   <p>'Oh, dear heavens-what is to be! How can you!' Mildred howled, uttering a further and shriller screech as one of her brother's hands grabbed at her ankle and, with a twist, brought her bumping to the floor beside them while his penis shunted steadily.</p>
   <p>'Be quiet, Mildred, she must have it now. Kiss me!' he growled and ringed his arm about her neck, mashing his hungry mouth into her own while his buttocks rose and fell remorselessly, extorting with each stroke from Susan a soft cry of part delight and part bewilderment as the powerful penis shunted in her slit.</p>
   <p>'Dooo-dooo-dooo!' she whimpered, her bottom jolting and rolling as her uncle rammed her with strong, rhythmic strokes, his belly slapping down upon her own.</p>
   <p>'Pmffff!' Mildred was spluttering at the same time under Percy's mouth, but his trailing fingers had by then also found her juicy cunny and, excited as her clitoris already was, it responded vibrantly to his searching touch.</p>
   <p>'Ah, stop it, stop it, can't help, can't help!' Mildred whimpered pathetically under his mouth. The heel of his hand then artfully rubbed her quim, causing her legs to slip more and more apart.-'Soo-hoo-san!' she uttered while with a victorious grunt as he could feel the already responsive squeezing of his niece's slit, Percy removed his mouth from his sister's and twisted both their heads so that their lips came as if by hazard together.</p>
   <p>'Ma-ma-ma!' Susan moaned, her warm breath flooding her parent's mouth.</p>
   <p>'Fuck, my darlings, fuck-both of you. Let me see your tongues appear-both of you! You-Susan-knot your legs about my waist. You are receiving, girl, are being fucked at last'.</p>
   <p>Susan knotted her legs indeed and so tightly that she held her uncle in a clamp, but meet her mother's mouth she would not and, letting her head slip on to Mildred's shoulder, whimpered out her pleasure helplessly while Mildred stared up blindly at the ceiling, belly rippling and her legs a-jerk. The thumb that swirled over her erect clitoris caused her to expel in a shattering orgasm even as Susan experienced her own peak, feeling her tummy melting as she did.</p>
   <p>'Hah, you bitches, sprinkle, yes!' Percy gloried, quite beside himself. His own eruption beginning to boil in his balls, he eased his strokes and made them slower for the fill.-'I am coming in you, Susan, coming-feel it-ah!' he groaned and then expelled his spouting jets of sperm that left her lustrous cunny foaming at the brim till all legs slackened and all three lay still.</p>
   <p>In the dreamy haze that followed, Mildred twice feebly attempted to lift her shoulders but was gently pressed down again by Percy.</p>
   <p>'When I tell you, Mildred-when I tell you. I am still soaking in her delicious cunt, my love. Am I not, Susan? Is your puff well creamed?'</p>
   <p>'Mmmmmm…', Susan responded thickly and dreamily, partly to the wonder and partly to the jealousy of Mildred who felt now-and not without a certain truth-that she had assisted in the wicked act. As a gentle sluicing noise came to her, so Percy at last, and with some unwillingness, withdrew the long thick cork and let the head dangle lovingly around his niece's lovelips before he at last rolled from her, his nearest leg across her own so that she felt forbidden to rise.</p>
   <p>For a long moment a silence like unto a net hung over the trio and then the Vicar stirred and moved his leg.</p>
   <p>'I will have tea, Mildred. Prepare it, please'.</p>
   <p>Mildred sat up slowly in the manner of a mechanical doll that has half forgotten its movements and covered her face.</p>
   <p>'What have you done to us?' she wailed.</p>
   <p>'That which should be done and shall be done, my dear. Susan is not unsatisfied, I do believe'.</p>
   <p>'Go 'way!' Susan whimpered without conviction, throwing one arm across her face. Her cunny bubbled still. The tingling was exquisite there. It was, all her mother's fault, she thought, and did not stir as Mildred finally got up.</p>
   <p>'We shall leave this house. Come, Susan!' Mildred attempted with an air of conviction that fell completely flat.</p>
   <p>'You will get tea, my dear, and have no nonsense to it either, or I shall bring the tawse to you. Get on with it and be not long', Percy uttered in stern tones, though inwardly he was smiling with relief.</p>
   <p>'I hate you! Susan will hate you. Let the poor girl up that I may cover her'.</p>
   <p>'Begone, Mildred. I shall not give you another warning!'</p>
   <p>'Brute, oh you brute, Percy, I hate you-you have brought disgrace on all of us', sobbed Mildred (albeit without tears) and, thrusting down her rumpled dress as best as she was able, departed in order-as she thought of it-to put a better face on things. But with her exit, Susan also leapt with considerable agility to her feet while her uncle in his prone position admiringly watched the wobblings of her tits and bottom cheeks.</p>
   <p>'MA-MA!' Susan cried out as though in remorse and, naked as a babe, followed her mother into the kitchen where, with a little cry, they fell into each other's arms.</p>
   <p>The doors having all been left open, Percy listened languidly to the whispered conversation that then followed, Mildred first proclaiming that it was all her fault and Susan protesting the same. They would leave that very day, he heard Mildred declare though this brought naught but a murmur from Susan who cuddled her mother rather than otherwise, since she was the taller.</p>
   <p>Thus and thus was said that came to Percy's ears until finally he lumbered to his feet and, without disturbing the open gap in his black trousers, strode into the kitchen, whereat the two women gasped and clung to each other even more.</p>
   <p>'There will be rules, my pets. I shall fuck you both, occasionally apart, sometimes together. The tawse and the cane will monitor your behaviour here. The three of us will share one bed tonight-you hear? Or must I utter my authority in a much sterner wise?'</p>
   <p>Susan uttered such a little cry as she felt it was needful for her to do and kept her face averted from him while Mildred produced a single 'Percy!' and then was silent. An 'Oh!' escaped her and she concealed her face in turn.</p>
   <p>'That is better, my pets. There will be full pleasures here, I warrant that. Young girls, and mayhap some young men to tease your cunnies and your bottoms both. We shall take the country air, follow the streams, meander in the woods', said Percy in poetic mood. Fondly enough he moved towards the enfolded pair and began caressing both their bottoms, raising Mildred's dress anew until her belly pressed to Susan's and their thighs rubbed silkily.</p>
   <p>Both moaned, both murmured. Neither, though, objected to his touch.</p>

    <p>Chapter Twenty-Two</p>
   </title>
   <p>An hour had passed since Mr. Partridge had ridden out with Mabel and now from a high window at the front of the house, Vanessa watched their return. Mabel had her head hung, but no doubt she was rehearsing her entry into the house, expecting Vanessa's eyes to search her fully, as they would.</p>
   <p>To the relief and surprise of Mabel, however, Vanessa greeted the incoming pair with a soft 'Hello' and the announcement that, having expected their return at such a time, she had ordered tea to be ready in but a few minutes.</p>
   <p>'Thank you, my dear. Most considerate', uttered Eric with all the solemnity he could produce. Margaret had gone out, he heard, taking her nephews with her.</p>
   <p>'It is as well. I mean, that is, the house is nice and quiet. Alice wished to see my house. You don't mind? I despatched her there with a servant. No doubt she will be merrily frolicking all about-the little angel that she is. Did you have a good ride, Mabel?' Vanessa asked with perfect innocence while the blushing girl unpinned her hat.</p>
   <p>Swallowing, Mabel replied that it was nice and kept her head down as she spoke, averring that she wished to change.</p>
   <p>'No, dear, you may change later. Where did you go? Are there good rides about-around-about?'</p>
   <p>'We reached the woodman's hut and rested there awhile', Eric said. His eyes met Vanessa's, then he turned away.</p>
   <p>'Ah, then, you have something to tell me. Have you something to tell me? May I kiss her? How pretty her flushed cheeks look! Do you mind if I kiss her?'</p>
   <p>'I wish you…', Eric began and stopped. His voice was choked. 'I-er-I do not mind if you kiss her. That is to say…'</p>
   <p>'Oh, Papa!'</p>
   <p>Blushing to the neck, Mabel made to turn and make her exit again even as a maid entered to announce tea.</p>
   <p>'Later, I think. Do you think later, Mr. Partridge? Perhaps in an hour?' asked Vanessa pointedly while retaining a light grip on Mabel's arm.</p>
   <p>'Later, I think-yes'. He had a rigid look, and not only his face, as Vanessa saw.</p>
   <p>'We shall go up then-go up and talk-talk about your nice rest-shall we talk?' Vanessa purred.</p>
   <p>'I w… want, I want to change', blurted Mabel, clutching both hands together.</p>
   <p>'Darling, you are so babyish, are you not? You always want to do something other than that which must be done. If it has not already been done. Has it already been done?' Vanessa asked in one of her moods of repetition which seemed to hold small audiences in thrall.</p>
   <p>'Nothing, no. I don't know what you mean', Mabel swallowed. The little procession of three entered the hall and made the ascent and she could feel herself trembling in every limb, her body warm and vibrant as it had been for a short while, explosively, in the dark woodman's hut</p>
   <p>'Let me see you, darling. Did Papa spank you or even- I wonder-crop your bottom first? Have you taken that big cock of his yet-have you?'</p>
   <p>'Ah, no, stop it!' blurted Mabel, covering her face and sitting on the bed with a little thump.</p>
   <p>'She was good, though. Was she good?' Vanessa asked. Affording Mr. Partridge an encouraging wink, she placed herself on the bed on the far side of Mabel and looped one arm about her waist, bearing her back gently while Mabel's arms floundered and the back of her head hit the pillow.</p>
   <p>'She was good', came the simple reply from Mabel's sire who-taking the wink as a hint-moved round to the opposite side and so encased Mabel between them.</p>
   <p>'I do not have to cane you, then, Mabel, do I? Tell me, darling, for I wish to know'.</p>
   <p>'I want to die! I don't want to speak!' Mabel whined, keeping her hands over her eyes.</p>
   <p>'We shall see if you want to die when we have your drawers off, Mabel-if you are still wearing them. Are you?' Vanessa asked and with one sweep of her left arm scouted her hand deep up under Mabel's skirt and found the silky columns of her thighs and an absence there of legs of drawers. 'You left them in the woodman's shed, then? Good. You are progressing. Was he kind to you?'</p>
   <p>'He cropped my bottom! Oh, Papa, you did!' Two tears rolled down beneath her fingers and were kissed away by Vanessa's full lips. Bearing down on her slowly while inching up her skirt to rebellious scrabblings of her hands from Mabel, Vanessa eased one stockinged leg between the girl's.</p>
   <p>'Yes, but it was nice afterwards. Did you have a special ride then? Come, Mabel, do you want the cane?'</p>
   <p>'No-woh! He didn't, no! The awful wicked things you ask! Oh, go away! Let me get up, I will get up, I will!'</p>
   <p>'You will not, my pet, until I have the truth from you. Open her legs more, Mr. Partridge, while I draw her dress up more. Draw up her leg that's nearest to you-let me see'. And to fervent, strangled squeals from Mabel her brown-furred bush was all exposed and, while her trembling legs were held, a slender finger traced the gentle parting of her lovelips, Vanessa saying then with a small frown, 'I cannot tell'.</p>
   <p>'No, she was not, but almost', Eric quavered.</p>
   <p>'Aha, I see-she held your prick, you toyed with her? A good beginning, Mabel darling-very good. All right, sir, get your trousers down and let me see you both perform'.</p>
   <p>'Nah!' Mabel screeched and then received a slap across her thigh that made her sob, endeavouring to curl up, but she was held, her nearest leg gripped by Vanessa while Mr. Partridge rose and thrust his trousers down, raised up his shirt and showed his proud Priapus to their view.-'I won't, I won't. I won't!' Mabel sobbed, peeping through her fingers at the risen penis. It was true that she had held it, had her cunny felt, caressed. Her Papa had kissed her and their tongues had touched just for a moment, and then she had dropped her head away.</p>
   <p>'Shush! Be quiet now, Mabel, be quiet', Vanessa coaxed.</p>
   <p>Removing Mabel's coy hand from across her eyes, she swooped her lips down on the girl's and despite gurgling struggles and much would-be shaking of Mabel's head succeeded in calming her while Eric stroked her cunny and her thighs and let his pego throb against her stocking top.</p>
   <p>Mabel moaned and bucked her bottom mutinuously. Vanessa's long pointed tongue had found its way into her mouth. Fingers that were not Vanessa's were unbuttoning her corsage and her tits were freed. The tongue that slowly swirled in her mouth brought her a dizzy feeling that was like floating, floating. A thumb, that again was not Vanessa's, eased between her tight lovelips and moved back and forth, causing her-almost against her will-to draw upon it.</p>
   <p>'Gwooo!' Mabel gasped into Vanessa's mouth, bringing a pretty laugh from that lady who, glancing down for a moment, saw the urging movements of Mr. Partridge's thumb and then licked the tip of her tongue in a sweeping motion back and forth across Mabel's increasingly lax lips.</p>
   <p>'Hold it, Mabel-be good', Vanessa whispered into the girl's ear. Seeing that she made only a small, hesitant movement of her arm, Vanessa took her limp wrist and guided her hand down until Mabel's fingers touched the vibrant stem, causing Mr. Partridge to jerk in longing desire.-'I shall do it for you? There… clasp it but lightly, rub your fingers up and down… No, Mabel, do as I tell you-put them back. Up and down, up and down-that's right'.</p>
   <p>'I must!' groaned Eric who up to now had maintained what he felt to be a cautious silence.</p>
   <p>'In a while, my dear, in a while. Suck her nipples now and rub her cunny more. She is coming on, I believe. Are you, Mabel? Is your tummy melting, dear?'</p>
   <p>'Oh-wer!' came Mabel's moan. Clasping the throbbing member as she now was, her bottom rolled and wriggled on the coverlet more willingly, even raising her hips occasionally in more passionate encouragement to the urging thumb, while in his rising hunger of desire Eric rolled upon her bouncy young form, endeavouring to move Vanessa's face aside and to draw upon those succulent lips himself.</p>
   <p>Such abandonment of voluptuous preludes, however, annoyed Vanessa who reached between the bellies of the pair and grasped the fervent erection that Mabel, in the course of his movement, had been forced to loose.</p>
   <p>'Pray hold, my dear-wait! Raise your hips a little while I point your cock to her cunny. Mabel-draw your knees up-quickly, darling, now!'</p>
   <p>'I must, I must!' groaned Eric anew, but the hold around his charger was much more firm and possessive than Mabel's had been. Drawing his engorged crest to within a tempting inch of Mabel's warm, moist slit, she then began swirling a fingertip around the girl's clitoris at the same time.</p>
   <p>'Hooo-oh!' Mabel whined, the bucking of her hips causing her lovelips and frothy curls to rub against the velvet-nosed plum of her father's stiff penis, and so much so that Eric endeavoured to force her slit but was sternly withheld from that endeavour by Vanessa who frigged him gently but promisingly, even as she was doing to Mabel whose now ecstastic sprinkling was making Vanessa's fingers agreeably sticky.</p>
   <p>'How, sir, hold!' Vanessa hissed.</p>
   <p>'But I want…haaar!'</p>
   <p>Horrifyingly for Mr. Partridge, since he was within cunt-brushing distance, and yet with a whirling sense of relief, the first leaps of his sperm shot out, spattering both Mabel's honeypot and its shrouding curls in such abundance (followed as it was by its merrily-leaping fellows) that his daughter would not fail to feel the warm, splashing accolade. Indeed, in the fervent desire of the moment, whirling as she was in the course of her own delicious discharges, Mabel squirmed her hot bottom and endeavoured to sheathe the wicked member, but was prevented from doing so by Vanessa.</p>
   <p>'Glah!' choked Mr. Partridge, his sperm forming a thick, mucous pool over and around its intended target. His jaw sagged. He was all but spent, as Vanessa saw, and was on such a point of imminent weakness that his slippery poker was easily pushed further back until its final pearls dripped warmly upon Mabel's right thigh. With a groan of mingling</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>despair and satisfaction, he then subsided, bringing his weight to bear upon his daughter's mounding tits and belly while in his final frenetic jerkings his head lay beside her own, his cock issuing driblets still upon her silksoft skin.</p>
   <p>'You see?' Vanessa whispered with a smile to Mabel who lay limp and wondering, her eyes glazed as she continued to suffer the manly weight upon her. Mabel's parted lips were unmoving under the soft kiss she received while with one careful, nudging hand Vanessa caused Mabel's sire to glide off her.</p>
   <p>With a little cry then, Mabel rolled onto her hip upon the very edge of her bed and threw her arms about Vanessa much in the manner of a lost child.</p>
   <p>'Nice-is it not nice? It will be even better soon', her temptress murmured, stroking her nubile pupil's hair while Eric-guilt-ridden and yet containing within himself new fires of delight-groped his way off of the bed and quickly hauled his trousers up.</p>
   <p>Blinded as she was by the looming of Vanessa's face over her own, and now more eager for the kisses that wafted over her flushed face, Mabel did not see the flicking of her tutor's hand which sent Mr. Partridge shuffling without and in so much wondering that he could not believe what had transpired, nor-since it patently had-why Vanessa had not allowed him to complete the sensuous act.</p>
   <p>Pausing on the landing and undecided now as to how <emphasis>to </emphasis>act henceforth in respect of Mabel, or where indeed to take himself for the moment, he decided upon descending in order to quaff some restoring port or whiskey. Scarce had he begun to imbibe, however, and while reflecting on the perfect delights of Mabel's parted legs and snowy-mounded tits than Margaret made her entrance.</p>
   <p>It had been for her, perhaps, an even more perfect day than for Eric. Her bottom tingled agreeably still from the dual assaults it had received in a quiet pasture from both the boys who-somewhat shamefaced at the thought of encountering their father-had taken to the rear of the house.</p>
   <p>Unlike most adults, Margaret thought, boys in their youth did not allow their minds to linger upon acts of voluptuousness in which so far they showed much desiring effort but little finesse. It would be pleasant, for instance, to have her thighs licked, her bottom tickled by a teasing tongue, her nipples drawn upon more sensuously. With George and Freddy she was ever too hasty in the act, permitting their immediate, frolicsome pumpings of her bottom and her cunny. Even now their thoughts appeared to have moved elsewhere, for she could already hear the clickings of mallet and ball as they commenced a game of croquet on the lawn.</p>
   <p>So, too, did Alice who, having returned, came tripping down, asking whether she might play in the garden, too- though therewith giving her parent an exceedingly searching and much-flushed glance which Eric immediately misunderstood, of course, for he feared that she might know of that which it were better for her not to know.</p>
   <p>Receiving therefore his immediate and somewhat confused assent, Alice ran out, leaving Margaret to confront her brother-in-law who was in the act of handing her a glass of the selfsame comforter that he was imbibing.</p>
   <p>'Your, er…', Margaret began with wondering amusement.</p>
   <p>'My what?' echoed Eric.</p>
   <p>Swallowing a little at her own temerity, but emboldened by the events of the day, Margaret approached him more closely and after some evident hesitation on her part whispered, 'The front of your trousers, Eric. They are open. I fear that Alice saw your-er…'</p>
   <p>'My <emphasis>what?' </emphasis>jerked a confused Eric and then, glancing down, saw that the faintly-coated knob of his pego was indeed poking impudently out, for in his haste he had quite forgotten to button himself there.</p>
   <p>'Your thing', giggled Margaret who had not intended to giggle at all.</p>
   <p>'Margaret! Really!'</p>
   <p>Turning his back on her, Eric fumbled with his buttons, first issuing one into the wrong hole so that a blush of guilty embarrassment flooded his face.</p>
   <p>'My dear, I could not help but say it. How else was I to tell you?' Margaret enquired, holding the rim of her glass to her lips as though to prevent the exit of yet another giggle.-'Young girls are very impressionable, you know, Eric. Such things…'</p>
   <p>'My dear, you have no need to emphasise the matter', Eric uttered stiffly while in that moment his eyes wandered to the lithe figure of his younger daughter whom he could see through the window. The sunlight shone through her dress.</p>
   <p>'Forgive me!'</p>
   <p>Offering a sudden change of mood, which was more contrived than impulsive, Margaret turned her back on him and bowed her head, adding in a low and seemingly quavering tone, 'One becomes lonely sometimes, Eric. Words come to one's lips-thoughts enter one's head. I have never spoken thus before, but when Alice saw it… It was clear to see, you know. Like a bird peeping from a nest. Oh, but I should not have said that either, should I? I will be in disgrace with you forever'.</p>
   <p>As it appeared to Eric then, a sob-or what passed for one-came from his sister-in-law whose sumptuous bottom he had in full view.</p>
   <p>'That which you had to say, you had to say. If Alice perceived my…'</p>
   <p>'Your member?' asked Margaret softly, bowing her head while, with a sense of excited warmth, she felt his arm encircle her waist. One warm and bulbing halfmoon pressed back against his thigh. A quicker breathing sounded from both.-'What thoughts may be in her head now? Oh, Eric dear, how lewd you must think me for saying such, but yours is the first…'</p>
   <p>'That Alice has seen?'</p>
   <p>The words had escaped Eric's lips before he had thought to speak them.</p>
   <p>'Indeed, yes-but the first I have seen for so long. Can you ever forgive me for saying such? My boldness frightens me indeed, and yet…'</p>
   <p>'It arises from loneliness-loneliness, Margaret. What is to forgive, my dear? Do not distress yourself. Be comforted', uttered Eric in his newfound wisdom and therewith passing a comforting (if not also exploratory) hand around the protruding nether cheek whose companion moved a little to the pressure of his thigh.-'Perhaps, Margaret, we might retire upstairs and speak of it', he murmured, daring to feel right under her firm derriere at precisely the moment that Vanessa-who had overheard more of the conversation than either would have wished-strode into the room.</p>
   <p>'It is I who will arrange such tete-a-tetes. Is it not?' she asked so meaningfully that both flushed and stared at her, while Eric hastily stepped back.</p>
   <p>'We were discussing…', he began with wan hope of finding a suitable conclusion to his sentence.</p>
   <p>'Arrangements for the night? I have already made such. Are we not civilised? Do we not bring sensitivity to such? I shall spend a while with Margaret first, if I might stay'.</p>
   <p>'Oh yes, oh yes, an hour with me-of course!' interjected Margaret who otherwise feared that Vanessa's tongue might run too loose, as indeed did Eric.</p>
   <p>'May we drink to that? Shall we drink to that? It is not what people say, but what they do that matters-is it not?"</p>
   <p>'My dear Miss Markham, permit me to pour you some wine', stammered Eric.</p>
   <p>'I would prefer a sweet liqueur at the moment-just at the moment', Vanessa said and settled herself in a grey armchair with much regal swishing of her skirts.</p>
   <p>Just like a queen, thought Margaret with awe, and wondered what the night would really bring.</p>

    <p>Chapter Twenty-Three</p>
   </title>
   <p>'I had to come, ma'am. Tried to control them, I did, but there's been ructions. Wants to go back to their cottage, they do, and I has a job to control them and…'</p>
   <p>'Calm yourself, Mary. You did right to come', Vanessa said and gave the girl a benign smile as they stood together in the hall.</p>
   <p>'Interrupted your dinner, has I? I'm sorry, but I didn't know what to do'.</p>
   <p>'We are at coffee. You have interrupted nothing but my train of thought, and that for the best. Let them go, Mary. Indeed, you may oust them out. Tell them that I wish it, but that I may soon enough call upon their services again'.</p>
   <p>'Yes, ma'am, yes I will gladly. A bit of peace I'll have then, but I thought you was going to have more larks with them, that was what I thought'.</p>
   <p>'Larks there will be a-plenty, Mary. As Papa used to say to me each morning, life has just begun. Are you thirsty? Shall I have something brought for you? I fear though here that it will have to be in the servants' quarters. When I return we shall be much more homely again, shall we not?'</p>
   <p>'Are you coming back tomorrow, ma'am-are you?' Mary asked a little anxiously.</p>
   <p>'Of course, and I shall wish to find you warm in bed', Vanessa teased, though she held much fond tenderness for the girl.-'See to Reggie, won't you? I do not want him breaking out of a sudden all over the village. Have him bring his prettiest pupil to the house tomorrow, and then we shall have much fun, I am sure of that'.</p>
   <p>'Oooh yes, I'd love to do that. I'll tell him, shall I, tell him as you ordered it and that he must?'</p>
   <p>'Of course you shall-of course you must. Now be off, Mary, for I must not keep my hosts waiting. They are a very <emphasis>proper </emphasis>family, you know'.</p>
   <p>'Yes, I'm sure they are', Mary responded unthinkingly and then was gone again into the night, as Vanessa wished her to, for she had a few things to do yet.</p>
   <p>Returning to the dining room where all were seated still at table, she heard Alice asking, 'May I have a liqueur, Papa, may I? Miss Markham said that I might. May I?'</p>
   <p>'Miss Markham still says that you may, darling. Why, it brings a lovely warm feeling to the tummy, does it not, Mr. Partridge?' Vanessa challenged Eric who thereupon was forced to nod. Mabel sat demurely beside him, feeling now and then a hand stealing up her thigh and even inching her gown up to caress her knees. Apprehensions of the cane had left her… almost, but like Margaret and her own Papa she wondered still what the later night would bring. Every brushing of the insinuating fingers made her bottom wriggle.</p>
   <p>'Shall you-er-are you-er-teaching Alice yet?' Margaret asked, having nothing else to say but feeling quite a desperation to speak and wondering rather vaguely why her brother-in-law had only one arm upon the table.</p>
   <p>'I shall commence with Alice tomorrow-shall I not, Alice? What shall we do, do you think? Writing, reading and arithmetic? No, they are such dull things; we shall do something far more interesting, I am sure. But it is time for your bed and you, boys, too', Vanessa said in such a commanding fashion that, with a sheepish glance at Eric and Margaret, the four rose, uttering their goodnights in muffled fashion, though Fred and George glanced surreptitiously but with little hope towards their aunt.</p>
   <p>Alice, finishing her liqueur, rose last and ran to give her Papa a kiss, still wondering much at what she had seen peeping out from his trousers earlier that day. A peck on her aunt's cheek then, and she was gone while Mabel sat in great and tremulous tension while fingertips continued stroking the milky, swelling skin above her stocking tops.</p>
   <p>In the silence that followed the closing of the door, no one spoke for a moment. Regretfully, Eric slid his hand down from under Mabel's much ruffled skirt and resettled it on the table. Margaret yawned, covering her mouth delicately with her fingertips and then shaking her head as though to excuse herself.</p>
   <p>'You are tired, Margaret. Will you not to bed also? Shall I bring you something-something such as warm milk, perhaps?' asked Vanessa in all apparent seriousness but with such a hint of a twinkle in her eyes as Margaret could not fail to miss the allusion to that which she had already im-bided six times that day, though not by mouth.</p>
   <p>'If you would, my dear, if you would', responded Margaret who again felt herself drawn to the very edge of a horribly revealing conversation.</p>
   <p>'As soon as you are undressed then. And you, Mabel, shall I bring you something-something nice-as soon as you are undressed?'</p>
   <p>'Yes, Miss-if you wish, Miss', said Mabel meekly enough, whereupon Eric's hand immediately fell beneath the tablecloth again as Margaret rose and made her way out, as uncertain still of her fate as Mabel was, though she little doubted the insinuating message of the hand between her legs.</p>
   <p>'We shall all to bed, then. What a day we have had- riding and teaching, talking and learning', Margaret heard from Vanessa, but then the dining room door closed and only murmurings came to her. The light was dim in the hall. Some foolish maid must have turned the gas down too low and then forgotten it. She heard one of the bathroom doors banging and the sound of feet scurrying and sighed. The boys were so noisy-except when she cautioned then against discovery. The thought made her smile reminis-cently. Vanessa was such a strange young woman, and yet so sympathetic to her needs. How long could it all last, though-how long?</p>
   <p>Reaching the landing, which was no better lit than was the hallway below, Margaret glimpsed a dim, pale figure disappearing into a bedroom. George's and Freddy's room, she told herself vaguely, but then recalled that it was Hughie, and the naughty boy was obviously running around with all his clothes off. Rather nervously, Margaret hurried along to her own boudoir, intending for a moment to lock her door, but then remembering that Vanessa was to visit her, and besides, the key was gone. Vanessa must have taken it again.</p>
   <p>It was silent suddenly then, as if all the bedroom doors were closed and all slept-but that was a foolish fancy, Margaret told herself pettishly as she reached her arms back to unfasten her gown. In a moment, clad only in a waist corset and stockings, she began idly brushing her hair, remembering the events of the day and how they had begun when she had sat so before. But the boys would not dare to venture in now, at least. That was why it seemed so quiet perhaps.</p>
   <p>Eric had touched her bottom at last! The memory of that, too, returned to her. A quick vision of Alice danced across her mind, but was dismissed, as was that of Mabel who was equally an innocent. If Vanessa kept the key and if Eric visited her in the night… Margaret laid down her brush and toyed self-teasingly with her nipples at the thought. Was this, then, Vanessa's plan while she herself enjoyed Freddy and George-or even Hughie. It must not be Hughie, though. She did not want it to be Hughie. Her nipples stiffened quickly, but not at that thought, Margaret told herself faintly. One had wicked thoughts and did wicked things, but they must not be too wicked. Must they? Oh, this woman Vanessa was making her think too much, stirring up the devils in her mind too much.</p>
   <p>Rising unsteadily, her heavy tits wobbling and feeling all a-tingle at the tips, Margaret threw herself upon her back, rubbing her stockinged thighs together occasionally and stealing one hand down-half guiltily as she felt now-to finger her lovelips. There had been a night once-so long ago-when, in a darkened room and all tipsy, three men had fucked her one after the other and she had lain swimming in their manly juices until the first revived again and came upon her belly, urging in his cock again.</p>
   <p><emphasis>It was before I was married. Many naughty things happened before I was married. They make me wicked now, they do, </emphasis>Margaret thought as the ever-rolling reminiscences tumbled through her mind and her plump thighs parted the more and her finger grew even busier.</p>
   <p>Footsteps mounting the stairs came to her dimly, but she did not stir. Vanessa would guard her against interruptions. She had said she would, and she had kept her promise well that day…</p>
   <p>'Just your robe, Mabel. You will need no more than that. The juice will not be wasted on your belly tonight In with you now and quickly about it. I give you but ten minutes', Vanessa was murmuring to Mabel.</p>
   <p>'Yes', Mabel said. It had almost been 'but'. She had remembered in time not to say that. Words were being said that she had never heard before Miss Markham came. Her door closing, she raised her dress and looked at herself for the first time as she was-her thighs, the subtle curve of her belly, the inviting thatch beneath. Miss Markham said she was beautiful and had a lovely round, firm bottom and fine titties.</p>
   <p>'There will be many who will plunge their cocks between your nether cheeks, my sweet, and many others who will burrow in your cunny, too. Behave yourself tonight and wriggle well. You have already proved that you can do so, have you not?' Vanessa had asked.</p>
   <p>'You made me', Mabel had wanted to say, but then she had realised that Miss Markham knew about the woodman's hut, and that she had not been there to see she was obedient, so it wouldn't be true-not quite true, almost true, not quite.</p>
   <p>I don't want to learn, Mabel told herself pettishly, but even so took her dress off and then her chemise. She wasn't to wear drawers any more. Miss Markham had said so and taken them all away. There was a naughty tingling between her thighs. She almost wished there wasn't, and she sighed. She had to keep her bottom up at first, Miss Markham said, and afterwards she had to turn over on her back. Half dreamily, Mabel fingered her warm cunny and then withdrew her finger guiltily. It made her feel even more tingry, but in a few minutes, in a few minutes it wouldn't be her finger anymore.</p>
   <p>Her Papa would have a cane on his bed, Miss Markham had said. He would use it if necessary, she had said.</p>
   <p>'I do not want this fine little bottom of yours to work to the cane, but to the cock', Miss Markham had said, and Mabel wanted to cover her ears against that still intruding voice. But it was almost ten minutes now-almost, and the awful thing was that she wanted to now. It was going to feel ever so funny when he put it in but he almost had already- almost, yes. Donning her flimsy robe, Mabel put a moistened palm upon her doorhandle and turned it slowly, hesitantly, half fearing that Miss Markham was waiting without to guide her in. But Miss Markham had said she wouldn't- not if she were good.</p>
   <p>Mabel's bare feet on the carpet made no sound, but even so Vanessa, hidden in the darkness, smiled and heard her movements, heard the feint swish of her robe and her suddenly decisive opening of another door. There would be moans now-creakings of the bed-but no one else would hear. After the first explosions of that manly cock, Mabel would soon surrender to a second bout, though petulant she might pretend to be.</p>
   <p>Moving soundlessly back herself into her own room and casting off the single black robe she had quickly donned, Vanessa took a fine long feather from her bedside table. The tip was tickly, and it had to be. Margaret must be made to writhe.</p>
   <p>Making her exit again and taking care not to make a noise by closing her own door, which she left ajar, Vanessa noted with satisfaction that Hugh's was also as she had left it. The oiled hinges uttered no squeak as she peeped in and saw him sitting naked on his bed, his young cock fiercely up in flagpole style and a sheepish but expectant look upon his face.</p>
   <p>'In fifteen minutes, Hugh-you understand?' Vanessa whispered.</p>
   <p>Awed, Hugh gazed at her superb nudity and nodded. The waiting clock on his mantelpiece sent little arrows of sound into the room. If it were true what Miss Markham had told him… but then it must be, because she was undressed as well and he could see half of the fine bush of her Venus</p>
   <p>mound, the rest of it tauntingly concealed by the edge of the door. She was holding a long feather in her hand. He wondered why and what it was for.</p>
   <p>'Ten', Vanessa repeated and then drew his door to, but did not close it.</p>
   <p>The waiting silence from behind Margaret's far door pleased her. It would not last for long, though.</p>
   <p>After all, Margaret was going to get such a nice surprise…</p>
