<p><emphasis>The woman's muscles spasmed and as she
 floated towards consciousness she heard a man's
 voice, and what she heard made her want to
 scream and kick and thrash her arms. But she
 couldn't move. She had been drugged, she knew
 that. And the drugs held her paralysed. She
 could barely open her eyes a millimetre but it
 was enough to see what the man held in his hand
 and if she had been able to scream she would
 have ripped her lungs apart doing so.</emphasis></p>

<p><emphasis>The blade in the man's hands dipped and she
 could feel the flesh and muscles of her stomach
 parting. No pain. But she could feel it. She could
 see his head bending lower, his other hand
 reaching forth, reaching into her. Violating her.
 Then he stood back, holding a mass of tissue in
 his hand, blood dripping from it as if he was
 squeezing what he held. And she closed her eyes,
 willing it to stop. Suddenly she could feel the
 cool air, feel it lift the heat from her skin. As she
 sank deeper inside herself, she could picture that
 heat like a fine cloud of particles swirling up into
 the black inkiness of the night sky, separating,
 dissolving and lost to the universe.</emphasis></p>

<p><emphasis>And then she didn't feel anything at all.</emphasis></p>

<p>A group of noisy, enthusiastic young men gathered
 around one corner of the bar of the Unicorn, a mock-
 Tudor pub. A large-screen TV was commanding their
 attention. England was playing South Africa in a
 friendly and the atmosphere in the pub was rowdy,
 but not aggressive.</p>

<p>Detective Inspector Jack Delaney stood at the other
 end of the bar and waited patiently for the young
 man, with short cropped hair and arms like strings of
 rope and the word 'WRATH' tattooed in big, black
 letters along the length of one forearm, to get around
 to serving him. Any other day he would have been
 simmering with barely contained fury as the barman
 flirted with a couple of South African girls with hair
 as yellow as corn and strong, bright teeth. But Jack
 Delaney had other things to occupy his mind that
 night.</p>

<p>All things coalesce somewhere. All things come
 together in a pattern. He couldn't see it yet, but he
 knew it was there. Finding patterns was his job, after
 all, seeking what linked seemingly disassociated
 events. What Delaney did know just then, as he waited
 at the bar, with dark images flashing through his
 memory, was that he had a focus again. Something to
 help concentrate all the hurt and pain and anger he
 had lived with for four years into a single point of
 energy and use that to move forward out of the wreckage
 of his past, annihilating anything that got in his
 way. Jack Delaney didn't do standing still very well.</p>

<p>The barman's casual smile died as he approached
 Delaney.</p>

<p>'Help you?'</p>

<p>'Pint of Guinness and a pint of lager.'</p>

<p>Delaney threaded his way back through the crowd,
 smiling almost imperceptibly at the pair of blonde
 women, who were straining quite noticeably the
 yellow and green fabric of their 'Boks' rugby shirts,
 happy to draw attention to themselves. He put the
 drinks down on the table in front of his erstwhile
 boss who held a cigarette, as ever, in one hand and a
 lighter in the other.</p>

<p>Chief Inspector Diane Campbell looked up at him,
 a devil-may-care smile dancing in her puppy-brown
 eyes. 'Fifty-pound fine, it's almost worth lighting the
 bastard up.'</p>

<p>She held the cigarette aloft as if there may have
 been some doubt as to the identity of the illegitimate
 object.</p>

<p>Delaney pulled out a chair and sat down. 'True.'</p>

<p>'Meanwhile the fat cats of Westminster can smoke
 in their bar at the Houses of Parliament. Never mind
 their bleeding expenses, that's the real problem.'</p>

<p>'Not going political on me, are you, Diane?'</p>

<p>Campbell whipped her neck, flicking her bobbed
 hair left and right. 'Not in this lifetime.'</p>

<p>'Good to hear.'</p>

<p>Campbell looked at him for a moment, the
 mischief still in her eyes. 'I saw Kate Walker talking
 with you at the cemetery.'</p>

<p>'And?'</p>

<p>'Anything you want to tell me about that?'</p>

<p>Delaney took a long pull on his pint of Guinness
 and thought about it. Thought about Kate and her
 dark hair, her haunted eyes, her beauty. Her fragility.
 Remembering the hurt in her eyes as he had stood
 beneath the naked sky of a west London cemetery
 and told her that they had no future. He knew the
 damage that had been done to her as a child by her
 uncle, his ex-boss Superintendent Walker, knew that
 damage had scarred her as an adult, knew that that
 same uncle had tried to kill her because she was
 helping Delaney rescue his own child, Siobhan, from
 his clutches. Kate Walker had suffered enough, but
 he had made her suffer more. He'd already buried
 one wife, had carried the guilt of it for four years, and
 when it came to making a choice between the living
 and the dead . . .</p>

<p>He had chosen the dead.</p>

<p>He took another swallow of Guinness before
 putting the glass down and looking Campbell in the
 eye. 'Not a thing.'</p>

<p>'Wouldn't blame you if there was. She's got a fine
 figure on her for a brunette.'</p>

<p>Delaney didn't smile. 'We're about to put her uncle
 away for a long, long time, Diane. That's all I care
 about.' He leaned across the table and gripped his ex-boss's
 hand. His grip was firm, uncompromising, but
 she neither flinched nor sought to release herself from
 his hold. 'Just tell me what you've heard about my
 wife's death.'</p>

<p>She nodded, and Delaney released his grip. She
 resisted the temptation to rub her hand but held
 Delaney's gaze as he took another long pull on his
 pint of Guinness.</p>

<p>'Kevin Norrell.'</p>

<p>Delaney put his glass down, his voice arctic. 'What
 about him?'</p>

<p>The water fell like hard rain. The kind of powerful,
 punching rain you get in a tropical downpour. Kevin
 Norrell put his hand against the cool white tiles of
 the prison shower and felt it pound his body, the jets
 of water like needles. He bared his teeth. If he had
 his way the man who had put him in this prison was
 very shortly going to get him out. The water sounded
 like rain too as it spattered and puddled around his
 feet. He'd never liked the sound. It reminded him of
 his father, Sean Norrell. The memory, as ever,
 making his hand form involuntarily into a hamlike
 fist as his mind wandered back to his childhood, the
 summer of 1977 and the first time he was ever
 incarcerated.</p>

<p>The Hunter's Moon was a spit-and-sawdust pub
 halfway between West Harrow and Harrow on the
 Hill, set in a concrete housing development built in
 the sixties, complete with a small, built-in shopping
 precinct. The pub was at the end of a row of shops
 including a laundromat, a convenience store, an off-licence
 and a chemist. Three floors of council flats
 rose above the shops and pub, and were echoed on
 the opposite side of the street by four floors of
 similarly grey, utilitarian boxes. The Labour government's
 vision of utopian, urban living on the
 architect's drawing board may well have looked like
 a sunny vision of an ideal future; but whereas his
 green ink had imagined trees and benches and
 contented people, the stark concrete reality was inked
 in far more abrasive colours. The graffiti, though
 distinctly urban, certainly wasn't art, and couldn't be
 considered political, unless 'Jane fucks Ted' counted.
 You could lay money on the fact that the romantic
 dauber wasn't referring to Edward Heath and Jane
 Fonda.</p>

<p>It was raining. The kind of constant, wind-blown,
 swirling, miserable rain that clogged up drains and
 sewers, and it went with the soulless, plastic signboards
 above chain-link shutters, the sick, yellow
 light that leaked from the street lamps, and the
 garbage that floated on the street like rats go with
 sewage, or pigeons go with shit.</p>

<p>Half past eight on a cold November's night and the
 reality of the place was as far removed from the
 architect's sunny vision as Sean 'The Coat' Norrell
 was from a working grasp of quantum physics.</p>

<p>Inside the Hunter's Moon, the smoke hung heavy
 in the air, like a pale cloud. The lino on the floor was
 colourless and faded, but had once been red, presumably
 to hide bloodstains. The lights behind the
 bar were bright, though, as were the coloured lights
 in the jukebox that was pumping 'Float On' through
 crackling speakers that, like the rumpled person
 standing at the bar, had long since seen better days.
 He was a long-haired, fifty-year-old man with a knee-length,
 black leather coat. He scowled as he ran
 filthy, dirt-stained fingers through his greasy locks of
 hair and winked at the barmaid as he sang along with
 the record. He cupped his crotch with the other hand
 and bucked his hips forward in a crude, suggestive
 motion.</p>

<p>The barmaid had been in the job for well over
 thirty years and hadn't been impressed by much in
 the last twenty-nine years of it. Her low-cut top
 revealed a chest as smooth as corrugated cardboard,
 and her rasping voice held as much affection as a
 wheel clamp. 'I wouldn't touch your fucking cock,
 Sean, if I was wearing asbestos gloves.'</p>

<p>Norrell leered at her and gave a final thrust. 'Your
 loss, darling.'</p>

<p>'Sit down, and shut the fuck up, Norrell,' came a
 voice beside him.</p>

<p>Sean Norrell turned to say something but, when he
 saw who was standing next to him, the words died
 on his lips. He nodded a deferential smile and sat
 back on his stool, fumbling a cigarette nervously
 from a stained packet. He took a sip of his lager and
 scowled. Harp, thirty-two pence a pint now and it
 still tasted like cat's piss.</p>

<p>The man stood next to him was dressed in denim
 jeans, with a denim jacket, short blond hair and
 piercing, blue eyes. Mickey Ryan, thirty years old
 with a heart as cold as a Norwegian whore working
 al fresco. He looked at Norrell now with the kind of
 approval usually reserved for faecal matter
 discovered on footwear.</p>

<p>'You got my money?'</p>

<p>'It's in hand.'</p>

<p>Ryan's voice was level, dispassionate as he leaned
 down and glared in his eyes. 'Your dick will be in my
 left hand and I'll cut your fucking balls off with a
 rusty knife you haven't got it by Friday.' The barmaid
 smiled, approvingly.</p>

<p>'You take my gear you pay me for it.'</p>

<p>'I'm good for it, Mickey. You know that,' Norrell
 muttered.</p>

<p>But Mickey had already turned back to the
 barmaid. 'Double vodka.'</p>

<p>She fluttered her spider-leg eyelashes at him and
 smiled seductively. 'On the house.'</p>

<p>Ryan looked back at Norrell, his eyes like flint.
 'You still here?'</p>

<p>Norrell hastily swallowed his lager as Mickey
 Ryan picked up his drink and headed back to the
 pool table where a couple of nineteen-year-olds, in
 skintight hot pants and platforms shoes, waited for
 the territorial pat of his hand on their young backsides,
 marking ownership. He'd have liked to pick up
 a pool cue and smash it across Ryan's smug face. But
 as the blue-eyed man turned back to look at him
 pointedly, Norrell put his empty glass on the counter
 and scurried for the door. You didn't mess with
 Mickey Ryan. Not ever. Sean Norrell knew where to
 pick his fights and it wasn't at the Hunter's Moon.</p>

<p>He stepped out from the pub, blinking as the
 driving rain lashed his face and made his way across
 the street to the block of flats where he lived. He
 stumbled into the stairwell and held his hand against
 a concrete pillar to steady himself, and shake water
 rain from his long hair. He grunted and walked up
 the steps to his flat and fumbled his key into the lock
 of the faded red door of 13 Paradise Villas. They got
 that about right. Paradise in neon and street lamp.
 Nirvana by substance abuse. Heaven and hell in a
 fucking handcart.</p>

<p>He fumbled the door open and stumbled inside to
 domestic bliss. The theme tune to <emphasis>The Good Life</emphasis> was
 playing on the television, his runt of a son curled up
 on the stained, brown velour sofa watching it, his
 eyes fixed, not even glancing at him. Norrell's nose
 wrinkled at the smell of charred food.</p>

<p>'For fuck's sake, Linda. How fucking hard is it to
 cook a sausage?'</p>

<p>His wife, Linda Norrell, glared at him from the
 kitchen set off the small lounge. She was thirty-two
 but looked fifty, a sick fifty at that. Rail-thin, with
 straggly mousy hair that had, at some time, been
 dyed blonde, she was wearing a pair of tight, drainpipe
 jeans that made her legs look like sticks, a mauve
 shirt and a white tank top. The make-up on her face
 was applied with the delicacy of roadworks and did
 little to hide the bruising, or the emptiness, around
 her eyes. A cigarette dangled from tightly pursed lips
 as she flipped some sausages in a smoking pan, she
 looked across at her husband, expressionless for a
 moment, and then a light flickered somewhere in her
 eyes. 'Fuck you, Sean.'</p>

<p>On the sofa Kevin Norrell tensed. He knew what
 was about to happen next. On the television screen
 Barbara Good was telling her husband off for not
 wiping his wellies before coming into her kitchen. In
 his kitchen his father was slapping his wife openhanded
 across the mouth, opening up her lip to bleed
 afresh. Her screams of abuse mingled with his father
 shouting back at her, slapping the side of her head
 like a contrapuntal melody. And suddenly Kevin
 Norrell had had enough. Tom and Barbara Good
 might not have a television, but he did, and all he
 wanted to do was watch it.</p>

<p>The thin boy uncurled himself and stood up from
 the sofa. At school they called him Pencil Norrell. A
 gangly boy, tall for his age, his head disproportionately
 large, a head his neck seemed to struggle
 to hold up. Once of the older boys had stuck a
 condom over his head, and laughed as he almost
 suffocated. Pencil Norrell with a rubber top!</p>

<p>Kevin walked over to the kitchen table and picked
 up the almost empty bottle of cheap vodka that was
 stood on it. Lipstick marks smeared the spiralled
 glass at the top. He held it for a moment listening to
 the sound of his parents' invective mixing with the
 cutting bray of Tom Good's laugh. Then he smashed
 it against the wall. His parents stopped, and looked
 back at him astonished, their mouths agape like
 cartoon characters.</p>

<p>Sean Norrell was the first to find voice. 'What the
 fuck you think you're doing?'</p>

<p>And Kevin Norrell punched the jagged, broken
 bottle forward, as hard as he could, stabbing it into
 his father's thigh. Sean Norrell squealed like a snared
 rabbit and dropped to his knees, his hands cupping
 the wound, watching horrified as blood spilled
 through his spread fingers.</p>

<p>Thirty-two years later on and Norrell held up his own
 hand, letting the shower water run through his fingers,
 shaking his head as if to clear the memories.</p>

<p>His father hadn't died that night. The damage to
 his thigh was excruciating but treatable, an inch
 higher and it would have been his groin, the surgeon
 had pointed out, and that would have been a lot
 more serious. Sent home from hospital he managed
 to sell the remaining lump of cannabis resin he had
 left and pay Mickey Ryan most of what he owed him,
 not enough to save himself from a beating, mind, and
 the boys who gave him it laughed as they
 remembered that he had been nearly bottled in the
 nuts by his own son. They made sure to give him a
 kick or two in the groin before they were done. The
 kicking reopened the wound and Sean Norrell, rather
 than seeking medical attention, simply self-medicated
 with cheap whisky and strong lager and the wound
 became infected. He died some weeks later from
 septicaemia.</p>

<p>Norrell turned the shower off and wrapped his
 towel around himself. He had been in juvenile
 detention when he had heard the news of his father's
 death, and if he had shed a tear at the time it was
 certainly not through grief. As he left the shower
 block he nodded at a thickset man who occupied the
 cell next door to his. The man didn't meet his eye and
 Norrell knew it meant something. But he was ready.
 The time was long past when Kevin Norrell was
 going to be anybody's bitch. That interfering, bastard
 Irish copper was going to make sure of that.</p>

<p>Jack Delaney shrugged. 'So he's not happy where he
 is. Why should we give a monkey's toss?'</p>

<p>'He claims he knew nothing about Walker's paedophile
 activities. He fears for his safety at Bayfield.'</p>

<p>'The sooner that shite is put down like a rabid dog
 the better, you ask me.'</p>

<p>'Not too soon. Norrell claims to know something
 about your wife's death. That's his bargaining chip.
 He says he'll only speak to you.'</p>

<p>'And you'll let me do it?'</p>

<p>'I will if you're back on the force.' Diane dug into
 her pocket and pulled out an unopened letter. 'I never
 processed your resignation, Jack. Far as anyone
 knows you've been on extended leave these last
 weeks.' She smiled once more. 'Emotional problems.'</p>

<p>'You must have been pretty sure about me.'</p>

<p>Diane held the smile like a sniper cradles a rifle.
 'Men might not be to my taste, Jack. Doesn't stop me
 understanding them pretty damn well.'</p>

<p>Delaney finished his pint and stood up.</p>

<p>'Where are you going?'</p>

<p>'I'm going to talk to him.'</p>

<p>Campbell shook her head. 'Not today. I've
 arranged the interview for tomorrow morning. Come
 on, cowboy. Sit down, I'll get you another pint.'</p>

<p>Diane Campbell picked up his empty glass and
 headed for the bar, threading her way through the
 group of young men who had now started singing,
 'Get 'em down you Zulu warrior, get 'em down you
 Zulu chief.' She had never understood what the song
 was about, and the prospect of seeing a naked man,
 however young and fit, held as much attraction for
 her as a Cherry Cola held for Jack Delaney. She
 waited at the bar for the drinks and looked back at
 him. She had put her career on the line keeping him
 in his job. Bringing down Superintendent Walker,
 however guilty he might have been, had not
 enamoured Delaney to the senior brass. In fact she
 had to outright lie to the powers that be to keep him
 out of jail, let alone keep his warrant card. Possession
 of an unlicensed firearm was not looked upon with
 favour, not to mention the little matter of nearly
 killing one of her sergeants. That the sergeant in
 question, Eddie Bonner, helped to cover up Walker's
 activities was neither here nor there. Sergeant Bonner
 was dead and, whatever forensic pathologist Kate
 Walker might think, the dead did not make good
 witnesses. Diane handed the barmaid the correct
 change, flashed her a flirty smile then walked back to
 Delaney carrying the drinks carefully through the
 packed bar. It might very well come back and bite her
 on her bony arse, but she reckoned she had done the
 right thing. Delaney was a good man to have in her
 camp, she knew that much about him if little else.</p>

<p>Diane handed the Irishman his pint, spying the
 barely contained violence in brown eyes and figured
 Norrell better not be yanking on the cowboy's
 lariat.</p>

<p>Kevin lay on the top bunk in his cell squeezing an
 exercise ball, the tendons of his hand standing out
 like ropes of wire as he contracted it. The man below
 him fidgeted nervously. Norrell didn't blame him.
 Like the man in the shower, he wouldn't meet his
 eyes. Something was in the air. He could almost
 taste the tension. Norrell smiled humorously as he
 squeezed the ball again. Whatever it was he would
 be ready to meet it, or die trying. One way or another
 he was getting out of prison.</p>

<p>Diane Campbell glanced across at the pub windows,
 noticing that the rain had eased up a little. She sipped
 on her third glass of mineral water and looked across
 at Delaney. There was a glassy look in his eyes now,
 less anger and a softer focus. Not surprising since had
 moved on to drinking Scotch with his Guinness, for
 some reason insisting on Glenmorangie rather than
 his favoured Bushmills, and had had six or seven
 doubles. She wasn't sure that he hadn't slipped in a
 quick one or two when she had gone to the Ladies.
 Never mind about the ban on smoking in pubs, what
 about putting enough cubicles in and banning
 women from using the place like a lounge for gossip?
 She didn't envy a man his penis, that was for sure,
 but she did admire its functional practicality. She
 swallowed her drink. She was desperate for a
 cigarette. Diane looked at Delaney pointedly. 'Come
 on, cowboy, drink up. I'm taking you home.</p>

<p>Delaney looked at her steadily, the very faintest of
 slurs in his voice. 'I've got my car outside.'</p>

<p>'Yeah, and that's where it's staying. You're not
 causing anyone else's death this month. Not on my
 watch.'</p>

<p>Delaney laughed. 'Did you really just say "not on
 my watch", Diane?'</p>

<p>'You heard it, partner. The mule is staying parked
 right where you left it, and I'm taking you back to the
 High Chaparral.'</p>

<p>Delaney shook his head as he stood up. 'Just drop
 me off at a Tube station.'</p>

<p>'Which one?'</p>

<p>'Northern Line.' He drained his pint of Guinness,
 coaxed the last drop of whisky from his glass into his
 mouth and walked with her to the door. He was
 almost balanced.</p>

<p>*</p>

<p>Kate Walker didn't normally take the Tube. It wasn't
 so much that she was a snob, she just didn't like the
 crammed-in, close proximity of people. It wasn't just
 the look of them or the smell of them – which was
 bad enough with their wet, rain-sodden clothes – but
 she knew what people were capable of, the extent of
 their random cruelties. As a forensic pathologist she
 knew that far better than most. If she had learned the
 hard way that you couldn't trust the people you were
 related to or worked with . . . then you sure as hell
 couldn't trust strangers. She wouldn't be taking the
 Tube at all, in fact, but her car was booked in at
 the garage for a service and an MOT, and her
 mechanic wouldn't be dropping it back at her house
 until the early evening. So she had gone by train and
 taxi to the cemetery for the funeral earlier that
 afternoon of the caretaker who had been murdered in
 the course of Delaney's last case. She was pleased she
 had been able to take flowers for the grave, but in all
 other ways the journey had been wasted. She had
 hoped to be able to speak to Jack, discuss what
 happened with them, but she might as well have been
 speaking to the dead caretaker for the amount of
 emotional response she got from Delaney. The
 prospect of going straight home to an empty house
 had depressed her even more and so she had spent the
 rest of the afternoon shopping and buying nothing.
 Nothing fitted. Nothing was right. Nothing shifted
 the black cloud of her mood. And so here she was
 now, stuck on the Tube with a bunch of people she
 neither knew nor felt any inclination to know.</p>

<p>She looked down at her court shoes. Expensive,
 chic, sexy, she thought. Black suited her colouring.
 The shoes were now spattered with mud and rain and
 the shine had come off them, just like the shine had
 come off her day.</p>

<p>The train juddered to a halt, mid-tunnel, and the
 lights in the carriage flickered and dimmed before
 coming back up. She positioned her heel in one of
 the grooves that ran along the floor and swivelled
 her foot, wondering when they were going to update
 the trains. It took just over a couple of hours to get
 from Paris to St Pancras on the Eurostar fast link
 nowadays, but it could take an age just to go a few
 stops on this damned service. The lights dimmed
 again; low and yellow. Kate looked along the length
 of the carriage. There was something curiously
 Gothic about the Northern Line, she thought. Other
 lines, other stations had a late-Victorian sensibility
 to them, she knew that, but the Northern Line in
 places had a quintessentially spooky feel to it. Wood
 and brass and strange lamps, transportation by
 Hammer House of Horror.</p>

<p>The train shuddered and clanked as the wheels
 started turning again. She looked out of the window
 as the train flashed noisily through the tunnel once
 more and pulled her coat tight about her. It was early
 evening and the train was full, its motion, as it rocked
 from side to side, throwing the overweight man next
 to her against her body every time the train rounded
 a corner. He didn't seem too keen to move away,
 either, perfectly happy to invade her personal space.
 She sighed and gritted her teeth.</p>

<p>She was in a foul mood. Jack Delaney, the son of
 a bitch. She didn't know why she let him get to her,
 but he did. Kate Walker, in her own opinion, was, if
 anything, a woman born of logic, of reason. She was
 clinical, sharp; her judgement a precision instrument.
 Only that instrument was letting her down
 lately, and she didn't know how to fix it. She looked
 out of the window again, seeing her reflection
 smudgy and blurred, and that was exactly how she
 felt. Smudgy and blurred. She wasn't sure quite who
 she was any more. She leaned against the side of the
 train, putting as much space between her and the fat
 man as possible and felt a shiver run up her spine.
 Somebody was walking on her grave. Dancing on it.
 She looked around expecting to see someone
 watching her, but, if they were, they had looked
 away. Looking away was the English virtue after all.
 Never get involved, never show your emotions,
 never get off the boat. Maybe Jack Delaney was
 more English than he would have liked to admit.
 There was a man who was never going to get off
 the boat.</p>

<p>Delaney stood in the carriageway, swaying with the
 rhythm of the train, holding on to a strap hanger and
 keeping his balance, just about, as the train bucked
 and shifted under his feet as it rattled noisily through
 the underground tunnels.</p>

<p>He should have let Diane Campbell take him
 home, back to his sterile new house in Belsize Park.
 He should have left the pub after just one drink and
 then made a start on the decorating, making the place
 a home and not just a house. Somewhere where his
 daughter Siobhan would want to visit, would want to
 stay a few days with him. But Delaney didn't do one
 quick drink, and he hadn't wanted to go home, it
 didn't feel like home to him, nowhere had for a long
 time. Those dark thoughts hadn't been turned off yet
 and he didn't think they would. Not tonight. Tonight
 he needed more than alcohol to fight his demons.</p>

<p>He wished he had never visited the cemetery. He'd
 told Kate Walker that he'd only gone because he
 owed it to the old man who had taken a bullet for
 him. But it wasn't true. He'd gone to see her and now
 he wished he hadn't. It wasn't a time for complications.
 He had a focus now and he needed to keep
 that focus, but Kate had set a fire burning, created a
 physical thirst that he needed to quench.</p>

<p>A man leaned against him as the train turned a
 corner and Delaney looked back at him and the man
 quickly moved away, half muttering an apology and
 avoiding eye contact.</p>

<p>Delaney watched the man move through the
 crowded train, keen to put distance between them
 and Delaney didn't blame him. Tomorrow he was
 going to take steps. People were going to pay for
 what happened four years ago and pay in blood. But
 tonight he could taste the iron and copper in his
 mouth, could feel the murmurs in his blood like the
 low thrumming of a bass string. Tonight Delaney had
 another agenda.</p>

<p>He looked ahead, past the crowded-together commuters
 who were packed into the carriageway with
 the resigned look of cattle being herded to slaughter
 and as some stood up to disembark he saw the dark-haired
 woman. She was looking at her own reflection
 in the window as the train jolted and the lights
 dipped, yellow and sulphurous, so that Delaney's
 brown eyes smouldered in the low light like a hunting
 wolf's.</p>

<p>He came to a decision and reached into his pocket
 as the train clattered to a standstill.</p>

<p>Kate walked out of the Tube station scowling as the
 wind came howling up Hampstead High Street
 sweeping the rain into her face. She stepped back into
 the entrance and waited for the weather to abate. She
 looked at her watch, still not relishing the idea of
 going back to her empty house, but she had a film on
 DVD to watch and three-quarters of a bottle of
 Cloudy Bay chilling in her fridge. Damn Delaney, she
 thought for the hundredth time that day, wishing
 again, also for the hundredth time, that she'd never
 gone to the funeral. She tried to persuade herself that
 she'd gone for the old man, not on the off chance of
 seeing that ungrateful Irish bastard. She'd nearly put
 her life on the line to save his miserable skin, not to
 mention that of his daughter's, and what thanks did
 she get? Used and discarded. He made her feel like
 the cheap kind of whore he obviously felt
 comfortable with. She strode angrily out into the
 rain, sod the man, her life had been on hold for long
 enough. Time to push the play button, and not on the
 DVD machine. She hurried up the street towards the
 Holly Bush. Physician, heal thyself, that's what they
 said, didn't they? Well, she was going to write out a
 large prescription in her own name: vodka-based,
 repeat as required.</p>

<p>She crossed the street and, as she did, she felt that
 familiar tingle in her spine again, but, as she blinked
 the rainwater from her eyes and looked back, she
 couldn't see anyone following her. She hurried on up
 the slight hill, keeping her face down and angled
 away from the rain. Within minutes she was pulling
 the old, heavy door behind her, closing out the wind
 and the weather, the rainwater dripping from her
 black overcoat on to the rough wooden floor of the
 pub as she shook her hair and wiped a hand across
 her eyes, hoping her waterproof mascara was holding
 up and hearing the sweet, soulful tones of Madeleine
 Peyroux cutting across the chatter in the room. They
 didn't always have music playing; the manager said
 that the hubbub of conversation was the real music of
 the place and she agreed with him. It was just part of
 what made the pub special. Tonight though she was
 grateful for the music, it shielded her from other
 people's thoughts.</p>

<p>As she knew it would be, even this early, the pub
 was busy. She walked up to the right-hand bar where
 luckily there was a vacant stool. She pulled it
 forward, sat on it and smiled briefly at the young,
 Australian barman behind the counter. 'Large one
 please, Stuart.'</p>

<p>The barman nodded back at her, lifted up a jug of
 ready-made Bloody Mary and poured Kate a glass.
 Kate took a long pull, the sharp kick of vodka
 mingling with the bite of the pepper and the tang of
 the celery salt. She took another sip and sighed. Time
 to heal.</p>

<p>Janet Barnes had never had to work hard at soliciting
 admiring glances from men; her ex-boyfriend, a
 failed stand-up comic, said that she had the kind of
 body that pouted if it didn't get attention. Usually she
 enjoyed that attention, but tonight there was one
 man in particular who was looking at her from across
 half the length of the train carriage, and her skin
 crawled. She pulled her raincoat tight around her, but
 if anything it just accentuated her lush, curvy figure.
 She looked out of the window, the featureless rush of
 Victorian brick wall flickering past scant inches
 away. There was talk of London flooding in the news
 again. Steps being made to improve the Thames
 Barrier. She remembered the flooding of last year.
 Whole areas, families, homes, lives ruined in the
 North of England. She couldn't help wondering what
 would happen here if the Thames were to ever break
 its banks. The Underground system would be
 flooded. Thousands of tonnes of water would pour
 into the network. Would the passengers all be
 drowned or electrocuted? All those electric rails
 running everywhere. Another problem for that Eton-educated,
 class clown Boris Johnson to sort out. Not
 a problem for her, mind. Any luck and she'd be out
 of the miserable city long before that happened, if it
 ever did. Just a few more quid saved up, a few more
 months, get the winter over with and she'd be out of
 the capital, out of the country and over the
 mountains she'd fly to sunny bloody Spain. Put this
 miserable, sodding, rain-drenched country behind her
 once and for bloody good. Just because she dressed
 like a goth didn't mean she had to live like a bloody
 vampire, time for a change of image she reckoned.</p>

<p>Her double reflection in the windows, hovering over
 the flashing bricks, was smeared and bleary, a ghostly
 dull orange from the flickering lights in the tube
 carriage. She was sure, though, she could still make
 out the dark-haired man watching her. Good-looking,
 she supposed, but definitely something creepy about
 him, the way he stared at her when he thought she
 wasn't watching. She wouldn't be surprised if he was
 having a crafty hand shandy under the dark coat he
 was wearing. If she had a five-euro note for every time
 some man had accidentally brushed up against her in
 the crowded tube with a hard-on in his pants and a
 glassy look to his eyes she could have retired and
 moved to Spain years ago. She could have papered the
 road there and back with them.</p>

<p>The lights in the Northern Line tunnel brightened,
 and the train shuddered into Camden Town Tube
 station like a mechanical climax. She stood up and
 tightened the belt on her shiny, black, mid-thigh-length
 raincoat. She knew it did little to distract
 attention away from herself but didn't care. She was
 a living Betty Boop. People could look all they like. If
 they wanted to touch, however, that was a whole
 separate matter. A whole different negotiation.</p>

<p>She stood on the right of the escalator, some people
 packed around her and others rushing up the stairs to
 her left. God only knew what they were in such a
 hurry for, she thought. At the top of the stairs Janet
 flashed her Oyster card at the bored-looking
 Rastafarian who had opened the barrier, which had
 broken down again, and walked towards the left-hand
 exit, scowling as the wind blew the rain into her
 face. She turned back, certain she could feel the eyes
 of the dark-haired man, now lost in the steady throng
 of commuters, watching her still. Shaking off the
 thought she opened up her umbrella and walked out
 on to the pavement.</p>

<p>It was half past six and the streets were busy,
 people hustling to the warmth of pubs and
 restaurants, or pouring like a stream of wet ants into
 the shelter of the Underground. Janet walked away
 from the noise and the bustle of the main high street,
 and the clack of her sharp-heeled footsteps rang out
 as she walked along Kentish Town Road, fighting to
 keep control of her umbrella in the swirling wind.
 After a couple of hundred metres she was grateful to
 see the welcoming glow of light spilling from the
 windows of the Devonshire Arms. She folded her
 umbrella down, opened the door to the pub and
 stepped inside.</p>

<p>Since the closing of the Intrepid Fox in Wardour
 Street the Devonshire Arms was now regarded as
 London's Goth Central. Janet's jet-black hair, black
 skirt, leggings, T-shirt and make-up were about as
 unusual there as a pair of chinos and a striped shirt
 in All Bar One. In fact, some nights, if you weren't
 dressed all in black, you couldn't get in, and quite
 right too, Janet thought. There were plenty of places
 for the squares and the geeks and the city slickers to
 go to, places that would turn people dressed like her
 away. That was the thing about London: a place for
 every prejudice.</p>

<p>The lighting was low, and the pub was already
 busy. Janet had chosen it for the meet, for just that
 purpose. It was like a blind date, after all, and it was
 best to be prepared; in addition to the pack of
 condoms and the tube of lubricant that she carried in
 her handbag, she also had a small can of mace. She
 had smuggled it back illegally from a long weekend
 trip she had made to New York some months ago.
 Music was playing, muting the buzz of chatter that
 filled the air. The Velvet Underground. She ordered a
 bourbon from a bald-headed woman with multi-coloured
 tattoos snaking either side of her neck, and
 sat in the corner of the bar sipping it and watching
 people as she listened to the music. John Cale's viola
 screeched discordantly against the slow, hypnotic
 beat of the drums while Lou Reed sang about a
 woman not unlike herself. A girlchild dressed in
 black wearing boots of shiny leather.</p>

<p>The music stopped and Janet looked up as a dark-haired
 man approached. Hunger in his brown eyes
 and an amused smile playing on his soft red lips. She
 looked down at his snakeskin boots that had Cuban
 heels almost higher than hers, then looked back up at
 him and smiled herself, her painted lips opening to
 reveal white, perfect teeth.</p>

<p>'Hello, cowboy.'</p>

<p>Kate finished her second Bloody Mary. The two drinks
 had done little to lift her dark mood, but she was
 feeling just a little bit more numb. The edge had been
 taken off, and she was certainly warmer. She looked
 over at the rain lashing against the windowpanes and
 then looked at her watch, debating. It was only a short
 walk home, but she didn't want to go out in the filthy
 weather again. She held her glass out to the barman,
 who went to refill it, and slipped her jacket off,
 hanging it on a hook in the bar in front of her.</p>

<p>'You tried Nigella's?'</p>

<p>She turned round to see that a tall curly dark-haired
 man in his late thirties with brown eyes was
 talking to her.</p>

<p>'I'm sorry?'</p>

<p>'Nigella Lawson. Her recipe for Bloody Marys. It's
 very good.'</p>

<p>The barman handed Kate her drink and went off to
 add the charge to her tab.</p>

<p>'No, I don't think I have.' Kate turned back to her
 drink.</p>

<p>'Got to love a woman who puts Bloody Marys in
 the breakfast section of a cookbook.'</p>

<p>'I guess,' Kate said without looking at the stranger
 and sipped her drink. She wasn't in the mood for
 chit-chat.</p>

<p>Despite her blatant disinterest the man was not put
 off. He pulled out the recently vacated stool next to
 hers. 'Do you mind?'</p>

<p>Kate shrugged indifferently.</p>

<p>The man chuckled. 'Half a pint glass with half as
 much vodka as tomato juice. For breakfast! Like I
 say, you've got to admire the woman.'</p>

<p>Kate thought that if the woman cut down on her
 breakfasts a little it might not do her any harm. But
 maybe that's what men wanted. Meat on the bones.
 Well, she wasn't going to put on weight to imitate
 some quasi-Italian domestic goddess, however
 gorgeous she was. She realised the man had spoken to
 her again, but didn't have a clue what he had said.</p>

<p>'I'm sorry?'</p>

<p>'I asked . . . do you know what her secret is?'</p>

<p>Yes, she thought. She knew what her secret was all
 right. She looked like a woman of appetite. What was
 it you were supposed to be? A lady in the
 supermarket and a whore in the bedroom. Well,
 Nigella Lawson looked like Sophia Loren with a
 voice that oozed sex and sophistication in equally
 unfair measures. And could cook to boot. Bitch.</p>

<p>'I don't,' she said simply.</p>

<p>The man smiled. He had quite a nice smile. 'It's to
 add a dash of dry sherry.'</p>

<p>Kate nodded. 'They put a drop of red wine in them
 here.'</p>

<p>He smiled again. 'My name's Paul. Paul Archer.'</p>

<p>'Nice to meet you, Mr Archer.' Kate's voice was
 cordial, but cool.</p>

<p>The man held out his hand. 'Actually, it's Dr
 Archer.'</p>

<p>Kate hesitated then shook his hand. He had a firm
 confident grip, and his hand was dry and warm. She
 smiled and it didn't take much of an effort now. 'Kate
 Walker.'</p>

<p>'Well, Kate. Can I buy you a drink?'</p>

<p>Kate looked down at her glass, swirling the drink
 for a moment then downing it and placing the glass
 firmly back on the bar. Why not? she thought to
 herself. Why the bloody hell not?</p>

<p>Janet Barnes felt consciousness returning. Not suddenly,
 it was a struggle like crawling through treacle.
 Like waking from a long coma. Or nearly waking,
 that is. Flashes of memory fought to come through as
 she fell back into the nightmare she was struggling to
 escape. A train swaying off balance as it rattled along
 the spine of ancient rails that lay deep beneath an
 even more ancient city. She felt the eyes of men upon
 her. Eyes that peeled her clothes from her body.
 Sweating eyes. Hot, dry, hungry eyes. The sick yellow
 light of the train carriage wrapped itself around her
 again as she tried to raise herself to consciousness
 once more.</p>

<p>She had no idea where she was or how long she
 had been there. She moaned softly, the sigh escaping
 her lips like the last breath of a dying man. Her
 eyelids fluttered briefly, the orbs beneath darting
 back and forth under the fragile pink membrane, as
 images flashed through her cerebral cortex like the
 sparking of a badly wired circuit, and, as she drifted
 towards unconsciousness once more, she thought she
 heard snatches of conversation, a voice she almost
 recognised. She tried to latch on to the thought, but
 it was like a butterfly dancing out of her hands and
 high out of reach. Then her eyes stilled and the half-formed
 thought, and all others with it, floated away
 entirely as she fell back into oblivion.</p>

<empty-line /><empty-line /><p><strong>DAY ONE</strong></p>

<p>Six thirty and fog hung in the morning air like lowlying
 cloud.</p>

<p>Arnold Fraser shambled through the wet
 undergrowth on South Hampstead Common. He had
 spent the previous night huddled in the entrance to
 the local Tube station. In a different life he once had
 been a sergeant in the Royal Green Rifles, but he had
 come back from the first Gulf war with a shattered
 right femur and a broken mind. In a country that
 treats its old war heroes with pomp and ceremony
 every November and its returning soldiers rather less
 well, he ended up, like many of his comrades lucky
 enough to make it home, as an alcoholic, mentally ill
 and living on the cold and comfortless streets of
 London. Early commuters had disturbed his lager-fuelled
 sleep and he was setting out across the common
 to a homeless shelter where he could get a hot
 cup of tea and a moderately warm bacon sandwich.</p>

<p>His bladder full, he stopped to relieve himself
 against a tree, but even as he fumbled with his trouser
 zipper, hidden deep under many layers of shirts,
 jumpers and coats, he saw the body lying in the
 undergrowth near his feet, saw the unnatural pallor
 of her skin, alabaster against the black shine of her
 hair, and knew it for what it was. He had seen
 enough corpses in his days of service. He turned away
 and shuffled off. He'd learned that in the army as
 well. Never volunteer. Never get involved. He'd done
 that once for Queen and Country and what had he
 got for his troubles? Royally fucked over, that's
 what. He spat and limped onwards. Let the citizens
 deal with it.</p>

<p>Seven o'clock. Kevin Norrell was back in the
 communal shower room of Bayfield Prison. He took
 the towel from his waist, put it to one side and
 twisted the dial set into the wall, standing beneath the
 jets of water as he let them pummel his massive,
 chemically enhanced body and groaned in satisfaction.
 He had spent the last hour lifting weights in
 the prison gym. Being on remand had not affected his
 workout routines at all and he intended to leave in
 better physical condition than he entered. Having an
 office right across the road from a burger bar had
 helped put a layer of fat over the hard muscles of his
 stomach. But that fat was being quickly burned
 away, and with every bench press he had but a single
 thought in his mind. Kevin Norrell didn't intend
 spending much more time inside prison walls and to
 escape he needed to be moved to another, lower
 security facility. He grunted as he turned the heat up
 on the shower. He'd already made a start towards the
 road to freedom and this morning he'd take another
 step and it wouldn't be long before he was moved to
 the prison of his choice. He could practically
 guarantee it.</p>

<p>He poured some shower gel in his hand, his eyes
 flicking back and forth watchfully as he did so. It was
 a reflex you needed to develop in prison, if you wanted
 to survive, and if Kevin Norrell had learned one thing
 in all his time over the years in institutions and prisons
 it was that you never dropped your guard. Put it in the
 bank. You dropped your guard and you'd be fucked
 ten ways by Sunday. Especially in the shower. He
 continued soaping his body and let the powerful jets
 pummel the suds away, but he kept the shampoo from
 his hair, keeping his eyes clear. As he reached up to
 turn the shower off he felt, rather than saw, the three
 men who approached, moving on him fast now. He
 flailed out instinctively, slamming his ham-like fist
 sideways, crushing one man's throat and knocking
 him down before the others held his arm and two
 more came into the shower room. He felt himself
 being pushed to the floor, and charging foward he fell;
 landing on one knee in a toilet stall, he reached out,
 putting his arms around the stainless-steel base of the
 lidless toilet and gripping hard. One of the men
 pummelled his head with a heavy fist as the other
 kicked him viciously in the ribs, trying to dislodge him.
 He felt a rib crack. Norrell grunted with pain and
 anger and wrenched upward, tearing the bowl clear
 from the floor as his steroid-enhanced, brute strength
 ripped the screws free. He roared up, red-faced,
 furious with effort and smashed the bowl full into the
 face of the first man, the second slipping on the water
 that was now gushing from the exposed plumbing. He
 smashed the bowl again, turning the fallen man's head
 into a shapeless mass of blood and hair, and swung the
 bowl at the head of another man who was trying to
 escape, the man screamed like a frightened pig as the
 lavatory bowl smashed into his jaw, pulverising it.
 There were just two of his attackers left now but they
 backed off as he turned and snarled at them, holding
 the steel toilet bowl like the weapon of a demented,
 lavatorial gladiator. Norrell moved towards them but
 his right foot slipped on the wet floor and he dropped
 to his knee again, wincing with pain as his cracked rib
 flexed. One of the men jumped forward at him, a
 blade flashing in the brightness of the overhead lights,
 and a thin shaft of steel was punched hard into his
 ribcage. His other knee buckled and he dropped to the
 floor barely registering the shouts and cries of
 uniformed guards running into the room. His vision
 blurred and he struggled to draw air, his breath a
 painful, wet wheeze. He tried to raise himself up but
 those muscles that defined him in more senses than
 one, those muscles that had been built over years of
 dedicated and painful exercise, failed him at last. He
 slumped back on to the cold tiles like an exhausted
 walrus and as the blood pumped from his body, the
 room seemed to darken and the light, very slowly,
 faded from his eyes.</p>

<p>A muffled knocking sound brought Delaney groaning
 to consciousness. He half opened a gummed-up eye
 and cursed as a bright, white light stabbed into his
 sore optic nerves. He held an arm across his face and
 groaned again. As far he could tell, he was lying, fully
 dressed, on a cold concrete floor, but he had
 absolutely no idea where. A sharp pain lanced
 through the back of his skull as he tried to move, and
 he gasped out loud. He crinkled his eyes again to
 open them a merest crack. He was in a white room.
 Bare white walls, white ceiling and a painted concrete
 floor. A light bulb dangled overhead and there was a
 low, mechanical, murmuring hum coming from
 somewhere close by. Delaney's head felt like he had
 been hit by a heavy, blunt object, but he had no
 memory of it. He rolled to one side, wincing with
 pain, and slowly opened one eye again. As his vision
 blurred into near focus he could make out a chest
 freezer against the opposite wall from where he was
 lying. He realised that was where the humming was
 coming from. The knocking resumed and Delaney
 suddenly realised where he was. He had made it
 home, but only as far as his garage. He rolled over
 again, covering his eyes, and tried to ignore the
 knocking which was becoming more urgent now,
 snatches of memory coming back to him of the night
 that had just passed.</p>

<p>But the knocking persisted. Delaney stood up,
 wincing as the blood flowed through the sore and
 swollen areas of his brain and lurched to the garage
 door. He opened it, shielding his face against the
 sudden lash of wind and rain that spiralled in, and
 looked angrily over at the attractive young woman,
 dressed in a smart black suit, who was standing on
 his front doorstep.</p>

<p>'What the hell are you doing here, Sally?'</p>

<p>DC Sally Cartwright smiled at him, enthusiasm
 and energy radiating from her like a Ready Brek
 advert.</p>

<p>'The chief inspector thought—'</p>

<p>'She thought what?' Delaney barked. And regretted
 it immediately.</p>

<p>'She thought that you might like someone to drive
 you for your meeting with Norrell. She mentioned
 dropping you off at the Tube station last night.'</p>

<p>'Did she?'</p>

<p>Sally smiled again, innocently. 'She suspected you
 might not have gone straight home, sir.'</p>

<p>Delaney flapped his hand and gestured her in.
 '"Meeting", you make it sound like a bloody sales
 conference, and for God's sake, come in, Constable.'</p>

<p>Sally walked into the built-in garage, gratefully
 shutting the door on the wind and rain behind her.</p>

<p>'What the hell happened to summer?'</p>

<p>'Don't know, sir.'</p>

<p>'Come through.'</p>

<p>Delaney led her through the garage up a couple of
 small steps and into the kitchen that lay off it. It was
 almost as bare as the garage. White modern units, but
 nothing personal, no pictures or furniture. A kettle
 on the countertop. A couple of mugs. A whisky
 tumbler. Delaney opened some cupboards, scowled
 and shut them again. 'Have you got any Nurofen on
 you, Sally?'</p>

<p>She shook her head. 'Sorry, sir.'</p>

<p>'Co-codamol? Paracetamol? Aspirin? Anadin?
 Ibuprofen? Panadol?'</p>

<p>'Don't use them, sir.'</p>

<p>Delaney slammed a drawer shut, frustrated, and
 again regretted it. 'You'll learn,' he said, wincing.</p>

<p>'I've got a line of coke.'</p>

<p>Delaney looked across at her, half hopeful, and
 Sally laughed. 'Joking, sir.'</p>

<p>Delaney nodded. 'Not funny, Constable.' There
 was a time when Delaney had used the stuff, and not
 that long ago. Only a little dab now and again, mind,
 a wet tip of a finger's worth, to keep him sharp. But
 the business with Walker and Bonner had made him
 more circumspect. He'd never been a user. Whiskey
 was his drug of choice, even using the Scottish variety
 lately. And cigarettes of course. The day they made
 them illegal was the day he resigned for good. He
 fumbled in his pockets and pulled out a packet. 'You
 got a lighter, Sally?'</p>

<p>'You shouldn't smoke in the house, sir.'</p>

<p>'It's my goddamn house.'</p>

<p>'Exactly. And you want to keep it nice, sir.' She
 smiled, taking the edge of her words. 'For your
 daughter's sake.'</p>

<p>Delaney cursed and stuffed the packet back in his
 jacket pocket then sketched a hand in the air. 'What
 do you think of it?'</p>

<p>Sally smiled politely. 'Very minimalist.'</p>

<p>Delaney opened another cupboard and found a jar
 of coffee. 'Not got round to sorting it out yet.'</p>

<p>'How long have you been here?'</p>

<p>'A week.'</p>

<p>'Just a suggestion, but maybe some furniture.'</p>

<p>'You any idea what this cost?'</p>

<p>Sally shrugged. 'Three-bedroomed house, integral
 garage, Belsize Park? Way out of my league.'</p>

<p>'An arm and a fucking leg that's what it cost me.
 You want to investigate serious fraud, look into the
 price of property.'</p>

<p>'You don't have to tell me.'</p>

<p>Delaney found a couple of mugs and poured some
 coffee into them. 'Karl Marx had the right of the
 matter, I reckon.' He opened the integrated fridge
 and cursed. 'No frigging milk.'</p>

<p>Sally smiled. 'I'm all right anyway, sir.'</p>

<p>'Well, you bloody would be. We'll get one on the
 way. Just have a seat and look shiny. I won't be a
 minute.'</p>

<p>Delaney opened the door to the lounge. Sally went
 through to the lounge as Delaney headed upstairs. It
 was a large room with French windows leading on to
 a small courtyard garden. Like the kitchen the lounge
 was noticeably devoid of furniture, but there were
 some packing cases, one of which had a small
 television sitting on top of it. The walls were bare.
 The house, unlike its owner, was a blank canvas.</p>

<p>Sally sat on one of the packing cases and felt a
 spark of jealousy. A three-bedroomed house spitting
 distance from the station. Like she had said it was
 far more than her salary could afford, could ever
 afford looking at the way house prices had gone,
 never mind the recent fall. Ten per cent or twenty
 per cent off bleeding expensive was still way out of
 her league. She hoped Delaney got round to buying
 some furniture and making it a proper home soon,
 though. Criminal waste otherwise. Delaney had
 only bought the house, she knew, so that his young
 daughter, Siobhan, could visit him sometimes. After
 the death of his wife, Delaney's life had been such a
 train wreck that he didn't even have to think about
 it when his sister-in-law, Wendy, offered to look
 after his young girl. That was four years ago,
 though, his daughter was now seven years old, and
 the fact that Delaney had wanted to make a home
 for her with him, at least for some of the time, was
 a mark of how much he had changed, even in the
 little time she had known him. The poor girl had
 been through a lot recently, her aunt stabbed in her
 own home while Siobhan was held captive upstairs
 by his deranged ex-boss Superintendent Walker.
 Delaney and Kate Walker had arrived just in time to
 save them both; she shuddered at the thought of
 what might have happened if they hadn't. But
 Wendy had survived, though she had needed several
 weeks' recuperation in a private hospital and would
 be discharged soon. Perhaps Siobhan could get some
 stability back in her young life. Sally decided she
 would do her bit, she'd get Delaney to furnish his
 house properly if she had to drag him down to Ikea
 herself!</p>

<p>A short while later and Delaney was back
 downstairs. He'd had a shave, changed his shirt and
 put some eye drops in. He didn't look a million
 dollars she thought, but it was a vast improvement to
 the raw-eyed man who had greeted her at the garage
 door. A couple of hundred euros maybe.</p>

<p>'Come on, then.' Delaney led her back through the
 garage and out into the rain. He scowled up at the
 sky. 'What's the deal? We don't get autumn any
 more, it just goes straight from summer to winter.'</p>

<p>'Global warming, sir.'</p>

<p>'Global warming my arse. In the seventies they
 reckoned it was the Russians fucking about with the
 weather. But do you know what it's really down to,
 Detective Constable?'</p>

<p>'Sir?'</p>

<p>'England, Sally. That's what it's down to. God's
 punishing us, each and every one of us. And He's
 doing it by making us live in this shitehole of a
 country.'</p>

<p>Sally followed him out the door, not replying. She
 guessed some people just weren't morning persons.</p>

<p>The window was slightly open and the wind
 whistling outside knocked the blind against the
 wooden frame with an inconsistent rhythm. Kate
 woke slowly. Lifting one eyelid, she winced a little
 and closed it again. She murmured softly and turned
 on to her side. She reached out a hand and snaked her
 fingers through the man's curly hair and smiled.
 'Jack, wake up.'</p>

<p>She slid her hand down over his shoulder to tangle
 her fingers in his chest hair, only his skin was
 completely smooth. She frowned, puzzled for a
 moment, then her smile faded, her eyes shot open
 with realisation and she looked, horrified, at the
 naked man sleeping beside her in her bed.</p>

<p>'Shit!'</p>

<p>She turned over again and looked at the clock
 radio on her bedside cabinet. It was half past seven.
 She cursed again and tried to remember what had
 happened the night before. And couldn't.</p>

<p>'Shit.'</p>

<p>Quarter to eight and the rain was still falling,
 although lighter than it had been. Detective Inspector
 Jack Delaney and Detective Constable Sally
 Cartwright were stamping their feet as they stood
 outside 'Bab's Kebabs' burger van round the corner
 from the police station. Roy, the corpulent owner
 and chef, was flipping bacon on the hot griddle plate
 as Delaney and Sally sheltered from the persistent
 drizzle as much as they could under the awning.</p>

<p>'Point in case . . .' He pointed his egg slice at
 Delaney. 'What did you reckon of Madonna's
 "American Pie", Inspector?'</p>

<p>Delaney shrugged. 'I liked it.'</p>

<p>'Yeah, well, you would. My point exactly. Every
 man and his dog in the rest of the world thinks it's a
 piece of shit, but you like it.'</p>

<p>'It's a song, not a sacred cow. People should be
 more tolerant.'</p>

<p>Roy laughed. 'Ever heard of the pot and the
 kettle?' He fixed Delaney with a puzzled expression.
 'I heard you'd quit the job anyway.'</p>

<p>'I did.'</p>

<p>'What happened then?'</p>

<p>'Shit happened, Roy. You ought to know about
 that. And they needed me to clean it up. Only man
 for the job.'</p>

<p>Roy winked at Sally. 'And I bet you're right glad
 to have this little ray of bog-trotting sunshine
 back.'</p>

<p>Sally laughed. 'We're all glad.'</p>

<p>Roy shook his head. 'Yeah, well, I wouldn't be
 betting any large change on that.'</p>

<p>Delaney stirred some sugar in his coffee. 'You got
 that right.'</p>

<p>Sally took a sip of her herbal tea. 'Why?'</p>

<p>'He put down some of your own, Detective
 Constable. Never very popular thing to do.'</p>

<p>Delaney scowled at Roy. 'I didn't sign up for the
 police force to win popularity contests.'</p>

<p>Roy handed a bacon sandwich over the counter to
 him. 'Just watch your back is all I'm saying, cowboy.
 You put the Pied Piper away, doesn't mean there isn't
 more of the vermin that were on his payroll still on
 the job, scratching their feet and sniffing their noses
 in the air.' He looked pointedly across as a couple of
 uniforms approached.</p>

<p>Delaney took a bite out of his sandwich. 'I'll bear
 it in mind.' He turned back to Sally. 'Come on, let's
 get out of here.'</p>

<p>Roy called after him. 'Madonna? My doughnut
 more like!'</p>

<p>Delaney walked off, Sally took a couple of gulps of
 her tea and threw the cup in the black plastic dustbin
 at the side of the van. 'Cheers, Roy.'</p>

<p>'De nada. And you watch your back too, Detective
 Constable. That man is a disaster area in size ten
 brogues.'</p>

<p>Sally winked at him. 'At least you know where you
 are with him.'</p>

<p>Roy nodded. 'In fucking trouble most like.' Roy
 turned to the two uniformed constables who had
 arrived and were watching Sally hurry after Delaney
 with undisguised appreciation. Roy grunted at them.
 'Out of your league, boys. Out of your league.'</p>

<p>'Just give us a couple of bacon rolls, Roy.'</p>

<p>Roy leaned forward confidentially. 'Can I interest
 you lads in some pirate DVDs?'</p>

<p>The older uniform sighed patiently. 'Go on?'</p>

<p>'I've got <emphasis>Treasure Island</emphasis>, <emphasis>The Black Hawk</emphasis>, and of
 course <emphasis>Pirates of the Caribbean</emphasis>, the complete boxed
 set.'</p>

<p>Neither of the uniforms laughed.</p>

<p>Kate stood for a long while in the bathroom. The
 clothes she had been wearing last night were in a
 heap in the corner. She pulled the belt tight around
 the towelling robe she had on and looked at herself in
 the mirror. Her waterproof mascara had lived up to
 its name, but her eyeshadow and lipstick were
 smeared and her face looked pale against the almost
 black of her tangled and disarrayed curls. Whatever
 slight tan she might have picked up in the summer
 months seemed to have disappeared overnight. She
 walked across to the shower unit and put her hand
 on the tap. She held it there for a moment or two, the
 metal chill on her hand. And then she took it away
 again. She wouldn't shower that morning. She took
 the towelling robe off and carefully folded it, then
 picked up her clothing from the night before and
 dressed herself.</p>

<p>In 1903 Holloway Prison became a purely women-only
 facility. Coupled with the ending of transportation
 and the closing of Newgate, it meant a new
 prison for male offenders had to be built, a place to
 house those prisoners who were to be evicted to
 accommodate the fairer sex. The site chosen in the
 last, dying breaths of the Victorian era was a bit of
 undeveloped park and scrubland some two miles or
 so south of Hampstead Heath and a mile or so west
 of Delaney's new house in Belsize Park. Bayfield
 Prison was an all-categories facility that held up to
 six hundred prisoners. As the urban wealth of
 Hampstead and Belsize Park spread further out, the
 building was an incongruous intruder, a social blot
 on an increasingly upmarket landscape. But it lay
 hidden in its own ten acres of land, tall trees sheltering
 the place from view on the main road; it was still
 a lot closer, in many ways, to Kilburn than it was to
 Hampstead.</p>

<p>Sally pulled up at the iron gates that stood at the
 end of the long driveway and waited for the
 uniformed guard to check her identification. She
 wound her window down, flinching as the rain
 lashed at her face, and held her warrant card out. The
 guard grunted, monosyllabically, then waved her
 forward and signalled to the guard house. Electric
 motors whirred and the heavy iron gates swung open.
 Sally slipped the car in first gear and drove down
 through the gates and along the quarter-mile or so of
 private road that led up to the prison.</p>

<p>'What's Norrell got to say do you think, guv?'</p>

<p>Sally's question pulled Delaney out of his reverie.
 He had been thinking along the same lines. 'I've no
 idea.'</p>

<p>'You reckon he was involved in the petrol station
 hold-up?'</p>

<p>Delaney shook his head. 'Maybe, but who knows?
 If he was involved he'll have lived to regret it.'</p>

<p>Bayfield Prison, finished late in 1902, was three
 storeys high and had four wings on four sides, forming
 a central exercise area which could be monitored
 from observation posts on each corner. There were
 no windows on the exterior walls, which gave the
 brick building an imposing, severely functional
 look.</p>

<p>Sally pulled the car up to the parking area and they
 walked over to the visitors' entrance and, after the
 usual security checks, were shown through to a
 waiting area in the front of the prison. Delaney sat on
 an orange plastic chair bolted to a wall underneath a
 window, then stood up again and paced impatiently,
 looking out of the window and wishing he could fire
 up a cigarette. He kicked his shoe against the wall
 and looked at his watch. Ten past eight and way past
 time they should have seen Norrell.</p>

<p>He paced around the room for a minute more and
 had just decided to go and have a hard word with
 somebody when he heard the door open and looked
 across to see the warden walk in. Ron Cornwell was
 a tall man, six foot five but thin. He had pale blond
 hair and an apologetic smile on his face. 'Sorry,
 Inspector, I tried to get hold of you on your mobile
 earlier. And I've been held up on the telephone.'</p>

<p>Delaney walked over to him. 'What's going on?'</p>

<p>'You've had a wasted journey, I'm afraid.'</p>

<p>'What are you talking about?'</p>

<p>'Kevin Norrell was assaulted this morning. By
 some of his fellow prisoners. It was a very serious
 incident.'</p>

<p>'He's dead?'</p>

<p>The warden shook his head slightly. 'He's in
 intensive care in the South Hampstead up the road.
 He hasn't recovered consciousness.'</p>

<p>Sally joined Delaney. 'Comatose?'</p>

<p>The warden shrugged. 'Unconscious is all I know.'</p>

<p>'What's the prognosis?'</p>

<p>The warden spread his hands. 'I don't know; you'll
 have to talk to the hospital but it's probably too early
 to say.'</p>

<p>Delaney nodded. 'Who did it?'</p>

<p>'We're not exactly sure.'</p>

<p>Delaney glared at him. 'What the hell do you
 mean, you're not exactly sure?'</p>

<p>'All right, Inspector. Just calm it down, will you?
 Five men attacked him in the showers early this
 morning. He was knifed, hit his head badly. He lost
 a lot of blood.'</p>

<p>'Who were they?'</p>

<p>'We don't know who all of them were. Two of
 them got away.'</p>

<p>'How?' Delaney couldn't believe what he was
 hearing. 'This is supposed to be a secure prison for
 God's sake.'</p>

<p>'Three of the men were badly hurt by Norrell. Two
 of them are dead, the other is in intensive care.'</p>

<p>'And you've got no security footage?'</p>

<p>'The camera was taken out. That's why the two
 officers were dispatched. If they hadn't got there in
 time, Norrell would definitely be dead.'</p>

<p>'And they just let two of them walk away from it?'</p>

<p>'They were prioritised on dealing with the injured
 people.'</p>

<p>'Convenient.' Delaney couldn't keep the sarcasm
 from his voice.</p>

<p>'What exactly are you implying, Inspector?'</p>

<p>'What motivated the assault?'</p>

<p>'You know as well as I do, there could be any
 number of reasons. I have it on good authority that
 Norrell was involved in the manufacture and
 distribution of child pornography. Particularly nasty
 child pornography at that. You know what happens
 to people like that in prison if they're not in a
 segregated unit.'</p>

<p>'And why wasn't he in a segregated unit?'</p>

<p>'Because he wasn't charged with paedophile
 activities, Inspector, as you very well know. He was
 charged with murder and conspiracy to commit
 murder. He was a category-A prisoner and treated as
 such.'</p>

<p>'I want to talk to the guards who broke up the
 fight.'</p>

<p>'I'm afraid that won't be possible right away.'</p>

<p>'Why not? There's been a death, a serious assault.
 This is a police matter now.'</p>

<p>'And an investigation is under way. Your
 involvement will need to be officially sanctioned.' He
 shrugged, apologetically. 'At this moment it is out of
 both our hands.'</p>

<p>Delaney looked at him steadily. 'You know why I
 was due to speak to him?'</p>

<p>'I do. And I'm sorry.'</p>

<p>'Then you also know why I'm not going to just let
 this go?'</p>

<p>'Of course I do. And I want you to know that I will
 do everything in my power to help you, Inspector
 Delaney. Work with me on this.'</p>

<p>Delaney turned to Sally. 'Come on, Constable.'</p>

<p>'Sir.'</p>

<p>Delaney held the door open and turned back to the
 governor pointedly as Sally walked out. 'I'll be
 coming back. And in the meantime, you have my
 mobile number. You call me night or day you hear
 anything.'</p>

<p>'I <emphasis>am</emphasis> on your side, Inspector.'</p>

<p>Delaney held his gaze a moment longer and then
 left. The governor took off his glasses, running his
 hand over his brow, damp suddenly in the air-conditioned
 room.</p>

<p>*</p>

<p>Kate Walker shrugged out of her raincoat as she
 entered the suite of rooms and nodded distractedly to
 Lorraine Simons, her recently graduated assistant,
 who was still in the early days of training to become a
 forensic pathologist. She hung up the coat on an old
 wooden hatstand and walked past the trainee's desk,
 straight to her own office. She heard the young woman
 say something but had absolutely no idea what it was.
 She closed the door behind her, sat at her desk and,
 holding her head in her hands, cursed herself in a low
 whisper as she tried to put together a picture from the
 jigsaw pieces of memory from the night before.</p>

<p>She remembered travelling on the Tube, she
 remembered deciding to go to the Holly Bush rather
 than returning straight home, although now she
 wished to God she hadn't, she remembered having
 the first couple of Bloody Marys, and then she
 remembered chatting to the tall, handsome man in
 his late thirties, with dark curly hair and the kind of
 dark, come-to-bed eyes that were lately proving to be
 her undoing; but after that she had absolutely no
 memory whatsoever. It was a complete blank. She
 couldn't remember a damn thing from about eight
 thirty last night to waking up with a complete and
 total stranger in her bed at seven thirty that morning.
 And that wasn't something Kate Walker did. Ever.</p>

<p>She had shown the man, Paul Archer, out in the
 morning but had barely said ten words to him. Just
 hurried him out before closing the door on him,
 feeling the heat burn her face then as it was now as
 she shamefully tried to recall the previous night's
 events. Tried desperately hard, but failed absolutely.</p>

<p>The door to her office opened and Lorraine stuck
 her head round the corner. She was twenty-five, with
 strawberry-blonde hair, a body trim from cycling, a
 heart-shaped face, innocent eyes and the kind of
 optimism only found in the unworldly young or the
 terminally stupid.</p>

<p>'I was asking if you wanted any coffee, Dr Walker?
 I'm just about to make a trip to Starbucks.'</p>

<p>Kate found a smile from somewhere. 'Thanks,
 Lorraine, get us a hot chocolate and a croissant. And,
 please, it's Kate, not Dr Walker.'</p>

<p>Lorraine nodded. 'It's the weather for it. Don't
 know what happened to the summer.'</p>

<p>Kate smiled again, ironically. 'In our job you get to
 learn pretty fast that all things pass, Lorraine. All
 things end.'</p>

<p>Lorraine grimaced. 'Cheery thought.'</p>

<p>Kate flapped a dismissive hand at her. 'Go on, get
 the drinks.'</p>

<p>Lorraine closed the door behind her and as it did
 Kate's smile headed south faster than a penguin on a
 promise. She made a small fist of her right hand and
 put the nail of her thumb between her teeth. She
 deliberated for a second or two, then picked up the
 phone and rapidly tapped in some numbers. After a
 moment her call was answered. 'It's Kate,' she said
 quickly, needing to spill the words out. 'I think I've
 done something really stupid.'</p>

<p>She listened to the response, looking up at the
 ceiling. 'It's nothing like that. But I need to see you.'
 She looked through the glass window of her office to
 see Lorraine, bundled up against the cold, heading
 out the door and sighed. 'I need you to do some tests
 on me, Jane.'</p>

<p>'What kind of tests?' Jane Harrington's voice
 boomed, shocked, from the earpiece of her phone.
 Kate held it away from her ear then put it back and
 spoke into it, her voice a hoarse whisper. 'I think I
 might have been raped.'</p>

<p>South Hampstead Hospital was built, like many
 similar institutional buildings throughout the
 country, in the mid-Victorian era. In the year 1860 to
 be exact. It started life as a hospital for consumption
 and other diseases of the chest and much of the old
 Victorian architecture was still present, although new
 buildings had been attached over the years, most
 notably the teaching wing of the hospital which was
 inaugurated in 1904. The majority of the property
 was Grade II listed, now, which meant a lot of the
 offices and consulting rooms were poorly heated,
 relying on old, cast-iron radiators that the administration
 hadn't yet managed to justify the expense of
 replacing. What the rooms lost in terms of heat,
 however, was more than made up for in terms of
 ambience and in architectural charm.</p>

<p>Jane Harrington's office was a testament to clutter.
 The shelves lining her walls were jammed with
 books, with papers, with articles clipped from
 medical journals, with videos and DVDs and with a
 poorly tended ivy or two in inappropriate pots. Her
 equally cluttered desk sat beneath a bay window that
 looked out over a small quadrangle, at the far end of
 which stood the towered east wing of the original
 hospital. The windows were leaded lights, the desk
 was old oak and a visitor might be forgiven for
 imagining they were in the study of a don from one
 of the older colleges of Oxford or Cambridge.</p>

<p>Jane hung up her telephone, shocked at what she
 had heard. Kate Walker was more than just a dear
 friend, she was like a younger sister to her.</p>

<p>She drummed her fingers on her desk for a
 moment, then snatched up her telephone and pushed
 the button to connect with her administrative
 assistant. 'Adrian, it's Jane. Can you cancel my
 tutorials for this morning and rearrange as best you
 can? Thank you.'</p>

<p>She hung up again and looked out of the window
 at a group of nurses who were walking across the
 quad, their traditional black cloaks flapping in the
 wind like a storytelling of ravens. She always thought
 the collective noun rather odd. Less sinister, she
 supposed, than a murder of crows. The cloaks were
 originally coloured blue with the founding of the
 hospital, but with the death of Prince Albert they had
 been changed to black. Like the ties of Harrow
 schoolboys, the colour was originally only to last for
 a hundred years as a memorial to the German father
 of nine, but like the school, again, South Hampstead
 Hospital had stuck with it. Jane watched them
 thoughtfully as they walked out of sight, hurrying out
 of the persistent rain into the main part of the
 hospital. She came to a decision and picked up the
 telephone once more and punched in a number. 'I'd
 like to speak to Dr Caroline Akunin please.'</p>

<p>She waited for a moment while the call was put
 through. 'Caroline. It's Jane Harrington. Have you
 left for the frozen steppes yet or are you still on call
 as a police surgeon?' She listened and nodded tersely.
 'Good, I need a favour.'</p>

<p>*</p>

<p>The sight of a man's penis would not normally have
 alarmed Valerie Manners. She was a nurse after all
 and nearing retirement. She had seen more examples
 of the male reproductive organ than most women of
 her generation, even including those who had lived
 through the free love era of the sixties and the wife-swapping
 fad of the seventies. This one, however, was
 attached to a raggedy man, and although not
 impressive, was unpleasantly semi-priapic and being
 wagged in her general direction as she cut though the
 lower part of South Hampstead Common on her way
 home after a late shift at the hospital. Caught off
 guard, she ran off the path and through some trees
 and bushes into open grassland, running uphill and
 not looking back. She ran for three and a half minutes
 and then stopped, realising that she wasn't being
 followed. Panting for breath she leaned against a tree
 and willed her wildly beating heart to calm down. She
 berated herself for a fool, flashers weren't rapists.
 They might develop into rapists but at the flasher
 stage of their development they were usually
 harmless. She knew that much from reading American
 crime novels. She put her panicking down to tiredness
 and being too wired after far too may cups of coffee
 to get her though the night shift. She was getting too
 old to work nights, she told herself. Her breathing
 slowed eventually and as she smoothed down her
 rumpled uniform, a bird fluttered noisily up through
 the branches of a tree nearby, startling her again. She
 looked across at the undergrowth beneath the tree
 and something caught her eye. She moved a little
 nearer, tentatively, and bent down to have a closer
 look. When she saw what it was, Valerie Manners,
 who had been a nurse for more years than she
 remembered, who had always despised those trainees
 who fainted or screamed at the sight of blood and
 injury, screamed, backed against the tree, all colour
 drained from her face, and fainted.</p>

<p>Sally Cartwright spun the wheel, kicking up loose
 bits of gravel, and parked her car next door to a
 brand-new Land Rover Discovery. She turned to
 Delaney. 'You got any coins, sir?'</p>

<p>Delaney looked across at her puzzled. 'What for?'</p>

<p>'The parking meter.'</p>

<p>Delaney shook his head in disbelief and opened her
 glovebox and pulled out an <emphasis>on police business</emphasis> sign,
 which he put on the dashboard.</p>

<p>'Anybody clamps this car, Constable, and they'll
 have their bollocks as Adam's apples.'</p>

<p>'Yes, sir.'</p>

<p>Sally smiled and opened the door, looking up at the
 neo-Gothic splendour of the grand entrance to the
 South Hampstead Hospital. Delaney followed her
 glance, taking in the familiar sight. One thing the
 Victorians were good at. Hospitals and cemeteries.</p>

<p>They walked in through the main reception and
 headed towards the intensive care unit, or ICU; just
 like the acronyms with the Met, Delaney had trouble
 keeping up. Why they couldn't just stick with what
 people knew and what made sense, was a puzzle
 beyond the capabilities of his detective brain. Too
 many middle managers in unnecessary jobs, he
 suspected.</p>

<p>Sally followed him as he walked up the long
 sweeping staircase at the end of the corridor. The
 floor was cool, tiled and clean, but the smell of the
 place was just as every bit unpleasant to Delaney as it
 always had been. Even as a kid he had hated the smell
 of hospitals, the particular ethyl odours hanging in
 the air like an anaesthetist's gas. As a child it had
 reminded him of boring hours at sick relatives'
 bedsides, and of operations he had had, once for a
 broken wrist and another when a kidney was
 removed. But as an adult the smell reminded him of
 just one thing: the death of his wife. He strode
 forward purposefully as he reached the top of the
 staircase and turned left to the intensive care unit. At
 least now, maybe, if Norris survived, he could learn
 something about why his wife had had to die four
 years ago on that cold station forecourt in Pinner
 Green. He could finally learn who did it. And, more
 importantly, with that knowledge he could visit
 retribution on those responsible. It wouldn't ease the
 guilt he still felt over her death, nothing would do
 that, but the need to root out and hurt the people
 who had cut short her life was as powerful in him as
 the need for his lungs to draw breath and his heart to
 pump blood.</p>

<p>Since his mid-teens Kevin Norrell had been a
 larger-than-life character. Now, however, as Delaney
 looked down at his massive frame he looked as
 harmless as a beached and rotting whale. He nodded
 at the armed and uniformed police officer who stood
 on guard outside the intensive care room and turned
 to the young doctor who was adjusting a drip that
 protruded, like a number of others, from the
 comatose Norrell's arm. 'What's the prognosis?'</p>

<p>The junior doctor shrugged. 'He lost a lot of blood
 from the stabbing. He had to be resuscitated on the
 way into hospital and again on the operating table.'</p>

<p>Sally looked down at the grotesque figure on the
 bed. 'What does that mean?'</p>

<p>Delaney answered. 'It means his brain was
 deprived of oxygen for a while, he could be brain-damaged.'
 He turned back to the young doctor.
 'How bad is it?'</p>

<p>The junior doctor shrugged again. 'We'll wait and
 see. If he doesn't come round we'll do some more
 tests. Check his brain activity.'</p>

<p>'When will you know?'</p>

<p>'Check back later in the day.'</p>

<p>Delaney nodded. 'Can I see the other guy?'</p>

<p>'He's in surgery now. When he comes out you can
 see him. You won't be able to talk to him though, not
 for a while.'</p>

<p>Delaney and Sally walked back down the corridor,
 outside and across the car park to a small canteen
 that was run by volunteers to provide refreshment to
 the hospital visitors. It was a wooden A-frame and
 built like an alpine ski lodge, as incongruent in the
 rain-slashed English morning as a palm tree in
 Piccadilly.</p>

<p>Sally went inside while Delaney held back, taking
 advantage of a lull in the rain to spark up a cigarette.
 He drew deep on it, ignoring the disapproving
 glances from passers-by as he let out a stream of
 smoke. He felt conflicted. Ordinarily, seeing Norrell
 in intensive care would have brightened his mood.
 But the steroid-enhanced, bonehead muscle for hire
 had information stored somewhere within his
 Neolithic brain that Delaney needed. The thought
 that the man might die was almost too much for him
 to bear. Not when he was this close, not after so long.</p>

<p>He ground his cigarette under heel and went inside
 to join Sally who had brought a couple of teas over
 to a small table by the window. Inside the cafe was
 more like a scout hut, or the village hall from <emphasis>Dad's
 Army</emphasis>. Delaney sat down half expecting to see 'Dig
 for Victory' posters on the wall or 'Eat less Bread'.
 He took a sip of his tea, scowled and poured some
 sugar into it from a glass dispenser.</p>

<p>Sally looked at him for a moment. 'Do you want to
 talk about it?'</p>

<p>'Talk about what?'</p>

<p>'What happened that night?'</p>

<p>'No.'</p>

<p>Sally didn't answer him for a second. 'We were due
 to interview Norrell this morning, right?'</p>

<p>'Operative word being due.'</p>

<p>'In connection with the murder of your wife?'</p>

<p>'That's right.'</p>

<p>Sally seemed to steel herself. 'Well, the last time I
 looked, and with all due respect, sir, I'm a police
 detective. Not a waitress. Not a chauffeur. Not a
 dogsbody.'</p>

<p>Delaney waved a hand, a little amused by her
 angry tone. 'And the point would be?'</p>

<p>'That this is a police investigation, as you told the
 governor. And as far as I know I'm on your team,
 aren't I?'</p>

<p>Delaney looked at her for a moment then sighed.
 'I'm sure you know it all anyway.'</p>

<p>'Go on.'</p>

<p>'About four years ago. I was off duty. I stopped to
 fill up in a petrol station when it was being raided.
 They were armed with shotguns. My wife was in the
 car with me.'</p>

<p>'What happened?'</p>

<p>'One of them fired his sawn-off, shattering the
 plate window. I jumped in the car and attempted to
 follow them. They shot back at us. Disabling the car.
 Killing my wife.'</p>

<p>'I'm sorry.'</p>

<p>Delaney nodded. 'As I said, you've heard it all
 before. We were never able to trace the van, we never
 found out the identity of the raiders. It was a closed
 book. A cold case. And then Norrell started talking
 about it.'</p>

<p>'You think he was genuine? You really think he
 knew something?'</p>

<p>Delaney shrugged his shoulders. 'I hope so. I hope
 he lives long enough for us to find out.'</p>

<p>He looked out of the window; the wind had picked
 up again and with it the rain. Fat beads of water were
 splashing repeatedly and loudly against the glass of
 the window, running quickly down the pane now.
 Delaney turned back to Sally Cartwright.</p>

<p>'I'm going outside for another smoke.'</p>

<p>Kate walked across the quadrangle. Her head was
 angled down, her eyes squinting against the rain.
 She looked at her shoes, getting more spattered and
 besmirched by the minute, but she barely registered
 the fact. Still numb, her mind still reeling, she
 walked in a daze, not noticing her friend waving to
 her through the window of her office or the man at
 the far end of the quadrangle who was watching
 her.</p>

<p>She crossed the quad and walked into the entrance,
 shaking her hair as she hurried up the stone steps to
 the first floor. Jane Harrington ushered her into her
 office, making sympathetic noises about being wet
 through and helping her out of her coat as she shut
 the door behind her. 'Sit down, Kate. I'll make some
 tea. Are you hungry? Can I get you anything?'</p>

<p>Kate shook her head. 'Just tea would be great.' She
 smiled gratefully, pleased that her friend was letting
 her take her time and hadn't demanded to know what
 had happened straight away. If she could have
 answered that question she wouldn't be here in the
 first place. Jane had been her friend for many years. In
 her forties she was older than her and wiser than most.
 She had been pestering her for years to join her in
 private practice at the teaching hospital and clinic
 attached to the university, but Kate had always had
 different ambitions, a different agenda. Now, as she
 sat cocooned in an armchair behind mullioned windows,
 she was not sure she had made the right choices.
 But what she did know was that she didn't know
 anyone she would rather turn to if she ever needed
 help. And if she ever needed help, it was certainly now.</p>

<p>A short while later Jane handed her a mug of
 strong, sweet tea and sat opposite her.</p>

<p>'Ready to talk about it?'</p>

<p>'I don't know what happened, Jane.' Her voice was
 strained, she felt on the verge of tears.</p>

<p>'Then tell me what you do know.'</p>

<p>'I was at the Holly Bush. Taking a swim in a bottle
 of vodka.'</p>

<p>'That's not like you.'</p>

<p>'I met Jack yesterday.'</p>

<p>Jane nodded understanding. 'It didn't go well?'</p>

<p>Kate shook her head. 'I decided to drown my
 sorrows. Bad enough to get dumped by the man.
 Now I'm turning into him.'</p>

<p>Jane smiled sympathetically. 'Go on.'</p>

<p>'I got chatting to a man at the bar. He'd started
 talking to me. I didn't think he was trying to pick me
 up.'</p>

<p>Jane Harrington frowned.</p>

<p>'Yeah, I know, you don't have to say it. His name
 is Archer. He's a doctor so I thought I could trust him
 for goodness' sake.'</p>

<p>Jane reacted at the name. 'Paul Archer?'</p>

<p>Kate looked up, surprised. 'Do you know him?'</p>

<p>Jane jerked her thumb at the window. 'He works
 here. He's a paediatrician.'</p>

<p>'What do you know about him?'</p>

<p>'I know he has a reputation.'</p>

<p>'Reputation for what?'</p>

<p>'As a ladies' man. He's married but it doesn't stop
 him apparently.'</p>

<p>Kate put her head in her hands. 'Shit.'</p>

<p>'Or didn't stop him, I should say. His wife's
 divorcing him.'</p>

<p>'What am I going to do, Jane?'</p>

<p>'Tell me exactly what happened.'</p>

<p>Kate stood up angrily. 'That's just it, I don't know
 what happened. I don't remember leaving the pub, I
 don't remember going home. I remember being in the
 pub, listening to Madeleine Peyroux, drinking
 Bloody Marys, talking to Paul Archer and the next
 thing I remember is waking up in my bed at seven
 thirty this morning, bare as a jaybird with a stark
 bollock naked man lying beside me.'</p>

<p>'Dr Archer?'</p>

<p>'Yes, Dr bloody Archer.' She sat down again and
 looked at her friend with sore, bloodshot and
 devastated eyes. 'I think he raped me, Jane. I think he
 slipped some Rohypnol, or something like it, in my
 drink and he raped me.'</p>

<p>Jane took her friend's hand and held it as tears ran
 down her cheek. 'It's going to be okay, Kate. We're
 going to find out what happened and if he has done
 what you say, then we are going to make him pay for
 it.'</p>

<p>'But if I can't remember . . . ?'</p>

<p>'The first thing we are going to do is take a blood
 test. See if there is anything in your system.'</p>

<p>'And then what?'</p>

<p>'I've asked Dr Caroline Akunin to come over here.'</p>

<p>Kate looked up agitated. 'No, Jane. I don't want
 that.'</p>

<p>'You haven't showered, have you?'</p>

<p>Kate shook her head.</p>

<p>'So you must have had it in mind.'</p>

<p>'I don't want to go to the police. I can't.'</p>

<p>'That's why I asked her to come here.'</p>

<p>Kate held her head in her hands again. 'I've
 performed the procedures often enough in the past.
 Feeling sorry for the women. Pitying them. Christ,
 Jane, I never thought I'd be in their shoes.'</p>

<p>Jane took her hand again. 'You're not at fault here,
 Kate.'</p>

<p>'Aren't I? I went out and got smashed. Maybe I did
 want to act like Jack. Wash my problems away in a
 lake of alcohol, have meaningless, emotionless sex.'</p>

<p>Jane shook her head. 'Are you saying this is what
 you wanted?'</p>

<p>'If it's what I wanted, I would have remembered,
 wouldn't I?'</p>

<p>Dr Caroline Akunin was a stunningly beautiful, black
 woman in her late thirties. She was tall, elegant,
 shaved her hair and was seven months pregnant. She
 looked sympathetically at Kate as Jane Harrington
 closed the door behind her office, leaving the two
 women alone.</p>

<p>Kate nodded at the doctor's swollen belly. 'Nearly
 due then?'</p>

<p>Caroline ran her hand instinctively across her
 bump. 'How can you tell? A couple of months to go.'</p>

<p>'And how's your gorgeous husband?'</p>

<p>'My gorgeous husband is being a pain in the butt
 right now.'</p>

<p>'Why?'</p>

<p>'He wants this little one to be born back in his own
 country.'</p>

<p>'Russia?'</p>

<p>'Yup. Moscow, just where I want to be in the
 middle of winter.'</p>

<p>'Will you go?'</p>

<p>Caroline smiled, the brilliance of it lighting the
 room. 'I don't mind really. Quite looking forward to
 it. Never let him know though. You have to keep
 your man on his toes, don't you?'</p>

<p>Kate looked away. 'I guess.'</p>

<p>'I'm sorry, Kate.'</p>

<p>Kate put her hand on her arm. 'That's okay. Let's
 just get on with this.'</p>

<p>Caroline nodded sympathetically. 'We should
 really do this back at the station.'</p>

<p>'White City?'</p>

<p>'Yes.'</p>

<p>'You can't be serious?'</p>

<p>'Any evidence I collect here won't be admissible in
 court, you do know that?'</p>

<p>'I know, Caroline. But I can't go there. Not with
 this.'</p>

<p>'You wouldn't be the first.'</p>

<p>'I just want to know what happened. After that . . .'
 Kate shrugged. She had absolutely no idea what she
 would do if her fears were confirmed.</p>

<p>Dr Akunin opened up her medical bag, took out
 some plastic bags and a pair of latex gloves. She
 pulled the gloves on, snapping the latex tight to her
 fingers. 'You'd better get undressed then.'</p>

<p>PC Bob Wilkinson scowled as he looked down at the
 body that lay barely hidden in the undergrowth. He
 sighed, unclipped his police radio from its holster and
 he shared a look with his colleague, a young, black
 constable called Danny Vine. The boy was ashen, he
 looked down at what lay on the ground and then
 dashed off to the bushes to be violently sick.</p>

<p>'Foxtrot Alpha from thirty-two.'</p>

<p>His police radio crackled. 'Go ahead, Bob.'</p>

<p>Wilkinson looked over at his colleague who had
 stood up and was now wiping the blue serge of his
 uniformed arm across his mouth. He felt sorry for
 him, you never got used to it, though, even after
 nearly thirty years. 'We have an IC1 female. Somewhere
 in her twenties.' He paused. 'It's not an
 accidental death.'</p>

<p>Kate stood in the centre of the white cotton sheet that
 Caroline had spread on the floor. The doctor was on
 her knees in front of Kate with a comb in her hand.
 Kate looked away as she worked, carefully placing
 the combed hairs in a small, clear plastic bag.</p>

<p>'When was the last time you had consensual sex,
 Kate?'</p>

<p>Her memory flashed back to around three weeks
 ago. She had no trouble recalling that.</p>

<p>Jack Delaney.</p>

<p><emphasis>'Tell me, Jack. Talk to me.' Low, breathless,
 husky.</emphasis></p>

<p><emphasis>'Dig your nails in. I want to taste blood.'</emphasis></p>

<p><emphasis>'Pleasure and pain, Detective Inspector. Very
 Catholic.'</emphasis></p>

<p><emphasis>Delaney laughed, looking into her eyes, at the
 mischief sparking within them. 'I want to
 remember the moment.'</emphasis></p>

<p><emphasis>And Kate dug her nails into his buttocks,
 pulling him deeper into her. 'Oh, you'll remember.
 I'll make sure of that.'</emphasis></p>

<p>She remembered the savagery of their lovemaking.
 Remembered him on top of her, penetrating her
 almost painfully, his powerful arms clutching her
 tight to his muscular body like a life raft as he rode
 the waves of their passion. She remembered his soft
 eyes wet with emotion as he shuddered to a climax,
 taking her with him. She remembered the absolute
 nakedness of his emotions as he held on too long
 afterwards, kissing her salty shoulder and whispering
 her name like a prayer.</p>

<p>And she remembered the love she felt for him.</p>

<p>She looked over at the curtained window and felt
 tears running down her cheeks again.</p>

<p>Caroline Akunin looked up at her. Misunderstanding
 her tears. 'I'm sorry. I have to ask.'</p>

<p>'That's okay, Caroline. It was three weeks ago.'</p>

<p>Caroline nodded. 'I am going to take some swabs,
 is that okay?'</p>

<p>Kate nodded. Her body was already feeling like it
 was something apart from her once more. Distancing
 herself from her feelings, something she had learned
 at a young age. Something she had lived with for
 years until Delaney had made her feel connected with
 her body again. Now she felt violated and ashamed
 and wretched. But most of all, she felt angry.</p>

<p>A buzzing sound then a sharp ring. Kate looked
 across at her mobile phone that was vibrating on Jane
 Harrington's desk. 'You better pass that to me,
 Caroline. I told the office to call me only if it was
 really urgent.'</p>

<p>Delaney looked at the bloodshot eyes of Martin
 Quigley. Eyes that darted nervously back and forth.
 Eyes that squirmed under his scrutiny with pain and
 with fear. His right arm was suspended in a sling and
 covered with plaster. His fingers, that were visible,
 flexed nervously. His lower jaw was covered with
 wire and metal and held immobile. He grunted
 through the metal but quite clearly couldn't speak.
 He was a large man, somewhere in his forties. His
 nose had been broken many times in the past, and the
 home-made tattoos on his neck would quickly dispel
 any lingering suspicions that this man was employed
 in white-collar work.</p>

<p>Delaney didn't know the man, but he knew the
 type. Bruisers who communicated with their
 knuckles. Strong-arm men for cleverer criminals. A
 foot soldier, cannon fodder, a gorilla just like Kevin
 Norrell. He moved around the side of the bed, closer
 to him. 'You attacked Kevin Norrell, and I want to
 know why.' The man grunted again, an animal in
 pain. Delaney couldn't make out what he was saying.</p>

<p>Sally Cartwright took out a pad and a pen and held
 it out to Quigley's good hand. He flicked his broken-veined
 eyeballs to the left, where she stood, then back
 at Delaney and grunted again, but made no move to
 take the pen or notebook.</p>

<p>Delaney smiled at him. 'You taking what our
 American cousins would call the fifth, Quigley?'</p>

<p>Quigley glared at him with defiance in his eyes and
 didn't move.</p>

<p>Delaney glanced over at Sally. 'Give him the pen,
 Sally.'</p>

<p>Sally put the pen in his left hand but he made no
 move to hold it. Delaney reached over, put his own
 hand over Quigley's broken one and pulled it.
 Quigley grunted, loudly, his face red with pain and
 tears starting in his eyes. Delaney released his grip.
 'He'll take the pen now.'</p>

<p>This time Quigley held the pen. Sally put her
 notebook under it so that he could write.</p>

<p>'Why'd you attack him, Quigley?'</p>

<p>Quigley wrote one word. The scrawl was nearly
 undecipherable but Sally could just make it out. 'He's
 written "Nonce", sir.'</p>

<p>Delaney looked at Quigley. 'You saying you
 attacked Norrell because he was a paedophile?'</p>

<p>Quigley grunted an affirmative.</p>

<p>'Who put you up to it?'</p>

<p>Quigley grunted again and wrote some more. Sally
 read it out again. 'He says no one.'</p>

<p>'Just doing your civic duty, were you?'</p>

<p>Quigley grunted again, trying to keep his head as
 still as possible. Sally looked over at her boss. 'Do
 you believe him?'</p>

<p>'I don't know.' Delaney smiled at her then tugged
 on Quigley's hand again. Quigley's breath hissed
 through the metal mask of his teeth and he gurgled in
 pain. Delaney let go of his hand. 'You telling me the
 truth, Martin?'</p>

<p>Quigley's eyes pleaded with Delaney, his gurgling
 incoherent but comprehensible as Delaney reached
 towards his plastered arm once more.</p>

<p>Quigley pleaded with his eyes as Delaney's mobile
 phone rang. He grabbed it out of his jacket pocket
 and flipped it open.</p>

<p>'Delaney.'</p>

<p>'Jack, it's Diane.'</p>

<p>'I'm at the South Hampstead, interviewing
 someone.'</p>

<p>'It'll have to wait. I heard about Norrell and I'm
 sorry, but something's come up.'</p>

<p>'What?'</p>

<p>'We've got a dead body in the woods, South
 Hampstead Common. A young female.'</p>

<p>'We know who she is?'</p>

<p>'Not a damn thing. Uniform are securing the site,
 but given the weather we want it processed as soon
 as possible. Paddington Green should be handling it
 but they've got some big anti-terrorist initiative tying
 up their manpower.'</p>

<p>'Lucky us.'</p>

<p>Delaney looked across at the rain-speckled
 window and through it at the grey clouds overhead.
 'Give me the details.' Delaney listened for a moment
 or two then closed his phone. He put his mobile back
 in his pocket and gestured to Sally. 'We're out of
 here.'</p>

<p>The sigh of relief from Quigley was audible.
 Delaney turned back to him. 'I'll talk to you later.
 Meanwhile, you better pray Norrell makes it.
 Because if he doesn't I'm going to come back here
 and finish the job he started. And I'm a professional.'</p>

<p>Quigley glared at his back as they left his field of
 vision then closed his eyes nervously, snaked a
 tongue around his dry lips and swallowed with
 evident pain.</p>

<p>Kate Walker flicked the end of her long, multi-coloured
 scarf over one shoulder and walked
 quickly across the quadrangle and around the
 corner, passing the main entrance to the South
 Hampstead Hospital as she started for the car park.
 Her head was down and although the rain, for the
 moment at least, had stopped, the north-east wind
 still had a chill edge to it. She fumbled in her pocket
 for her keys when a voice called out to her.</p>

<p>'Kate.'</p>

<p>She looked round, her heart thudding in her chest,
 to see Paul Archer.</p>

<p>He smiled at her, his voice friendly. 'Kate, what are
 you doing here? Were you looking for me?'</p>

<p>Kate couldn't speak, she couldn't breathe, she
 leaned back against her car, fighting to control the
 panic.</p>

<p>Archer smiled at her. 'Is everything all right?'</p>

<p>She found her voice. 'Get away from me.'</p>

<p>Archer looked puzzled. 'What are you talking
 about?'</p>

<p>'I know what you did. So just stay away from me.'</p>

<p>'I've got no idea what you're talking about. I
 haven't done anything.'</p>

<p>'Last night . . .'</p>

<p>'Last night was your idea. You invited me back to
 your place, remember.'</p>

<p>Kate shook her head angrily. 'You're not going to
 get away with this.'</p>

<p>'Get away with what? I didn't do anything.'</p>

<p>'You're lying.'</p>

<p>'Nothing happened, Kate. We both got drunk, you
 suggested I stay over. We slept together, but nothing
 happened, if that's what you're worried about.'</p>

<p>Kate desperately wanted to believe him, but knew
 that something was wrong, something was definitely
 wrong. She knew her own body, didn't she? 'Then
 why can't I remember?'</p>

<p>Archer smiled at her, genuinely amused. 'You were
 absolutely paralytic, Kate. It's not unusual.'</p>

<p>Kate stepped closer to him, she wanted to knock
 the arrogant smirk off his cocky face. She wanted to
 hurt him, really hurt him. 'You're not going to get
 away with it, you sick pervert!' Archer grabbed both
 of her arms and she struggled furiously but his grip
 was like a vice. She looked up at him with livid eyes,
 her face contorted in fury. 'Let me go now, or I swear
 you will regret it!'</p>

<p>He pushed her away, the thin veneer of urbanity
 stripped from his face now as he sneered, 'What
 makes you think I'd want something like you?'</p>

<p>Kate slapped him hard across his face and went to
 slap him again but he caught her hand. 'Let go of my
 hand!' she yelled at him, red-faced with fury.</p>

<p>'You heard the lady.'</p>

<p>Archer released his grip on her and turned round to
 see a man looking at him impassively, scant inches
 away, a young woman standing behind him. The
 man was easily Archer's height, but had a few years
 on him and Archer was in far better physical shape.
 He poked the stranger in the chest. 'Back off,
 sunshine, and take your little friend with you. This is
 none of your business.'</p>

<p>Delaney punched him in the face. A hard straight
 punch to the bridge of his nose. So fast Archer didn't
 even see it coming. He gasped out in pain and
 dropped to his knees, completely taken aback.
 'You've broken my fucking nose.' Blood was spilling
 from his nose on to his hands.</p>

<p>Delaney turned back round to speak to Kate but
 she was already striding towards her car, her scarf of
 many colours flapping behind her long, curly hair
 like a sexy Doctor Who. Roy, from the burger van,
 would have approved, Delaney reckoned. He walked
 up to her as Kate got in her car, slammed the door
 shut and kicked over the engine.</p>

<p>'Kate!'</p>

<p>But she was gone, her wheels spinning, throwing
 up gravel like tiny shrapnel as she accelerated to the
 exit.</p>

<p>Archer was still whimpering, incredulous. 'You
 broke my fucking nose.'</p>

<p>Delaney ignored him, 'Come on, Sally.' He walked
 across the car park to their car.</p>

<p>DC Cartwright looked down at Archer who was
 staring at the blood on his hands in shock and utter
 disbelief. 'I'd get a plaster for that if I were you. They
 should have one in there.'</p>

<p>She jerked her thumb towards the hospital
 entrance and walked after Delaney.</p>

<p>Sally Cartwright adjusted the rear-view mirror
 watching the man Delaney had decked as he
 hobbled, clearly in pain, to the hospital entrance, a
 bloody handkerchief held to his nose. She turned the
 ignition key and looked across at Delaney, a slight
 frown creasing her neatly shaped eyebrows. 'Seat
 belt, sir.'</p>

<p>Delaney rolled his eyes and pulled his seat belt
 across, snapping it into place. 'Just drive, will you,
 Constable?'</p>

<p>'Sir.'</p>

<p>She slipped the clutch out and pulled the car
 smoothly out of the exit; no gravel flew behind them
 as she indicated left and headed towards the south
 part of Hampstead Heath.</p>

<p>After driving in silence for a couple of minutes she
 flicked a glance at her boss. 'What was all that about,
 do you reckon, sir?'</p>

<p>'I have absolutely no idea, Sally.'</p>

<p>'She seemed pretty upset.'</p>

<p>'Yup.'</p>

<p>'Do you think he'll make a complaint against you?'</p>

<p>'He doesn't know who I am.' Delaney shrugged
 and went back to staring out the window. Sally raised
 an eyebrow again and concentrated on the road
 ahead.</p>

<p>When he was sure the detective constable wasn't
 looking, Delaney rubbed his left hand over his right
 knuckles and winced. He had no idea what was going
 on with the man he had punched, or what he had to
 do with Kate. He had probably broken the man's
 nose who, after all, was right, it had been none of his
 business. It had felt good though, for all the wrong
 reasons. It had been a morning of frustrations,
 getting so close to discovering the identity of his
 wife's killers, only to be thwarted at the final hurdle.
 And he wasn't so unaware as to not realise he still
 had issues with Kate Walker. He had punched the
 man half out of anger, half out of a desire to impress
 her. He had told Kate that he didn't have room in his
 life for her, and it was true. He had too many
 unresolved matters to set straight. But if he had no
 room in his life for her, then why was there such a
 great hole in it?</p>

<p>Kate Walker's hands were still shaking as she slipped
 the gear into fourth and stepped on the accelerator
 pedal. Shaking, she realised, with shock and anger.
 Of all the people in the world she didn't want
 knowing about last night and what had happened to
 her, it was Jack Delaney. What on earth was the man
 doing there, for God's sake? It was bad enough that
 he had humiliated her yesterday, broke her heart and
 made her so depressed that she went to chase her
 blues away with vodka. If it hadn't been for him she
 would never have gone to the Holly Bush, would
 never have let a complete stranger chat her up at the
 bar. She wasn't a student, she wasn't a silly young
 girl who didn't know any better and didn't realise the
 dangers. In fact, she knew the dangers better than
 most, but had still let the man under her guard. Just
 like she had let Delaney under her guard, and look
 what had happened there. And, of course, he just had
 to be there when she confronted Paul Archer, making
 a fool of herself. She slammed the palm of her hand
 down hard on her horn, the hooter blaring out loudly
 and causing the cyclist she was overtaking to wobble
 dangerously to the side of the road.</p>

<p>She fought to calm her anger, steady the adrenalin
 coursing through her veins. But the truth was she was
 getting angrier by the minute. She had seen it in Paul
 Archer's eyes. He was amused. He was mocking her.
 There was a cold chill in those eyes. He had raped
 her. She absolutely believed it now. Believed it with a
 cold certainty in the heart of her soul. But she had
 absolutely no idea what she was going to do about it.</p>

<p>Paul Archer held a water-soaked handkerchief to his
 throbbing nose and wiped away the last vestiges of
 blood. The pain was like a thin spike driven into his
 forehead. He looked at his face in the mirror and
 turned left and right to look at each profile. As far as
 he could tell, and he was pretty qualified to tell, his
 nose wasn't broken. He put his hands under the cold
 water, watching as the deep red blood became
 thinner and paler as it swirled away. He scooped
 some of the cold water into the palm of his hand and
 held it against his forehead for a moment or two,
 waiting for the pain to ease.</p>

<p>Stepping away he snatched a paper towel and
 rubbed his hands dry as he walked across to the
 window, fumbling open a pack of Demerol and
 swallowing a couple. He looked out at the car park
 below and beyond. Puddles of rainwater, like
 irregular-shaped, murky mirrors, reflected the dark
 clouds, scudding in the skies above. There was
 nothing reflected in Paul Archer's eyes though. They
 stared ahead with a blank, cold certainty.</p>

<p>When he was nine years old, a couple of older boys
 at school, brothers, had bullied him. Making him
 drop his packed lunch of cheese and piccalilli
 sandwiches on to the rain-soaked tarmac of the
 playground. Kids didn't like other kids who were
 different and these two reckoned Paul Archer fancied
 himself as better than them because he didn't have to
 eat school lunches. As Paul watched his sandwiches
 soak up the muddy rain he didn't fight back, he
 didn't say a word, just picked up his Tupperware box
 and walked away, not even hearing the laughs and
 insults that were shouted after him. Paul was too
 intent listening to the cool voice of reason inside his
 head. The one that said no slight should go
 unpunished. And if he wasn't big enough or strong
 enough or old enough to make them suffer then he
 would hurt the thing they loved. He waited three
 weeks and then very early one Saturday morning he
 climbed over the fence of their back garden, rolled a
 lawn-mower against the door of the kennel where
 their pet dog, a Staffordshire bull terrier, slept,
 poured petrol he had taken from his dad's shed all
 over it and set it alight.</p>

<p>The adult Paul Archer held a hand to his throbbing
 nose again; there were many things he knew now that
 he hadn't as a child, but one thing that hadn't
 changed was that certain knowledge of the joy of
 retribution. He knew it as surely as night follows day.
 As death follows life. As pleasure follows pain.</p>

<p>Someone was going to pay.</p>

<p>In the front part of the head, in the roof of each
 nostril, lies a group of mucous-covered sacs. The
 olfactory epithelium. About five square centimetres
 in size and containing about ten million receptor
 cells. Using these receptors the human nose can
 differentiate, it has been claimed, between four
 thousand and ten thousand different odours. Odour
 is at the very genesis and denouement of human
 existence. A smell receptor has been identified in
 human sperm – the sperm literally smells its way to
 the egg. And death, as any policeman or mortician
 knows, is certainly no friend of the olfactory organ.
 However, the unmistakable smell of a deceased and
 decaying body had had no time to develop that
 morning and PC Bob Wilkinson reckoned his young
 colleague was as glad of that fact as anyone.</p>

<p>PC Danny Vine had already thrown up twice
 within the space of half an hour and Wilkinson,
 taking pity on him, had sent him to the front of the
 path to prevent anyone from disturbing the crime
 scene. Move along please. Nothing to see here. Only,
 of course, there was. There was plenty to see. But
 none of it pleasant.</p>

<p>The mechanics of investigation had already been
 set in motion. A large section of the surrounding area
 had been cordoned off with yellow tape stretching
 from tree to tree in a rough diamond shape, covering
 about a quarter of an acre. The yellow tape with
 '<emphasis>police do not cross</emphasis>' written upon it, the yellow tape
 that unfailingly attracted the prurient attention of the
 scandal-hungry public, just as the scent of another
 dog's waste always attracted canine interest. The sort
 of thrill-seeking interest the public had in other
 people's misfortune and pain, feeding off it like some
 kind of sick parasites. Road crash syndrome.</p>

<p>Police vans had been parked outside the cordoned
 area and uniformed police and white-suited scene-of-crime
 officers, SOCOs, went about containing the
 integrity of the site. Aluminium telescopic poles had
 been snapped open and joined together to form a
 skeletal framework which was positioned over the
 area immediately surrounding the body. Plastic sheets
 had been run over the frame so that the structure
 took on the appearance of a wedding marquee. Only
 within the frame, there was no cheery fiddle music,
 there was no three-tiered cake on a stand, no punchbowl,
 no laughing guests, no nervous best man and
 certainly no blushing bride with a blue garter on her
 stocking and a hungry husband by her side. Inside
 was the dead body of a woman in her mid-twenties,
 with black hair, black lipstick and black blood
 crusting the edges of the deep slash wounds to her
 chest, throat and abdomen.</p>

<p>Delaney and Sally Cartwright nodded at PC Danny
 Vine as they ducked under the tape and headed
 towards the murder scene. Danny responded with a
 half-hearted smile.</p>

<p>'You all right, Danny?' Sally asked.</p>

<p>The constable nodded again, unconvincingly.
 'Something I ate.'</p>

<p>'You still on for tonight?'</p>

<p>The constable smiled again, more warmly this
 time. 'Yeah, I'll be there. Bells on.'</p>

<p>Sally flashed him a quick smile and hurried to join
 Delaney.</p>

<p>'Something I should know about?' he asked.</p>

<p>'Sir?'</p>

<p>'Poster boy back there. You and he sharing
 handcuffs?'</p>

<p>Sally coloured lightly but laughed out loud. 'A few
 of us are meeting up for drinks, that's all.'</p>

<p>Delaney nodded, not entirely convinced. 'Right.'</p>

<p>'You're welcome to join us.'</p>

<p>Delaney nodded again. 'If you say so.'</p>

<p>'Anyway. It wouldn't be a crime, would it?'</p>

<p>'Not in my world.' Delaney's brief moment of
 good humour curled up and died as he walked
 forward and saw the dark-haired woman standing
 outside the scene-of-crime tent.</p>

<p>'Dr Walker. Nice scarf.'</p>

<p>Kate turned and looked at him, and cursed
 inwardly, as she took her scarf off and pulled the
 protective coverings over the work boots she had
 changed into. She should have known Delaney would
 turn up. He was, after all, less than a mile away, just
 like her, when the call had come in.</p>

<p>'Inspector.' She was surprised at how calm her
 voice sounded, how cool.</p>

<p>'Have you got anything for us?'</p>

<p>'Like you I've only just arrived. From what I've
 seen from here, a young woman, I'm guessing mid-twenties.'</p>

<p>'No ID?'</p>

<p>PC Wilkinson stepped forward. 'Nothing yet, sir.
 We're going to finger-search the area but there was
 nothing on her person. She had a handbag but it was
 empty apart from some condoms and a tube of KY
 jelly.'</p>

<p>'Nothing else?'</p>

<p>'She had a Tube ticket.'</p>

<p>Delaney nodded. South Hampstead Tube station
 was a stone's throw from the edge of that part of the
 heath.</p>

<p>'Who found her?'</p>

<p>Wilkinson nodded over to the path where the
 nurse, Valerie Manners, stood, sipping shakily from
 a cup of tea as a female PC talked to her.</p>

<p>'I'll want to speak to her next. Make sure she stays
 here, Bob.'</p>

<p>'Boss.'</p>

<p>Delaney moved to the entrance of the tent. 'Let's
 have a look.'</p>

<p>Kate Walker followed him in. The small space was
 already bustling. SOCO had cleared the overhanging
 undergrowth, carefully cutting away the branches
 and shrubbery that had partially hidden the body. A
 video-camera operator was filming the scene, while a
 photographer, blond-haired and in his twenties, was
 doing the same. The bright flashes poked needles in
 Delaney's sore eyes.</p>

<p>Kate looked down at the woman. She had black
 boots on her feet, calf-length and high-heeled, black
 leggings, a short black, leather skirt with an ornate,
 silver buckled belt. She was naked from the waist up.
 Her long hair was dyed deep black, and she was
 wearing black eyeshadow and lipstick. A goth. Kate
 felt the irony of it. A subculture that had death as
 part of its make-up, no pun intended. She would have
 laughed if it wasn't so pitifully sad. The woman was
 beautiful, in a painted-doll kind of way, with a full,
 voluptuous figure. Kate had to blink tears away as
 she looked at what had been done to her.</p>

<p>A bruise ran along the lower part of the dead
 woman's jaw on the right side of the face. The purple
 mottling even more obscene against the deathly white
 of her skin.</p>

<p>On the opposite side her neck had been slashed
 from ear to the larynx. Below her neck, a knife had
 opened up a circular hole, ripping down and
 exposing the bones of her spinal column. The large
 blood vessels on either side of the neck had been
 slashed, and blood had run down her semi-naked
 body in jagged sheets. The heart had been pumping
 when the wounds were made, spraying the blood
 outward with considerable pressure and telling her
 that the cuts had been made pre-mortem.</p>

<p>Kate turned to Delaney who was standing beside
 her and, thankfully, holding his counsel for once.
 'Whoever did it, I'd guess, used a large, relatively
 sharp blade, wielded with great force. He was full of
 rage, out of control I'd say. There are no defence
 wounds on her hands or arms so I would surmise the
 woman may have known her attacker.'</p>

<p>'Was she killed here?'</p>

<p>Kate nodded. 'Going by the arterial spray on the
 ground and undergrowth around her.'</p>

<p>She looked down at the young woman's body
 again. Was she right? Had she known the man who
 had done this to her? Or was it a random attack?
 Kate's gaze ran across the woman's mutilated body,
 past the slashes on her neck and down to her lower
 abdomen where a jagged cut ran across it. As if the
 man had held the knife down in a grip and had sawed
 through, like a huntsman gutting a deer. That could
 have been her, she realised, last night. Drugged,
 raped, she could have been mutilated too and
 dumped in the woods. Suddenly, the pinpricks in her
 eyes started in earnest and she could no longer hold
 back the tears. She felt her stomach lurch and knew
 she had to get out of there. She turned, pushed past
 Delaney, and ran through the opening of the tent.
 Ducking under the tape cordon she staggered into a
 wooded area away from the shocked looks of the
 police, fell to her knees and threw up. She bent her
 head low, holding her long dark hair away from her
 face, and threw up again. She put one hand on the
 wet ground to balance herself, weak with despair,
 and retched again painfully. She gulped in some
 ragged breaths of air, her throat cramping, and ran
 her hand over her forehead, now damp with
 perspiration. Her voice was a rough whisper as she
 swore through her panted breath.</p>

<p>It wasn't the Hippocratic oath.</p>

<p>Back in the scene-of-crime tent Delaney turned to
 Sally Cartwright. She had offered to go after the
 doctor but had been told her to stay where she was.
 'I guess a lot of people ate something dodgy this
 morning,' Delaney had said.</p>

<p>Sally looked down at the dead goth's mutilated
 body and felt queasy herself. 'I can't say I blame her.'</p>

<p>But Delaney was puzzled. Kate Walker was a
 consummate professional, had seen more dead bodies
 than even he had. Something was clearly up with her
 and he couldn't help wondering if it had something to
 do with the confrontation he had witnessed in the car
 park of the South Hampstead Hospital just a short
 while ago.</p>

<p>Kate Walker stood up. She took the bottle of Evian
 water she always kept in her handbag and took a
 swallow, rinsing the water around her mouth a few
 times and then spitting it out. She did it once more
 and then took a long swallow of the cold water. She
 poured a little more on a handkerchief and wiped her
 brow and lips and took a couple of deep breaths,
 willing her heart to slow down. She placed a hand
 against the damp bark of a tree and forced herself to
 breathe evenly.</p>

<p>Since an early age ambition had been Kate Walker's
 middle name. At school she had come top of her year
 seven years running. Unlike many of her peers she
 hadn't been distracted by boys or music or become
 fanatical about sports, she wasn't obsessive about
 ponies and didn't have a crush on her French teacher,
 she didn't spend hours shopping for outfits, had no
 fascination with shoes or handbags or jewellery or
 make-up, she didn't take an interest in anything, in
 fact, that wasn't going to further her academic career.
 As a young girl in prep school she hadn't been like
 that, she was a bit of a tomboy. She was as interested
 in climbing trees or playing cricket as any of her boy
 cousins. Her favourite novel was Arthur Ransome's
 <emphasis>Swallows and Amazons</emphasis> and a day cooped up inside
 on a fine summer's day was torture to her. All that
 had changed, however, one summer when she was
 eleven years old and her outer life became driven
 inward. It was a solemn-faced and earnest girl who
 went to St Angela's for Girls, keeping her dark
 thoughts behind her dark lashes. If the eyes were the
 window to the soul, Kate Walker's were tinted glass.
 St Angela's was for the wealthy and gifted children of
 the south London suburbs whose parents couldn't
 bear to send their daughters further south to Redean
 or west to St Helen's. Kate's studies became her life,
 and she quite literally lost herself in books. She might
 not have lost her love for Arthur Ransome but the
 adventures took place in her imagination now. As a
 fresher at university she ignored all entreaties to join
 societies that were about fun and not study. Most
 people went to university to play hard and work hard,
 a few went to party. Kate went to work hard and that
 was it. She got a first and went on to become an
 exemplary medical student. As a qualified doctor she
 wasn't content with the prospect of general practice.
 She took courses and the extra work as a police
 surgeon. It was while doing that, and working closely
 with the police, that she became fascinated with
 forensic anthropological science and the work of
 pathologists. One dealt with bones, the other with
 soft tissue. She had gone back to medical school,
 qualified and became a forensic pathologist. Overall it
 had taken over twelve years and it was all she ever
 wanted. And she was good at it, already targeted for
 the head of her department and beyond. Her future
 was as plotted out for her and as detailed as an
 Ordnance Survey map.</p>

<p>Today, though, as she looked across at the blue
 lights that were flashing through the trees and undergrowth
 ahead like a carnival for lost souls, she put a
 hand on her sore stomach, aching with the cramps of
 throwing up, and thought about the ravaged body of a
 woman just starting out in life, an unfinished symphony
 cut tragically short, about the horrible waste
 and the madness of it all, and she realised suddenly that
 she was sick of being a pathologist. She was sick of the
 blood and the pain and the daily reminder of the
 absolute evil that mankind was capable of. She was
 sick of dealing with the hard-headed cynicism of people
 like Jack Delaney and his ilk. Sick of death, in fact.</p>

<p>Sick to her stomach.</p>

<p>As she walked back to the crime scene she realised
 she had already come to a decision. She was going to
 phone Jane Harrington to see if the general practice
 position in her clinic attached to the hospital was still
 available. She had been offered the post a few weeks
 before and this time she would take her friend up on
 the offer. She'd have her resignation in to her boss by
 the end of the day. She had one last case to deal with
 first, though. She didn't know who the young girl in
 the woods was. She didn't know how she had died.
 But she would give her all finding out how and why
 she had died. She gave the unknown woman her oath
 on that much.</p>

<p>A blood oath.</p>

<p>*</p>

<p>Delaney tried to look sympathetic as the nurse,
 Valerie Manners, recounted the morning's events.
 'I'm sure it was all very traumatic for you.'</p>

<p>'Traumatic isn't the word. I'm used to traumatic.
 You work enough shifts on the accident and
 emergency unit at a large hospital and you get used
 to trauma.'</p>

<p>Bob Wilkinson spoke out. 'What would you call it
 then?'</p>

<p>Delaney threw a 'leave it out' look to the constable
 who was standing by Sally as she took notes.</p>

<p>Valerie Manners was a bit taken aback by the
 question and had to think a little, giving up after a
 few moments of struggle. 'Well, <emphasis>very</emphasis> traumatic I
 would say.'</p>

<p>Delaney nodded, again with sympathy. The trouble
 all too often with the public when they were caught up
 in a crime, was to make too much of everything. The
 answers to solving a crime were all too often in the
 everyday, mundane, prosaic details, not in the
 dramatic and the astounding. Many of the witnesses
 he had interviewed over the years had a tendency to
 vicariously sensationalise their own drab lives by way
 of someone else's tragedy. Memories became
 embellished with imagined detail. But Delaney was a
 seasoned enough copper to know how to winnow the
 wheat from the chaff. At least he hoped he was. 'Go
 back to the beginning, Mrs Manners.'</p>

<p>'It's Ms Manners.'</p>

<p>'Back to the beginning then please, Ms Manners.'</p>

<p>'I had stopped to catch my breath, leant on the tree
 over there—'</p>

<p>Delaney interrupted her. 'Before then?'</p>

<p>'When I saw the flasher?'</p>

<p>'Before that.'</p>

<p>'Back to leaving hospital?'</p>

<p>'Yes.'</p>

<p>The nurse looked at him perplexed, like he was an
 idiot. 'Is it relevant?'</p>

<p>Delaney sighed and looked at her, any sympathy he
 had for her draining fast. 'I'll tell you what, Ms
 Manners, let's make a deal. I won't tell you how to
 dress a wound or change a bedpan, and you let me
 decide what details are important or not in a
 particularly brutal murder case.'</p>

<p>'All right, no need to get snitty. I can get that kind
 of attitude any day of the week, if I want it, from the
 consultants who think they're better than good God
 Himself.'</p>

<p>Delaney ignored her. 'What time did you leave
 work this morning?'</p>

<p>'I left the hospital about eight o'clock.'</p>

<p>'And you always cut through this part of the
 heath?'</p>

<p>'Yes. It takes me about fifteen minutes to walk
 home. And a bit of fresh air never hurt anyone. I've
 learned that much in my job.'</p>

<p>Tell that to the woman in the scene of crime tent,
 thought Delaney, but didn't say it. 'And you didn't
 see anything out of the ordinary?'</p>

<p>'I saw a man wagging his penis at me! I'd count
 that as a pretty unusual event, wouldn't you?'</p>

<p>'Can you describe it?'</p>

<p>'The penis, or the event?'</p>

<p>Delaney sighed and Sally Cartwright and Bob
 Wilkinson had to try hard not to smile. 'Just tell us
 what happened?'</p>

<p>'I was walking on to the heath—'</p>

<p>Delaney interrupted her. 'You hadn't seen anybody
 earlier, somebody coming off the heath perhaps?'</p>

<p>The woman shook her head. 'Not a single soul.
 Weather like this tends to keep people at home or in
 their cars, doesn't it?'</p>

<p>Sally looked up from her notebook. 'And the man
 who exposed himself to you . . . ?'</p>

<p>'He was in his late twenties I'd say, maybe thirties.
 Semi-priapic.'</p>

<p>'I'm sorry?' Sally asked.</p>

<p>Wilkinson smiled. 'He had a hard-on, Sally.'</p>

<p>'Yeah, thanks, Bob,' said Delaney.</p>

<p>'Well, partly so, enough I guess for him to waggle,'
 added the nurse. 'It was early, and it was pretty cold,
 mind you.'</p>

<p>Delaney held up his hand. 'Can we concentrate on
 the man, not just the member?'</p>

<p>'He was about five ten, wearing a fawn-coloured
 overcoat, he might have had a suit on under his coat,
 he had dark trousers anyway.'</p>

<p>Sally flicked back through her notebook. 'You
 called him a raggedy man earlier.'</p>

<p>Valerie Manners nodded. 'Yes, it was his hair.'</p>

<p>Delaney waited patiently, but when there was nothing
 forthcoming, said, 'And? What about his hair?'</p>

<p>'It was raggedy, you know?'</p>

<p>'No?'</p>

<p>'Sort of wild, curly. A bit like yours.' She pointed
 to Delaney. 'Only longer and it hadn't been combed,
 it was sticking out.'</p>

<p>'Like his cock,' said Bob Wilkinson, his smile
 suddenly dying on his lips as Delaney glared at him,
 the detective inspector's already thin patience finally
 worn through.</p>

<p>At the mortuary Kate Walker scrubbed her hands,
 holding them under the hot water and rubbing the
 brush as if to scratch away the touch of Paul Archer.
 She felt like dipping them in acid.</p>

<p>'Are you all right, Dr Walker?' Lorraine Simons
 had come into the room and was watching her,
 concern evident in her eyes.</p>

<p>'I'm fine.' Kate finished her hands, drying them
 and slipping on a pair of latex gloves.</p>

<p>'You had a phone call earlier. Dr Jane Harrington.
 She didn't leave a message.'</p>

<p>Kate nodded. 'It can wait. She can't.' She walked
 across to the mortuary table where the body of the
 murdered girl was laid out in cold, clinical repose.
 Her naked skin pearlescent white under the bright
 lights, like a dead snow queen.</p>

<p>Kate watched as her assistant joined her at the
 table, wheeling across the stack of instruments with
 which they would try and ascertain the manner of the
 young woman's death. Quantify it. Render a human
 life into its constituent parts. Why was she doing
 this? she thought to herself. Working with the dead?
 Maybe her friend Jane was right, she had always been
 so sure of herself. But suddenly everything was
 shifting for her, nothing was fixed. Her career had
 always been a focus, a constant. Now? Now she
 didn't even know who she was any more.</p>

<p>She glanced across at her young assistant. 'What
 made you want to do this job?' she asked.</p>

<p>Lorraine looked at her a little puzzled. 'Don't you
 remember asking me that in my interview?'</p>

<p>Kate smiled apologetically. 'There were a lot of
 interviews. A lot of interviewees, all of them saying
 the same thing. I just wondered what it really was for
 you?'</p>

<p>Lorraine picked up a scalpel and ran her thumb
 along the blunt part of it. 'All through medical school
 I wanted to be a surgeon.'</p>

<p>'What changed?'</p>

<p>'It was a gradual thing, really. But one night, I was
 an intern on surgical rotation and a couple of
 children were brought in. A ten-year-old boy and a
 six-year-old girl. They had both been repeatedly
 stabbed. By their father.'</p>

<p>'Go on.'</p>

<p>'He was a manic-depressive. On a cocktail of
 antidepressants, booze and marijuana. He had an
 argument with his wife, picked up a carving knife and
 stabbed both his kids to punish her.'</p>

<p>'Nice.'</p>

<p>'The boy lasted an hour. We did what we could but
 he had lost a lot of blood. We worked on the girl
 through the night. There were multiple complications,
 she had been stabbed nine times. We brought
 her out of surgery and had to take her back in as she
 arrested in recovery. She arrested again on the table.'
 She put the scalpel down and looked steadily at Kate.
 'When she arrested again we had to let her go. Even
 had she survived she would have been brain-dead.
 There was nothing we could do. We had to tell the
 mother she had lost both her children. Some hours
 later the mother jumped in front of a train on the
 Northern Line at Chalk Farm.'</p>

<p>Kate shook her head sympathetically. 'It wasn't
 your fault. You did what you could.'</p>

<p>Lorraine nodded. 'I don't blame myself. There's
 only one person responsible for their deaths. But I
 couldn't deal with it any more. I couldn't deal with
 the fact that whatever you do, however much you try,
 eventually someone will die. And if you are going to
 be a surgeon you have to be able to deal with that.
 You have to be able to detach emotionally. And I
 couldn't. And I didn't want to go into general
 practice.' She looked down on the cold body of the
 dead woman. 'At least in here you can't fail. Nobody
 pays a price for your mistakes.'</p>

<p>'That's true . . .' Kate looked at the dead woman's
 face, at her neck, at the start of the first incision, but
 knew that she was lying to her young assistant.
 '. . . and at least you didn't say you had a crush on
 Amanda Burton.'</p>

<p>'Who?'</p>

<p>'Good answer.'</p>

<p>Kate looked back at the dead woman's neck again
 and then bent down to get a closer look. 'What do
 you make of this?'</p>

<p>Lorraine moved around the table to see what Kate
 was looking at. 'It appears to be some kind of
 puncture wound.'</p>

<p>'Get the camera. Let's take some close-up shots.</p>

<p>Jack Delaney took a big bite out of his second bacon
 sandwich that day and grunted with approval.
 'You're an irritating bastard at the best of times, Roy,
 but you make a halfway decent sandwich.'</p>

<p>'From anyone else I'd tell them to stick their head
 in a pig, but coming from you, Inspector Delaney, I'll
 take that as a big fucking compliment.' Roy smiled
 broadly, his teeth like an old piano with half the keys
 missing, and turned back to the book he was reading.
 A new science-fiction blockbuster by Peter F.
 Hamilton from whom he had nicked the name for his
 burger van.</p>

<p>Delaney walked across to Sally Cartwright who
 was delicately eating a bean burger as she leaned
 against the bonnet of her car. Her small teeth made
 precise, uniform bites. Delaney leaned beside her on
 the bonnet finishing his sandwich and considered
 matters. Now that the body of the young goth
 woman had been removed to the morgue, the SOCOs
 and uniforms were conducting a fingertip search and
 dusting any suitable surface. Given the overnight rain
 Delaney doubted there would be any chance of lifting
 any prints. Kate Walker had barely said three words
 to him since returning to the scene-of-crime tent. He
 hadn't expected her to be sweetness and light to him
 but he had hoped she could keep a professional
 neutrality, at least. He knew he had hurt her, but they
 had only slept together once after all, and that hardly
 constituted a relationship. And the fact of the matter
 was he had only ended their affair because he didn't
 want to see her getting hurt. He knew his own
 failings better than anybody and he knew he wasn't
 in a place right now to be of any use in her life. He
 couldn't remember who said it but he remembered
 the quote about the eleventh commandment. 'Never
 sleep with anybody who has got more problems than
 you have.' He reckoned that between Kate Walker
 and himself that would be a close run thing. One
 thing was sure, though, she was certainly taking the
 case this morning a whole lot more personally than
 he had ever seen her take one before. Kate Walker
 had always been practically a byword for icy
 efficiency, but the dead goth had certainly got to her
 in some way, that much was painfully obvious.</p>

<p>'Sir?'</p>

<p>Delaney blinked out of his thoughts and looked at
 Sally. 'Sorry, what?'</p>

<p>'I was asking about the raggedy-haired man. You
 think he's connected with the dead girl?'</p>

<p>Delaney finished his sandwich. 'I don't know. I
 think we should find him, though.'</p>

<p>'Do you think there is a sexual connection with the
 murder?'</p>

<p>Delaney wiped his hands and stood up. 'We'll find
 out soon enough if there is. But she was naked from
 the waist up which suggests a sexual element. And
 the psychiatrists tell us often enough that in these sort
 of crimes the knife becomes a phallic substitute.'</p>

<p>'Boys and their toys, eh, Inspector?'</p>

<p>'Something like that. Come on, Constable. Or are
 you going to take all day eating that burger?'</p>

<p>Delaney walked off, crossing over the road and
 headed towards White City police station, purpose in
 his stride.</p>

<p>Diane Campbell looked up from her desk as Delaney
 came into her office. She gestured to him as she took
 out a packet of cigarettes and walked to the window.
 'Keep an eye out. The new super has a bug up his arse
 about smoking. Anyone would think it's against the
 law.'</p>

<p>'It is, Diane.'</p>

<p>She smiled and fired up a cigarette and opened her
 window slightly. 'So, what have you got for me,
 cowboy?'</p>

<p>Delaney shrugged. 'Nothing new. The body is at
 the morgue.'</p>

<p>'What's your instinct? Sexual predator? First date
 gone wrong? Homicidal maniac?'</p>

<p>'I don't know, boss. A lot of anger there, that much
 is clear.'</p>

<p>'Killed in the woods, or dumped there?'</p>

<p>'The doc reckons she was killed where we found
 her. The blood-spatter patterns seem pretty
 conclusive.'</p>

<p>'Did she give a time of death?'</p>

<p>'Last night.' He shrugged. 'Hopefully we'll know
 more after the post.'</p>

<p>Diane took a drag on her cigarette and looked at
 him. 'And what did you get up to after I dropped you
 off?'</p>

<p>'I went home and tucked myself straight up in bed
 like a good boy.'</p>

<p>'Yeah, right.'</p>

<p>He smiled, but his eyes were flat. Remembering.</p>

<p>Delaney hunched the collar of his jacket around his
 neck and leaned back, shielding himself from the
 wind as he lit the cigarette that was his excuse for
 getting off the train. The dark-haired woman in the
 carriage had reminded him of Kate. It wasn't her.
 Wasn't remotely like her, apart from the hair. But he
 couldn't keep her out of his mind and, suddenly
 claustrophobic with his thoughts, he had hurried
 through the closing doors, shouldered through the
 crowds, up the escalator and out into the fresh, cool
 air.</p>

<p>Eight o'clock at night and it was already dark. The
 black clouds overhead were pregnant with rain, a real
 burst of it looked imminent, but the pavement was
 bright from the street lamps and the wash of light
 that spilled from the broad windows of WH Smith
 which Delaney was leaning against. He stood there
 for a moment or two, watching people hurry across
 the road and into the safety of the station. He
 watched a woman in her forties with dyed, ill-kempt,
 blonde hair and a red vinyl jacket walk near the
 phone boxes, scanning the eyes of approaching men,
 looking to make a deal, needing another fix and not
 caring about the weather.</p>

<p>Delaney finished his cigarette and walked back to
 the station entrance. A couple of stops up the
 Northern Line and he'd be in Belsize Park. Back
 home. Only it didn't feel like home to him and he was
 not sure it ever would. He paused at the entrance.
 Maybe he should do as his boss suggested. He'd had
 quite a few drinks already but he was a very long way
 from being rat-arsed. He shook another cigarette out
 of a packet and lit it, feeling his heart pound in his
 chest, and came to a decision. He blew out a stream
 of smoke and started walking. Away from the station
 towards the British Library. He crossed over the
 road, running to dodge the traffic, and walked a
 couple of hundred yards up Pentonville Road
 towards Judd Street and went into a pub on the
 corner of the two roads. An Irish bar, a proper one,
 not a diddly shamrock theme pub. The warmth and
 the noise wrapped around him as he entered, the light
 was bright but, for a change, Delaney didn't mind
 that. He walked across the scuffed wooden floor to
 the long, scruffy bar and ordered a large whiskey and
 a pint of Guinness from the freckled woman in her
 thirties who was stood behind it. He had downed the
 whiskey before the Guinness had settled and ordered
 another one. He was sipping it a little bit more slowly
 when a soft, hot, moist voice whispered in his ear.</p>

<p>'Hello, stranger.'</p>

<p>He turned round and took another sip of the
 whiskey, looking into the cool, green eyes of the
 woman who had sat on the stool next to him. Her hip
 rubbing against his thigh. She was dressed in skintight
 jeans, a cream-coloured wool jumper and a
 brown suede jacket. Delaney smiled at her and raised
 his glass. 'Stella Trant.'</p>

<p>'In the flesh.' Stella leaned against the bar putting
 her shoulders back in a feline manner, stretching the
 jumper across her braless chest.</p>

<p>Delaney smiled again and looked again into her
 deep, green eyes, seeing the playfulness sparking in
 them now. 'Buy you a drink?'</p>

<p>Stella smiled, nodding, and rubbed her arm,
 wincing a little.</p>

<p>'You hurt yourself?'</p>

<p>'Tennis elbow. Professional injury.'</p>

<p>'You play tennis?'</p>

<p>'Swinging a whip. Toy one, made of suede. Some
 guy had me manacle him to a wall in his cellar and
 pretend to whip him heavily for an hour.' She rubbed
 her arm again. 'The novelty soon wears off.' She
 looked at him pointedly and smiled. 'Reminds me a
 lot of you by the way. Same hair, same dress sense.'</p>

<p>Delaney shook his head, a smile on the edge of his
 lips. 'Not me. I don't play at things.'</p>

<p>'Is that a fact?'</p>

<p>Delaney looked at her steadily as he finished his
 second whiskey. 'Not unless I win.'</p>

<p>'Maybe next time I'll let you.'</p>

<p>Superintendent George Napier did little to hide his
 dislike of the man standing in front of his desk. The
 man's eyes were bloodshot, his hair was too long, too
 curly, too far from neatly combed. Altogether there
 was a sense of looseness to his appearance. Jack
 Delaney. Slack Delaney more like! Too cocky, too
 casual, too damned indifferent. George Napier was
 not a man who did casual and had little time for
 those that did. He didn't much care for the Irish
 either. He didn't trust them. He still remembered
 hundreds of Irish men and women lining the streets
 of Kilburn to mark the funeral of one of their IRA
 heroes. Once a criminal always a criminal in his
 book, and he recognised the status of the IRA as a
 legitimate political operation about as much as he
 recognised the legitimacy of the claim Argentina had
 on the Falklands. Mainly he didn't like the man's
 sullen, mute insolence. No respect for authority. That
 was obvious. Like many of his generation he would
 have benefited from National Service.</p>

<p>George Napier was too young himself to have gone
 through National Service, but he had joined the
 Territorial Army while at university and when he
 graduated it had been a toss-up between the armed
 forces and the police. The police had won by a
 narrow margin. The man in front of him wouldn't
 last a weekend with the TA he decided, let alone the
 proper army.</p>

<p>As far as he was concerned the police force should
 be like a domestic army. Anybody who didn't realise
 they were fighting a war nowadays hadn't read the
 papers or listened to the news. Never mind the war
 on terror; the amount of guns and knives on the
 streets made the boroughs of London every bit as
 dangerous a place to live as Beirut in his opinion.
 And to fight that, to bring law and order back to the
 country, took vision, it took backbone and it took
 discipline, by God. And although he knew that the
 man standing in front of him had been responsible
 for bringing down a couple of bad apples within the
 department, he was far from convinced that Delaney
 wasn't a bruised fruit himself. He put the report he
 had been reading into a folder and shook his head.</p>

<p>'I'm sorry, but that won't be possible. It wouldn't
 be appropriate, I'm afraid, Inspector.'</p>

<p>'I was responsible for the man's arrest, and he has
 vital information on another case, sir.'</p>

<p>The superintendent picked up the folder again and
 waved it at Delaney. 'As I recall it, after his arrest he
 had to spend time in accident and emergency with a
 suspected fractured skull. And the other case is the
 incident in which your wife died?'</p>

<p>'That's right.'</p>

<p>'Given your involvement in that incident, and the
 fact that it was your wife who was killed, I don't
 think it is appropriate for you to take the lead on this
 investigation. Which is why I have instructed
 Detective Inspector Skinner to coordinate with the
 prison authorities and their internal investigation.'</p>

<p>'With respect, sir, Norrell said he would only speak
 to me.'</p>

<p>The superintendent frowned. 'I don't think he is in
 any condition to speak to anyone just now.'</p>

<p>'Convenient timing.'</p>

<p>Superintendent Napier sighed. 'Concentrate on this
 dead woman on the common, Delaney. Any
 movement on identifying her?'</p>

<p>'Nothing yet, but we're working on it. She doesn't
 match anyone on the missing persons' register.'</p>

<p>'I want a tight lid, Delaney. I've already had the
 press wanting details.'</p>

<p>'Maybe it would help, sir. Someone probably
 knows her.'</p>

<p>'We speak to the press when I say. We clear on
 that, Inspector?'</p>

<p>'Sir.'</p>

<p>Delaney turned to leave, pausing at the door as the
 superintendent called him back.</p>

<p>'One more thing, Delaney.'</p>

<p>'Sir?'</p>

<p>'I am well aware what happened between you and
 my predecessor. Diane Campbell argued very
 strongly for bringing you back into the fold. I think
 you should know that I had grave misgivings but
 allowed myself to be persuaded by her. I hope you
 are not going to let me down.'</p>

<p>'Just let me do my job, sir. That's all I ask.'</p>

<p>The superintendent stood and picked up the file,
 nodding a dismissal to Delaney. 'Go and do it then.'</p>

<p>Delaney shut the door behind him. Napier walked
 across to a filing cabinet and put the folder in the top
 drawer. He looked at himself in the mirror and
 smoothed his hair with the flat of his hand. He kept
 himself in very good condition. A punishing fitness
 schedule, good bone structure and clear, ebony skin
 made him look younger than his fifty-two years, but
 the white hair above his ears told the true story. As
 he looked at his temples critically, he considered, yet
 again, dyeing his hair, but then discounted it, as he
 always did. Gravitas was far more becoming in a
 career policeman than vanity. And George Napier
 was nothing if not ambitious.</p>

<p>He sat back behind his desk and thought about the
 surly policeman who had just left his office. He
 wasn't sure there was a place for people like him in
 the force any more, but time would tell: Jack Delaney
 could be a help or a hindrance to him. And most of
 the people who had spoken to the superintendent
 said Delaney was a first-rate detective with good
 instincts and a great success rate. If his foot danced a
 little outside the touchline now and again that was
 fine by him, as long as he didn't drop the ball. But if
 he did lose it in the tackle, if he became more of a
 liability than an asset, then George Napier was going
 to come down on him like an All Blacks front line.
 Guaranteed.</p>

<p>Delaney paused at the drinks cooler filling a cup as
 DI Jimmy Skinner approached. Delaney was still considered
 tall, at six feet, but Jimmy Skinner had a good
 few inches on him. He was a lot thinner, though, and
 pale-faced from too many nights playing Internet
 poker. His wife had left him the previous January
 because he had refused to walk away from an online
 game at midnight to hear Big Ben chime the New
 Year in and kiss her on the final bong. He had felt
 quite justified, however, as he was holding two aces
 with a third on the flop. But his wife didn't see it that
 way, and now he had even more time on his hands.
 'You've simply got to know when to hold them,
 know when to fold them,' he had told his divorce
 lawyer, who had told him that it was his balls his
 wife was holding, fiscally speaking, and that she was
 going to cut them off. Which she proceeded to do,
 leaving Skinner a fiscal soprano.</p>

<p>Skinner helped himself to a cup of water and
 looked at Delaney. 'You spoke to the new big cheese
 then?'</p>

<p>Delaney drank his water in a long gulp almost
 feeling the liquid rehydrating his veins. 'Yup.'</p>

<p>'What do you make of him?'</p>

<p>'Remember the old joke about how to become a
 policeman?'</p>

<p>'Grow a tit on your head and paint it blue?'</p>

<p>Delaney threw his cup in the bin. 'You're looking
 into the Norrell thing, I hear.'</p>

<p>'You tag along any time you want to, Jack.'</p>

<p>Delaney nodded. 'Appreciate it, Jimmy.'</p>

<p>'You were due to see him this morning?'</p>

<p>'First thing, yeah.'</p>

<p>'Seems like a hell of a coincidence he was taken out
 before you got there then.'</p>

<p>Delaney grunted. 'I don't believe in coincidences.'</p>

<p>'You think he genuinely knew something about
 your wife's death?'</p>

<p>'Nothing in it for him if he was making it up.'</p>

<p>'Kevin Norrell was never a grass.'</p>

<p>'Yeah, well, your perspectives change when you're
 standing naked in a shower surrounded by hardened
 criminals. No pun intended.'</p>

<p>'True.'</p>

<p>'Or when there's a contract out on you.'</p>

<p>Skinner looked at him, a little surprised. 'You
 think that was the case?'</p>

<p>'I think as soon as he started offering to sing like a
 canary, someone wanted to snap off his beak and clip
 his wings. Permanently.'</p>

<p>'He was meant to go down hard. That's for certain.
 But if they thought he was dealing kiddie porn . . . ?'
 He shrugged. 'Could just be that, cowboy.'</p>

<p>'It's too neat. Someone in there wanted him shut
 up and quickly.'</p>

<p>Delaney and Skinner walked back towards the
 CID offices. 'You saw one of the guys who attacked
 him?'</p>

<p>'Martin Quigley. But he isn't saying anything.
 Norrell smashed him up pretty good with a lavatory
 bowl. Fractured his jaw in three places.'</p>

<p>'Helpful.'</p>

<p>'But he can write. He claims they took Norrell out
 as a matter of course, like they would any other
 kiddie fiddler, given half the chance. No other
 agenda.'</p>

<p>'You believe him?'</p>

<p>'I don't know. He might have been roped in. He's
 just as much an ape for hire as Norrell himself. Paid
 to hurt not to think. And Norrell was involved with
 Walker who was involved big time in kiddie porn. It's
 a good cover story if you have another reason for
 wanting him dead.'</p>

<p>Delaney said goodbye to Skinner, stuck his head
 round the CID office door and beckoned to Sally
 Cartwright. 'Come on, Constable, you're with me.'</p>

<p>Sally stood up from her desk, a little flushed,
 quickly closing down the report she had been reading
 on her computer. She picked up her jacket from the
 back of her chair and joined Delaney.</p>

<p>He looked back at her computer as her screensaver
 came on. 'What are you working on?'</p>

<p>'Just catching up with some paperwork.' She
 avoided his eyes and headed briskly out to the
 corridor. 'Where are we going?'</p>

<p>'South Hampstead Tube.'</p>

<p>'Sir?'</p>

<p>Delaney walked beside her and held out a photofit
 picture that the computer artist had generated from
 Valerie Manners' description of the flasher on the
 common. 'Our man might have been wearing a suit,
 she said?'</p>

<p>'Apparently. Under his mac,' Sally confirmed.</p>

<p>'So what does that tell us?'</p>

<p>'That flashing isn't just a blue-collar crime and he's
 probably not a student.'</p>

<p>'Exactly, he's up too early in the morning for a
 start. Maybe he was giving his John Thomas a quick
 airing before putting in a hard day at the office . . .'
 He looked at Sally and smiled. 'As it were.'</p>

<p>'Which do you reckon came first, sir? The book or
 the expression? I've often wondered.'</p>

<p>'What are you on about?' Delaney asked,
 puzzled.</p>

<p>'John Thomas and Lady Jane. <emphasis>Lady Chatterley's
 Lover</emphasis>.'</p>

<p>Delaney threw her a look. 'I know you've got a
 degree and all that shite, Detective Constable, but do
 you think you could save the book-club chit-chat for
 your weekend dinner parties and concentrate on the
 case?'</p>

<p>'You reckon he was heading for the Tube?'</p>

<p>'He lives or works near here. And given the timing
 it is more likely he was on his way to work
 somewhere out of the locality.'</p>

<p>'So you think he lives somewhere near the heath?'</p>

<p>'Sexual predators like to operate within a comfort
 zone. Somewhere they know well. So if something
 happens they know where to run to.'</p>

<p>'And the murdered girl. Does she live locally, do
 you think?'</p>

<p>The desk sergeant called out as they headed to the
 front entrance. 'Good to see you back, Jack.'</p>

<p>'Cheers, Dave.' He opened the front door for Sally.
 'I don't know about the girl. It depends if it was an
 opportunistic or planned killing. Time of death will
 help.'</p>

<p>'Not going to be wandering on the heath in the
 dead of night you mean.'</p>

<p>Delaney nodded as they walked over to Sally's car.
 'It's unlikely.'</p>

<p>'Mind you, it was a full moon last night.'</p>

<p>'Meaning?'</p>

<p>Sally fished out her car keys and opened the
 driver's door to her car. 'Well, it brings out the
 crazies. And her being a goth. Maybe there's a connection.
 The mystic power of the moon and all that.'</p>

<p>Delaney got into the car next to her and stretched
 his legs forward. 'The moon might play a part in
 paganism. Witchcraft, Wicca, that kind of thing. Not
 sure it applies to goths.'</p>

<p>'No. But the belt buckle. I've been thinking about
 it.'</p>

<p>'What about it?'</p>

<p>'Looking at the photos more closely both sides had
 a representation of the Green Man. Big pagan
 symbol.'</p>

<p>Delaney nodded thoughtfully. 'Maybe, and there
 may have been a full moon last night, but you'd never
 have been able to see it. Not with all that cloud cover
 and rain.'</p>

<p>'I suppose not. So, it looks like the body was
 dumped there. She could have come from anywhere.'</p>

<p>'"Ill met by moonlight, proud Titania."'</p>

<p>Sally looked across at him, frowning as she fired up
 the engine. 'Sir?'</p>

<p>'What? You surprised I know a little Shakespeare?
 They do have schools in Ireland, you know.'</p>

<p>'Yeah, I do know that. Put your seat belt on.'</p>

<p>Delaney sighed and pulled the strap across. 'And
 it's cockney rhyming slang.'</p>

<p>'What is?'</p>

<p>'John Thomas. So the expression came first.'</p>

<p>'Oh.' Sally smiled. 'So what does it rhyme with?'</p>

<p>Delaney considered for a moment, then sighed and
 flapped his hand. 'Just drive the car, Constable.'</p>

<p>'On average two and a half million people use the
 tube system every day and I'm guessing something
 like bloody plenty of them use South Hampstead
 station,' Delaney said as he stood up from the
 computer, rubbed his sore eyes and yawned.</p>

<p>Sally paused the CCTV footage and looked up at
 him, amusement quirking the corners of her mouth.
 'Must have been some night.'</p>

<p>Delaney yawned again, putting his hand in front of
 his mouth. 'You have no idea.'</p>

<p>Sally gestured at the computer screen. 'We're up to
 twelve o'clock.'</p>

<p>Delaney nodded and stretched his eyes. 'Let's get
 these photos in front of the nurse, see if she
 recognises any of them.'</p>

<p>Sally collected three photos that had been printed
 out of some possible men that matched the
 description of the flasher they had been given by
 Valerie Manners and stood up.</p>

<p>Kate Walker was sitting at her computer typing up
 her notes for the post-mortem on the mystery
 woman. She pushed the print icon and some
 moments later picked up a ten by eight, black-and-white
 close-up of the woman's neck. Someone had
 slashed her hard enough to slice the flesh clear to the
 bone. What kind of anger could have fuelled such
 brutality? Even if the attack was sexually motivated
 it still came down to anger. Impotent rage, maybe, as
 it was clear the woman had not been sexually
 assaulted. No evidence of it at least. The irony of the
 thought was not lost on her and she shivered again,
 thinking about the possibility that it could have been
 her dead body being examined by one of her
 colleagues. How close a tightrope to death we walk
 in life, she thought. How fragile the human body is.
 How soft and defenceless against true purpose, true
 will to hurt. And yet we dance on the tightrope
 blindfolded, and laugh while we do it. Only Kate
 didn't feel like laughing today. She wasn't sure she
 ever would again. The telephone rang suddenly,
 shrilly. She started, her heart thumping in her chest,
 and snatched the phone up, taking a moment or two
 to steady her shattered nerves before answering.
 'Kate Walker.'</p>

<p>'Kate, it's Caroline Akunin.'</p>

<p>Kate took in a deep breath. 'Go on.'</p>

<p>'I haven't got the blood work back . . .' She
 paused.</p>

<p>'But?' asked Kate.</p>

<p>'But, I ran a check on Paul Archer.'</p>

<p>'And?'</p>

<p>'He's out on police bail at the moment, Kate.
 Pending trial. He's already been charged with rape.'</p>

<p>Kate was puzzled for a moment. 'What do you
 mean?'</p>

<p>'His estranged wife. She's charged him with rape.
 The court case is coming up this week. He's a rapist,
 Kate.'</p>

<p>Kate nodded, taking it in, she couldn't speak for
 a moment. 'I'm coming in to White City now for a
 briefing, I'll come and see you while I'm there.'</p>

<p>She hung up the phone and collected the
 photographs and her printed out notes. She stood up
 and winced, holding a hand to her stomach and had
 to fight the urge to throw up again.</p>

<p>Valerie Manners looked impatiently at her watch and
 scowled at Danny Vine, the uniformed constable who
 was stood by the door of the interview room at the
 front part of White City police station. It was a
 featureless, plain room, with a rectangular table, six
 plastic chairs and a couple of windows looking out to
 the car park. Not a particularly pleasant place to
 spend any length of time. She looked at her watch
 again. 'How much longer are they going to be?' she
 snapped.</p>

<p>The newly qualified constable shrugged. 'They're
 on their way. Hard to tell.'</p>

<p>'Well, it's not good enough. I'm due back on shift
 in a few hours and I've hardly had time to catch forty
 winks, let alone have a proper sleep.'</p>

<p>'You could always call in. You have had a
 traumatic day.'</p>

<p>The nurse shook her head angrily. 'You see, that's
 what's wrong with this generation. The slightest
 thing and people can just call in. Where would we be
 if the RAF had just <emphasis>called in</emphasis> in 1940?'</p>

<p>'I don't know, ma'am.'</p>

<p>'Well, I tell you where we'd be. We'd be right here,'
 she said, realising that wasn't quite what she meant.
 'Only we wouldn't be speaking English, would we?
 We'd be speaking German.'</p>

<p>'I've got an A level in German.'</p>

<p>Valerie glared at him. 'Is that supposed to be
 funny?'</p>

<p>'No. I was just saying.'</p>

<p>'And that's another wrong. People are always "just
 saying". In my day, young man, people <emphasis>did</emphasis>. They
 didn't say. They got on with it. They got the job
 done.'</p>

<p>Danny Vine sighed inwardly with relief as the
 handle on the door turned and DI Jack Delaney and
 DC Sally Cartwright came into the room.</p>

<p>'Sorry to keep you waiting, Ms Manners.'</p>

<p>Valerie smiled sweetly at Delaney. 'That's quite all
 right, Detective Inspector. As I was just explaining to
 the young officer . . .' she gestured unimpressed at
 Danny Vine, 'I am only too happy to do my civic
 duty. Only too happy.'</p>

<p>'We're very grateful.'</p>

<p>The nurse held her hand up. 'No gratitude
 necessary. I am from a generation that steps up to the
 line when the call comes.'</p>

<p>Delaney pulled out a chair and sat opposite her. He
 opened a folder and put the photographs of the men
 they had pulled from the security footage from South
 Hampstead Tube station.</p>

<p>'I'd like you to look at these photos, Ms Manners.
 See if you recognise any of the men as the gentleman
 you encountered this morning.'</p>

<p>'The pervert, you mean. He was certainly no
 gentleman.'</p>

<p>She pulled out a pair of glasses from her handbag
 and perched them on the end of her nose as she
 looked at the photographs Delaney had handed her
 across the table. She studied each one for a long time
 before looking up and taking her glasses off. 'They all
 look possible.'</p>

<p>'But you can't be sure.'</p>

<p>The nurse shrugged apologetically. 'Well, if I'm
 honest my eyes weren't exactly drawn to his face, if
 you see what I mean.'</p>

<p>Sally Cartwright stepped forward. 'Could you look
 again, Ms Manners?'</p>

<p>Valerie Manners picked up the photos and looked
 at them again, then shook her head and handed the
 photos back to Sally. 'Sorry, but any one of them
 could be him. Is it possible to see photos of the area
 of exposure, as it were?'</p>

<p>Sally blinked, not quite sure she had heard
 correctly. 'I beg your pardon?'</p>

<p>'I am a nurse after all. And it might help.'</p>

<p>Danny Vine couldn't hold back a short laugh and
 Delaney glared at him. 'Wait outside, Constable.'</p>

<p>'Sir.' Danny hurried out of the room, shutting the
 door behind him.</p>

<p>Delaney turned back to Valerie Manners. 'I'm
 sorry, ma'am. But that won't be possible. It would be
 a procedural irregularity, I'm afraid.'</p>

<p>'It's just the injury. Very unlikely two people
 would have the same.'</p>

<p>Delaney took the photos off Sally and flicked
 through them quickly. 'What do you mean, the
 injury?'</p>

<p>'To his penis. Quite extensive scarring, and some
 deformation I would say.'</p>

<p>'What?' Delaney couldn't believe what he was
 hearing.</p>

<p>'It was quite noticeable.' She looked up at
 Delaney's surprised expression. 'I'm sorry. Didn't I
 mention that?'</p>

<p>'No, ma'am. You didn't.'</p>

<p>'Do you think it might be important?'</p>

<p>DI Jimmy Skinner was well aware that the chatter
 beneath him had stopped as soon as the clang of his
 hard leather shoes on the metal walkway echoed
 around the large building. He looked over the railing,
 down at the many prisoners who were scattered
 about the recreation area, their faces turned up to his
 momentarily and then back to what they had been
 doing. Noise filled the building again. The sound of
 caged men resigned to their fate. The truth was
 Jimmy Skinner felt a lot of empathy for them. They
 were all gamblers in the main, much like him. Jimmy
 recognised that, just like he had been in the past
 many, many times, these men had been fucked on the
 river. Deliverance they called it. The odds had been in
 his favour, it was science after all, but the cards had
 turned up and defied the odds and he had taken a bad
 beat. He himself had taken a lot of bad beats over the
 years, just like the men below. Someone had lost their
 nerve or a car had failed to start, or a family that
 should have been on holiday had cancelled at the last
 minute and were at home when they shouldn't have
 been. Bad beats all. Or the baddest beat of the lot:
 being born in the wrong part of London in the wrong
 kind of family. The kind of family that had no hope
 outside of crime. No hope because the system had
 fucked them on the river before they'd even been
 born, and now the only way out was by the gun or
 knife, or with a flame and a spike and a packet of
 temporary oblivion to trade. So he felt a kind of
 sympathy for them. Not for the rapists, mind, or the
 child abusers or the soulless killers. For them he'd
 have a rope waiting, see how the cards fell on the
 ultimate gamble of all.</p>

<p>The prison guard coughed and Jimmy Skinner
 turned back to him and carried on walking towards
 the open cell doors and put the men below out of his
 mind. One thing you learned playing poker was that
 you put the past behind you and moved on to your
 next game. Chasing losses was a sure way to
 destruction and Jimmy Skinner wasn't that kind of
 gambler. He didn't play to lose, he played to stay
 even, so he could play again.</p>

<p>The officer, a wide-set man in his forties with steel-grey
 hair and eyes as bereft of humour as a
 warehouse guard dog, stood by the open door of one
 of the cells and jerked with his thumb to show Jimmy
 the man inside.</p>

<p>Neil Riley was a scrawny, long-haired man in his
 early thirties, with skin the colour of church candles
 and tattoos covering both his arms. Tattoos that
 hadn't been modelled on any works of the great
 Renaissance artists as far as Jimmy Skinner could see.
 He was sat on his bed rolling a cigarette and looked
 up dispassionately as the policeman entered the cell.</p>

<p>Jimmy fished a new packet of cigarettes out of his
 pocket and threw it on the bed besides him. The man
 looked at it, a sneer quirking the corner of his thin-lipped
 mouth. 'You better do better than fucking
 that.'</p>

<p>Jimmy nodded then picked up the packet of
 cigarettes from the bed, put them in his pocket and
 slapped the man back-handed, hard across his face.</p>

<p>'The fuck you think you're doing? I got rights, you
 know.'</p>

<p>A snort of laugher came from the guard outside
 and Jimmy clicked his fingers to get the man's
 attention. 'First rule. You don't swear in my
 presence.'</p>

<p>'Fuck that.'</p>

<p>Jimmy hit him hard again, the other side of his face
 this time, open-palmed.</p>

<p>'Jesus Christ!'</p>

<p>Skinner hit him back-handed again. 'Or
 blaspheme.'</p>

<p>Neil Riley scrambled up on the bed, putting his
 back to the wall and held his hand up at Skinner. 'All
 right, you made your f—' He caught himself. 'You
 made your point.'</p>

<p>Skinner nodded. 'Good.'</p>

<p>'And I don't know what you want to see me for. I
 don't know anything about anything.'</p>

<p>'You know Kevin Norrell, don't you?'</p>

<p>'I knew him.'</p>

<p>Skinner leaned in pointedly. 'He isn't dead yet,
 Riley.'</p>

<p>The sallow-faced man looked surprised. 'I
 thought—'</p>

<p>'What did you think?'</p>

<p>'I heard he was dead, that's all.'</p>

<p>'And where did you hear that from?'</p>

<p>Riley shrugged. 'Word gets round. What do you
 think, this place is a Carmelite nunnery? You think
 nobody talks?'</p>

<p>Skinner was a little surprised, and ignoring his own
 rules, said, 'What do you know about the fucking
 Carmelites?'</p>

<p>'I went to a convent primary school.'</p>

<p>'I thought that was just for girls?'</p>

<p>'No. Some are mixed up to a certain age.'</p>

<p>Skinner caught himself. 'Can we get back to the
 fucking point here?'</p>

<p>'I was just saying.'</p>

<p>'Never mind all that bollocks, just tell me who told
 you Norrell was dead.'</p>

<p>'I don't know, what does it matter who told me?'</p>

<p>'Someone took five inches of sharpened steel and
 tried to make a shish kebab out of his organs with it.
 Maybe that was the guy who told you, that's what
 matters.'</p>

<p>Riley shook his head. 'Get real, Detective.
 Whoever did it is going to keep his mouth shut, isn't
 he?'</p>

<p>Skinner glared at him for a moment or two,
 resisting the urge to slap him hard around the head
 again just for the fun of it. 'Let's get back to the
 point, shall we?'</p>

<p>'Which is?'</p>

<p>'Which is: you were a friend of Kevin Norrell.'</p>

<p>'Says who?'</p>

<p>Skinner looked around the cell. 'You see anyone
 else standing in this fucking room?'</p>

<p>Riley shrugged again. 'I knew him a little.'</p>

<p>'Come off it, Riley. You think we don't read files?
 You grew up on the same estate as him. You've been
 busted together more than once. You knew the man.'</p>

<p>Riley hesitated for a moment, as if weighing up his
 options. Finally he said, 'Yeah, I knew him.'</p>

<p>'He's on remand. He gets to speak to people. And
 the information is that you and he were buddy-buddy
 in here.'</p>

<p>'Someone has to watch your back.'</p>

<p>'You did a good job of watching his.'</p>

<p>Riley held his skinny arms up. 'What good would
 I be? You know Norrell, he didn't need me riding on
 his wing.'</p>

<p>'So what did you do for him?'</p>

<p>'I've been here a while. I know who's who and
 what's what. I filled him in.'</p>

<p>'What was he going to tell Delaney?'</p>

<p>Riley pulled a face, so Skinner slapped him hard
 again. Sometimes he loved being a policeman. Riley
 yelped and the guard from outside looked in again.
 He grinned and nodded to Skinner with approval.</p>

<p>'For Christ's sake, what was that for?'</p>

<p>He flinched and pressed back against the wall as
 Skinner leaned in, but he didn't hit him this time. 'I'll
 ask the question again. What was he going to tell
 Delaney?'</p>

<p>Riley shook his head, agitated now. 'I honestly
 don't know. His court case was coming up soon.
 Preliminary hearings. He told me he had stuff on
 Chief Superintendent Walker. Maybe he was looking
 to make a deal.'</p>

<p>'He said it was about Delaney's wife.'</p>

<p>'He never said anything to me about it. But if he
 wanted to see Delaney that was a sure-fire way of
 getting him in.'</p>

<p>'What else would he want to see him for?'</p>

<p>Riley shook his head. 'Fuck knows, you're the
 detective.'</p>

<p>Some people just couldn't help themselves.</p>

<p>Paul Archer strode angrily down the steps,
 shrugging into his overcoat. The woman behind the
 reception desk smiled at him but he ignored her. She
 wasn't his type and he had taken the afternoon off
 for more particular distractions than the kind
 offered in idle badinage with insipid blondes. Paul
 Archer had the kind of itch that could only be
 scratched by a certain type of woman. And he knew
 just where to find her.</p>

<p>Delaney stood in front of the briefing room. On the
 board behind him were pinned the photographs
 taken of the dead woman they had found in the
 woods. Hampstead's very own Black Dahlia, he
 couldn't help thinking.</p>

<p>'All right, listen up.' Delaney raised his voice above
 the chatter that filled the room and conversations
 died as they focused their attention on the detective
 inspector. 'Now, as yet we don't have any ID on the
 woman. We think she was murdered sometime
 during last night. We're placing her age, give or take
 a few years, in her mid-twenties.'</p>

<p>'Was she killed in the woods, or dumped there?'
 Audrey Hobson, a uniformed inspector in her fifties,
 called out.</p>

<p>'Best we can tell, she was killed where we found
 her.'</p>

<p>'An opportunist killing, or was she taken there?'</p>

<p>'We don't know, Audrey. It was lousy weather. It
 was cold, windy, raining. It's unlikely she'd be in the
 woods alone at that time of night.'</p>

<p>PC Bob Wilkinson spoke out. 'It's possible. Like
 Sally said earlier. Maybe it's some witchcraft thing.
 She's dressed up as a goth. You know how some of
 them fruitcakes are. Lesbians and pagans, give them
 a full moon and they start believing all kind of
 bollocks. '</p>

<p>Diane Campbell glared at him. 'Not very helpful,
 Constable.'</p>

<p>Delaney stopped himself from smiling as he held
 his hand up to quell the beginnings of laughter in the
 room. 'Nothing's discounted. Most likely scenario is
 that she was taken there, though. Sex attackers don't
 usually hang around in rainstorms looking for
 victims.'</p>

<p>Sally Cartwright held up her hand. She looked like
 she should still be in school, Delaney thought, but
 was glad she wasn't. She may look like a Girl Guide,
 but he knew beneath that pretty exterior was what
 his North American colleagues would have called a
 tough cookie. He'd had to depend on her more than
 once and she hadn't let him down. 'Yes, Constable?'</p>

<p>'Is there anything in the database matching the
 MO?'</p>

<p>'Good question. We're running it through at the
 moment. Until we get the detailed post it's all rather
 general. No immediate hits.'</p>

<p>Diane Campbell stepped forward. 'What leads are
 you pursuing, Jack?'</p>

<p>'A flasher was operating early this morning, near
 the scene of the crime.'</p>

<p>'You think he was involved?'</p>

<p>'Unlikely. But he may have seen something.'</p>

<p>'You have a good ID on him?'</p>

<p>'Pretty good. This isn't a run-of-the-mill flasher.'</p>

<p>'Go on.'</p>

<p>Delaney produced a couple of A3 sheets of paper.
 He pinned the first on the wall. It showed an artist's
 rendition of a wild-haired man in his late twenties,
 early thirties. 'This is the man we're looking for, and
 this . . .' He hesitated before putting up the second
 picture. 'This is his penis.'</p>

<p>There was some wincing, some groaning and some
 laughter at the second picture that Delaney pinned on
 the board. An artist's rendition, blown up, from the
 nurse's description, of the man's scarred penis.</p>

<p>'Is that life-size?' Bob Wilkinson couldn't resist it,
 and now the laughter rippled round the room like a
 rumbling sea at high tide.</p>

<p>'All right, children, that's enough.' Diane
 Campbell's voice barked and the room fell silent.
 'Have a look at the picture over there.' She pointed at
 the dead woman's mutilated body. 'Any one of you
 find anything funny in that?' She looked pointedly at
 Bob Wilkinson.</p>

<p>'No, ma'am.'</p>

<p>Delaney's phone chose that moment to ring. He
 looked at the caller and shrugged apologetically at his
 boss. 'I've got to take this. I'll be right back.'</p>

<p>Delaney strode quickly from the briefing room
 before Diane Campbell could stop him and answered
 the call in the corridor outside. 'What have you got
 for me, Jimmy?'</p>

<p>On the other end of the phone, DI Jimmy Skinner's
 voice sounded thin and echoing, the sound of men in
 the background telling Delaney he was calling from
 the prison. 'Hi, Jack. I'm at Bayfield.'</p>

<p>'I gathered. Go on.'</p>

<p>'Nobody's talking. I put the hard word on Neil
 Riley, Norrell's old oppo, and according to him
 Kevin Norrell was taken down because of the kiddie
 porn.'</p>

<p>'You believe him?'</p>

<p>'I don't know, Jack. Something feels hinky.'</p>

<p>'You reckon it has anything to do with my wife?'</p>

<p>'Maybe. But you know as well as I do that you can
 trust Norrell as far as you could throw him one-handed.
 Which is ruddy nowhere. The guy's a timeserving
 prick of the first order.'</p>

<p>'Why lie about it?'</p>

<p>There was a pause and Delaney could picture
 Skinner shrugging at the other end of the line. 'The
 guy was desperate. That much seems clear. Whether
 it was because he knew there was a hit out on him, or
 about the trial coming up, who knows? His mate
 reckons that he had something on Chief Superintendent
 Walker, perhaps. He was looking to deal.
 Maybe talking about your wife was the best way to
 get you in to see him.'</p>

<p>'Maybe . . .' But Delaney wasn't convinced. Kevin
 Norrell had the brainpower of a fermented melon,
 but even he wouldn't be stupid enough to jerk
 Delaney's chain over his dead wife. Delaney glanced
 down at the stairs at the end of the corridor as the
 sound of high heels clicking rhythmically on the
 wooden steps grew louder. 'Keep on it, Jimmy.'</p>

<p>Delaney snapped his phone shut and looked across
 as Kate came up the stairs and headed towards the
 briefing room, unwrapping her scarf from her neck
 and taking off her gloves. If she was a little taken
 aback to see Delaney waiting outside the door, she
 didn't betray it in her body language. Delaney
 watched her confident stride, the determined set to
 her jaw, but in her eyes he saw something that
 disturbed him. Something that went against her
 usual, poised exterior. Something that reached out to
 him in a primal sense. Something very much like fear.</p>

<p>'Kate.'</p>

<p>'Not now, Jack.' She sailed past him.</p>

<p>Delaney hurried after her and took her arm. He
 was shocked to see the way she flinched away. 'I'm
 sorry.'</p>

<p>She looked at him, anger flaring behind the fear
 that was still liquid in her deep, brown eyes. 'Sorry
 for what exactly?'</p>

<p>Delaney hesitated. 'I didn't mean to startle you.'</p>

<p>Kate nodded, as if his answer had confirmed her
 thoughts, lessened him once again in her eyes, and he
 felt the shame of it like a creeping feeling on his skin.
 'I need to get to the meeting,' she said.</p>

<p>She opened the door and walked into the briefing
 room before Delaney had a chance to say anything
 more.</p>

<p>Jimmy Skinner was heading down the iron staircase
 to be taken back through to the reception area when
 Derek Watters, the guard who had been posted
 outside Neil Riley's cell, fell into step behind him. He
 spoke quietly.</p>

<p>'You want to know what was going down with
 Kevin Norrell?'</p>

<p>Skinner turned back to look at him but the guard
 gestured him on.</p>

<p>'Just keep walking. I'll talk to you about it, but not
 here and not for gratis.'</p>

<p>'What are you after?'</p>

<p>'A drink. A serious drink. I reckon Delaney's good
 for it.'</p>

<p>'When and where?'</p>

<p>They reached the bottom of the stairs.</p>

<p>'Six o'clock. The Pillars of Hercules. Soho.'</p>

<p>Skinner nodded, imperceptibly, as another guard
 approached.</p>

<p>'All right, Derek. I'll take him from here.'</p>

<p>Derek Watters slapped Skinner on the arm as the
 other guard led him away and back towards the
 entrance.</p>

<p>At four o'clock in the afternoon, it doesn't matter
 what time of year, Soho is a busy place. But the
 White Horse pub, just down the road from Walker's
 Court, was relatively quiet today; as quiet as it was
 most days during the week, after lunch and before the
 workers came off shift. Later on it would be bustling
 with the regulars who preferred the scruffy
 traditionalism of a proper London boozer to the
 trendy bars that had recently sprung up around Soho
 like mushrooms in an autumn wood. Soho took its
 name, most believed, from the old hunting cry <emphasis>Soho</emphasis>,
 much like the <emphasis>Tally ho</emphasis> that still sounds from blue-blooded
 lips up and down the shires, hunting ban or
 no. Less fanciful, perhaps, was that the name just
 came from a shortening of South Holborn.</p>

<p>The dark-haired man sitting on his own in the pub
 preferred the first version. As far as he was
 concerned, Soho was still a hunting ground. The best
 kind.</p>

<p>The White Horse was a pub he liked to drink in
 and watch people. A spit-and-sawdust bar with a
 dirty, wooden planked floor and a look about it as
 faded as an old man's shirt. The man liked it because
 he could look at the whores as they worked the street
 outside, and watch them closer when they came in for
 a nip of cheap vodka against the elements. Their
 skinny legs sometimes encased in fishnet stockings
 and knee-length boots, sometimes bare and cold in
 red leather shoes, their painted smiles cracking in the
 sudden warmth like old varnish as they took a brief
 respite from the cold outdoors.</p>

<p>At the moment, however, there were just a few
 tourists sheltering from the persistent rain and a
 couple of old men, seated separately and so far gone
 on strong beer that time meant nothing them. When
 they got up in the morning the pub was open and
 when they went home and collapsed the pub was
 open, and all that filled the hours in between waking
 and sleeping was the slow annihilation of thought,
 feeling and memory. Annihilation by the pint and
 shot glass.</p>

<p>The man seated at the round table by the entrance
 door watched the old men with contempt undisguised
 in his eyes. His right hand caressed his left
 wrist.</p>

<p>He looked up at the television set above the corner
 of the bar. He'd been watching the news now for
 over an hour. No mention of his own artistry that
 day on the heath. No mention at all. And that made
 him angry.</p>

<p>The woman reading the news was young, blonde
 and very pretty. The man took a sip of his drink and
 watched her lips moving, not listening to the words
 she was saying. It was all irrelevant. Her lips were
 full, coloured with a soft, strawberry-pink lipstick.
 He licked his own lips, as if he could taste hers.</p>

<p>He ran his finger around the circle of moisture on
 the cracked surface of the wooden table and something
 sparked in his eyes. Not anger, or self-pity, but
 desire. He looked up at the television screen again. At
 the face of Melanie Jones, the news reporter from Sky
 News, as she smiled at the camera and wittered on
 about the change in the weather and coastal erosion
 in some Norfolk village nobody had ever heard of.</p>

<p>It was clear they had no knowledge of what he had
 done. And it was equally clear that the police had
 failed to grasp the significance of it. He needed to go
 to work again. Sometimes it took two pieces of the
 puzzle for someone to see the connection. Sometimes
 it took more. Well, if they needed another piece, he'd
 give it to them. <emphasis>Can you see what it is yet?</emphasis> Art is
 nothing without an audience after all. He smiled to
 himself taking another sip of his drink and looked at
 the elderly man at the bar who was watching him
 with a curious look in his eye, after a moment or two
 the man looked away and turned his attention back
 to his pint of Guinness. Some things you didn't want
 to look at too closely.</p>

<p>Especially in London.</p>

<p>Kate Walker looked at the photographs on the wall.
 Pictures of a young woman, once vital, now lying on
 a cold shelf in the morgue. Anatomy of a murder. She
 looked at the cold savagery of the slashes on the
 woman's body and felt sick for her race.</p>

<p>Kate could feel the restlessness in the room behind
 her as she continued to look at the photos. But she
 needed a moment or two to collect herself. Her heart
 was racing, as it had been since morning, and her
 skin was clammy. She'd never felt like this before in
 one of these meetings. Some people were terrified
 talking to a large number of people, it was the top
 fear in the country, bigger even than spiders or
 snakes, but that had never been one of her phobias.
 She knew more than most people she ever met and
 didn't mind demonstrating it. It was a measure of just
 how rattled she was that she was nervous now. She
 took a breath or two and turned round and nodded
 to the assembled policemen and women. 'As you
 already know we're putting her age at mid-twenties.
 Time of death between one o'clock and two o'clock
 last night.'</p>

<p>The young constable who had been guarding the
 body from the prurient gaze of the public earlier in
 the morning raised his hand.</p>

<p>'Can I ask a question?'</p>

<p>'Of course,' Kate said. 'What is it, Constable?'</p>

<p>'How can you be so sure about the time of death?
 What are the signs?' Danny Vine asked, his notebook
 open and his pen ready.</p>

<p>Amusement rippled round the room. Kate glared at
 them. 'All right. Some of you know as much about
 forensic pathology as I do – in your own opinion. But
 for the benefit of those who don't, there are a number
 of ways of determining time of death. It's a science
 but it's not an exact science. Rigor mortis usually sets
 in about three or four hours after death with full
 rigor about twelve hours later. Our victim hadn't
 reached that stage yet. So that's one thing. Ambient
 temperature plays a part though. Three to four hours
 is the norm with mild temperatures.'</p>

<p>'It was brass monkeys last night, ma'am.'</p>

<p>'Yes, thank you, Constable Wilkinson. You're
 right, it was bloody cold last night so that skews our
 calculations. But there are other factors we can use.'
 She looked across to see Danny Vine was taking
 copious notes. Keen to be a detective, she reckoned.
 She took a sip of water to allow him to catch up.</p>

<p>'Other conditions factor in. The age of the body,
 how active the person was prior to death. If they were
 very active then rigor mortis can set in quicker. We
 don't know what this woman was doing prior to her
 murder but at that time of night we can assume she
 hadn't been jogging on the heath. So we look at other
 indicators.' She pointed to the photos mounted on
 the display panels.</p>

<p>'The heart, as you all know, is a muscle that pumps
 blood around the body. Once that pump stops
 working, at the time of death, blood collects in the
 most dependent parts of the body. That is livor
 mortis. Then the body stiffens, which is rigor mortis,
 and then with no heat being generated post mortem,
 the body begins to cool and this is the algor mortis
 stage.'</p>

<p>She pointed at the blue staining on the body of the
 dead woman. 'Blood will collect in those parts of the
 body that are in contact with the ground. Most
 commonly the back and the buttocks when the
 person is lying face up. The skin is pale because all
 the blood that keeps it pink drains into the larger
 veins. It can take minutes or hours after death, but
 livor mortis will manifest itself on the skin.'</p>

<p>She pointed to a close-up photograph of the discoloration
 on the woman's face. 'These purplish
 blemishes are what embalmers call post-mortem
 stain. It takes a few hours but after that the blood
 becomes what we call fixed. That is, it won't move to
 other parts of the body if the corpse is moved. So we
 can use that to also determine where the murder took
 place. And, in this instance, together with the other
 factors such as the arterial spray in the immediate
 area, we can say pretty definitely that the woman was
 killed in the place where she was discovered.'</p>

<p>Kate walked back to the desk and took another sip
 of water. She was aware that Delaney was watching
 her but determined to keep professional.</p>

<p>'There is a condition, at the time of death, known
 as primary flaccidity.'</p>

<p>'Bob Wilkinson knows all about that,' a female
 officer called out from the back of the room, and
 laughter erupted. Kate smiled, the grim photos on
 the wall behind were testament to the seriousness
 of the situation but the laughter didn't mean anyone
 in the room wasn't focused on the dead woman, and
 finding justice for her. Black humour was just a
 coping mechanism, after all.</p>

<p>She held up a hand. 'All right, settle down.
 Constable Wilkinson is already no doubt well aware
 that there are medications available on prescription
 for his particular ailment, so there is no need for
 embarrassment nowadays.'</p>

<p>Bob Wilkinson scowled, taking the ribbing in good
 heart.</p>

<p>Kate waited for the laughter to subside and then
 continued. 'A dead body will usually stay in full rigor
 mortis for anything between twenty-four and forty-eight
 hours. After that the muscles start to relax again
 and secondary laxity,' she smiled apologetically at
 Bob Wilkinson, 'or flaccidity occurs. And it will
 usually follow the same pattern as it began.' She
 gestured behind her. 'Not applicable in this case of
 course. Another way of gauging how long a person
 has been dead is by taking the core temperature. And
 again we have to factor in the ambient temperature.
 The unseasonably cold weather last night meant that
 the woman's body will have cooled a lot faster than
 if she had been murdered at home for example.
 Wherever her home is.'</p>

<p>Kate glanced back at the mottled face of the
 ravaged woman and wondered if anyone was waiting
 for her at that home. A distraught parent or worried
 boyfriend. She assumed she wasn't married as she
 had no wedding ring, or indications that she had ever
 worn one.</p>

<p>At the back of the room, meanwhile, Delaney was
 watching Kate as she pinned different photographs of
 the murdered young woman to the display board,
 and talked about the forensic analytical techniques.
 But those details washed over him, hardly taking in
 what she was saying. She was discussing putrefaction
 as another method of establishing time of death. But
 again it wasn't strictly relevant as putrefaction didn't
 take place until the second or third day after death
 and Delaney had seen enough corpses in his time to
 know about the telltale signs of green discoloration,
 and the putrid odour that accompanied it. An odour
 that told him they were already far too late for the
 victim and had given the murderer a good few days'
 head start on them. The first twenty-four hours were
 often critical in a murder case and if the body was
 putrefying before it was discovered it wasn't a good
 omen.</p>

<p>Kate turned to the room. 'We know the victim is a
 young female, we know she was murdered sometime
 in the early hours of last night and we know we are
 dealing with an extremely sick individual.'</p>

<p>A murmur went round the room again, sensing
 that Kate had finished but she held her hand up for
 quiet once again.</p>

<p>'One more thing.' She walked over to the display
 panels again and pointed at a blown-up photo of the
 young woman's neck. 'There is an unusual puncture
 mark on her neck.'</p>

<p>'Vampire you think, Doctor?'</p>

<p>A laugh went around the room again. But a
 nervous one. After all, the woman had been
 murdered in the dead of night, under a full moon,
 was dressed like someone out of Bram Stoker and
 had a couple of pagan symbols on her belt.</p>

<p>Kate let the laughter subside. 'I have no idea what
 to think.'</p>

<p>The previously recorded news highlights were playing
 on monitors throughout the building. Melanie
 Jones smiling at the camera. It was a practised smile,
 full of hope, innocence and genuine wonder at the
 world. A smile that belied the news that she had just
 been reporting. A third teenager stabbed to death in
 south London that week. An eighty-three-year-old
 woman raped and murdered in Nottingham. The
 foreclosure of a car works in the Midlands that was
 putting five thousand people out of work. At Sky
 News the policy was that the viewer should want to
 kiss the messenger not kill her. And a lot of people
 wanted to kiss Melanie Jones. The news is a bitter
 pill, after all, and Melanie Jones provided the sweet,
 sweet sugar that helped the medicine go down.</p>

<p>At the moment it was her line producer, Ronald
 Bliss, that was going down. His head nestled between
 her thighs as she sat legs akimbo on the toilet in the
 ensuite in his office. She wasn't smiling now. She was
 looking at her nails. There was a slight chip on her
 left index finger. She looked across at her handbag
 which was propped up against Ronald's knees. She'd
 have loved to get her polish out of it and fix the nail,
 but thought it might not go down too well. She
 looked at her watch. He'd been at it for five minutes,
 breathing heavily through his nostrils and sounding
 like a St Bernard in labour. Bliss was five foot six and
 several stones overweight and Melanie hoped the
 heavy breathing wasn't a prelude to a heart attack.
 She looked down at the top of his head; he was only
 thirty-eight but already his hair was thinning badly.
 She could see the pink of his scalp through the
 strands of his ginger hair, and frowned slightly.
 Someone should tell him about dandruff shampoo,
 but that was his wife's job, not hers. She looked at
 her watch again, she'd give him a couple more
 minutes for form's sake then make a few whimpering
 noises and give him a quick wank, which should keep
 him happy for a week or so and her own promotion
 prospects on line.</p>

<p>A buzzing in her jacket pocket and then her phone
 rang. She took it out and was about to click it off
 when the man below mumbled, 'Answer it, I like to
 hear your voice.'</p>

<p>Melanie curled her lip at him and answered the
 phone, suppressing a yawn.</p>

<p>'Melanie Jones.'</p>

<p>She listened for a while and then went very still.
 'Call me back in fifteen minutes. I can't talk now.'
 She closed her phone and patted her producer on his
 head, just once and wiped her palm on the sleeve of
 her jacket.</p>

<p>'Sorry, Ronald, I think I just came on.'</p>

<p>The man looked up, a shifty tremor in his glassine
 eyes. 'I don't mind.'</p>

<p>'Next week, eh.' She shifted her thighs, squeezing
 him backward and leaned over to pick her thong.
 Silk, diamanté-studded, eighty-five pounds from
 Agent Provacateur. She stood up and the man looked
 at her hopefully.</p>

<p>'Could you at least leave me the knickers?'</p>

<p>The call she had just received could very well turn
 out to be the best break of her career and so she was
 suddenly feeling very generous. She tossed them into
 his eager hand.</p>

<p>'I want them replaced.'</p>

<p>She closed the door behind her. The look of
 gratitude in her boss's eyes was proof, if she needed
 it, of just how weak men can be.</p>

<p>Kate walked down the corridor, wrapping the long
 scarf around her neck and heading for the stairs. She
 was happy to have put the briefing behind her, her
 mind wasn't on it. Much as she felt for the murdered
 woman, she had her own problems today. She
 headed down the broad staircase and walked to the
 police surgeon's room. She dreaded what she was
 about to hear. When she had worked as a police
 surgeon Kate had had to deal with many cases of
 rape. She knew that the cases reported were just the
 tip of the iceberg too. She'd been giving a lecture not
 many weeks past addressing the issue. She'd been
 horrified to look at the women against rape website
 and seen that if anything the situation was getting
 worse year by year. Ninety-eight per cent of domestic
 violence goes unreported. Two women a week
 murdered by their partner or ex-partner. One in six
 women in the country has been raped and yet only
 six per cent of reported rapes result in a conviction.
 And now, most likely, she was one of the statistics.
 She had no evidence that the man in her bed had
 assaulted her last night; it was a gut feeling, and the
 news that he had done it before just made her all the
 more certain that she had been violated. The thought
 of it made her feel nauseous again, her stomach
 lurching as though she were on a particularly choppy
 Channel crossing. She paused at the water cooler
 outside the police surgeon's office to take a drink and
 try and stop herself from hurling her lunch on the
 smooth tiles of the corridor.</p>

<p>Melanie Jones was standing outside in the car park of
 the London Apprentice. She was holding a large glass
 of red wine in her left hand and a Lambert &amp; Butler
 Superking dangled from her perfectly painted lips.</p>

<p>'Shit,' she said looking at her mobile phone, which
 was staying frustratingly quiet. 'Ring, you bastard!'
 She sucked in a lungful of smoke and paced over to
 look at the river.</p>

<p>The recent heavy falls of rain had sluiced mud from
 the banks of either side of the Thames, and the strong
 winds had stripped dead leaves and detritus from Eel
 Pie Island, further upriver, to wash down and swirl in
 the dirty, brown water. Melanie looked at it, her lip
 curling. Bloody thing was like an open sewer. It was
 a metaphor for London she thought, she couldn't
 wait to put the stinking city behind her. The phone
 call earlier though, if it was genuine, was a career-making
 opportunity and could have her in America
 sooner than you could say world exclusive. That had
 been her ambition ever since she had done a
 presenting course at Bournemouth University a few
 years ago. She was born for Fox News. As a teenager
 she had wanted to be a model, but she was too curvy
 as an adult, too womanly. Her legs were long for a
 woman but too short for a supermodel. She'd taken
 Ulrika Jonsson as her inspiration. So she had started
 off as a weather girl before being talent-spotted by a
 Sky News journo at a fund-raiser for victims of the
 Boxing Day Tsunami. She'd rogered him senseless
 that night on a king-size waterbed and as a
 consequence he had made the right calls for her and
 just like that she was in with Rupert Murdoch. Not
 that she'd ever met the man, but maybe all that
 would change, and soon. The phone buzzed in her
 hand and she almost dropped it, her palms suddenly
 moist with perspiration. She already had the title of
 her book in mind. <emphasis>Intimate Conversations With a
 Serial Killer</emphasis>.</p>

<p>She took a deep breath and pushed the answer
 button, her voice like gunpowder soaked in honey.</p>

<p>'Melanie Jones. Talk to me.'</p>

<p>Caroline Akunin was standing at her window drinking
 a cup of white tea when Kate walked into her
 office. She found herself standing a lot more often
 these days, the baby was definitely making its
 presence felt. Sitting behind the sturdy police desk for
 any long periods of time was just not possible any
 more. She ran a thoughtful hand across her stomach
 and smiled sympathetically at Kate as she came in
 through the open door.</p>

<p>'I hope I haven't kept you waiting?' Kate asked.</p>

<p>'Of course not.' The police surgeon's perfect teeth
 flashed in a dazzling smile.</p>

<p>'I had a briefing to attend first. It went on longer
 than I thought.'</p>

<p>Caroline Akunin gestured to the chair in front of
 her desk as Kate shut the door behind her. 'Why
 don't you sit down, Kate?'</p>

<p>Kate sat in the chair and gestured at the woman's
 prominent belly. 'How's it going? The pregnancy.' It
 seemed to her an inane thing to say but suddenly she
 wanted to talk about anything other than the reason
 she had come. Now she was sitting in the police
 surgeon's office she didn't want to hear anything that
 would confirm her worst fears. If you don't name the
 bogeyman he can't get you, after all. That's what her
 mother had always told her. But, as in a lot of things,
 she had lied.</p>

<p>Caroline smiled again; Kate could easily see why
 her Russian husband had fallen in love with her. 'You
 know how it is. The first nine months are the worst.'</p>

<p>Kate forced herself to return the smile. The truth
 was she had no idea how it was. Motherhood was
 not high on Kate's agenda. Just thinking about the
 modern world, the pollution, the global warming, the
 disaffected hopelessness and the violence of youth,
 the gun deaths and knifings, the rape, assault and
 mutilation of women throughout the country, the
 fear, as essential and as constant a part of London life
 now as the Victorian smog used to be, and she didn't
 think it ever would be. Who would want to bring a
 child into this world? But as she looked at her friend
 Caroline's beatific face, a living sculpture in maternal
 happiness, she knew she could never convey the
 darkness of her thoughts to her, so she changed the
 subject back to what she feared the most.</p>

<p>'What can you tell me about what happened last
 night?'</p>

<p>Caroline Akunin sighed and pulled another chair
 across closer to her friend. 'I can tell you what our
 tests have shown so far.'</p>

<p>'Go on.'</p>

<p>'There are no physical signs of rape. No bruising,
 no abrasion.'</p>

<p>'I know that.'</p>

<p>'Of course, sorry.'</p>

<p>'Don't apologise, Caroline. Just tell me straight. I
 need to know.'</p>

<p>'Okay. Well, there are no pubic hairs.'</p>

<p>'None at all?'</p>

<p>'Just yours, Kate.'</p>

<p>'And there are no traces of semen?'</p>

<p>'None.'</p>

<p>Kate blew out a sigh. 'Thank God for that, at
 least.'</p>

<p>'I guess.'</p>

<p>Kate leaned her head back and looked at the
 ceiling. 'Doesn't mean, of course, that nothing
 happened.'</p>

<p>'No, it doesn't.'</p>

<p>'Any traces of lubricant?'</p>

<p>'Nope.'</p>

<p>'Lubricant- and spermicide-free condoms are
 readily available.'</p>

<p>Caroline nodded. 'Let's face it, Kate, he could have
 put a condom through a dishwasher before he used it.'</p>

<p>'Reused. Nice image.'</p>

<p>Caroline shrugged sympathetically.</p>

<p>'Don't tell me there's traces of Fairy Liquid power-ball?'
 She tried to smile but couldn't manage it this
 time.</p>

<p>'There's nothing, Kate.'</p>

<p>'What about date-rape drugs? Rohypnol, one of
 those?'</p>

<p>'I'm still waiting on the blood work.'</p>

<p>Kate clenched her hand angrily. 'There must be
 something he used, Caroline. Something has to show
 up. If this was taken to the CPS they'd laugh in our
 faces.'</p>

<p>'Let's see what the blood tests show.'</p>

<p>'You said he's already been charged?'</p>

<p>'Cautioned, charged, released on police bail and
 due in court this week.'</p>

<p>'Can you give me the details?'</p>

<p>Caroline stood up and shook her head sadly.
 'Sorry, Kate. You know I can't do that. Completely
 against the rules. Client confidentiality and all that.
 Not to mention that it could jeopardise the case.'</p>

<p>Kate looked up at her, sensing there was something
 she wasn't saying.</p>

<p>Caroline smiled apologetically. 'You'll have to
 excuse me for a moment. One of the downsides of
 being pregnant is that you have to go to the loo every
 five minutes.'</p>

<p>'Okay.'</p>

<p>'I might be some time.' She grinned at Kate again,
 more broadly this time. 'Why don't you make yourself
 at home? Read something.' She gestured at her
 desk on which were stacked a pile of magazines and
 a single, blue folder. Kate looked at the name on the
 folder, <emphasis>Helen Archer</emphasis>, and smiled gratefully back up
 at the police surgeon.</p>

<p>'Thanks, Caroline.'</p>

<p>'Take your time.'</p>

<p>Caroline left and Kate pulled the folder towards
 her, took out the documents and started to read.</p>

<p>Helen Archer's hand shook slightly as she went into
 her house, closed her front door behind her and
 double locked it. On the way back home, with the
 wind howling and throwing the fallen leaves against
 her bare legs, she had jumped at every barking dog or
 creaking tree branch, flexing its long, skeletal fingers
 as though deliberately taunting her.</p>

<p>She walked across the polished oak floor of her
 hallway, kicking off her low-heeled shoes and letting
 her feet sink comfortably in the luxurious pile of the
 cream-coloured carpet in her lounge. She went
 straight to the walnut sideboard next to the
 fireplace, poured herself a large brandy and took a
 healthy swig. It was expensive brandy, as smooth as
 the silk on her bed upstairs, but she still gasped a
 little as it went down. Coughing and catching her
 breath she took another sip, slower this time, and
 felt the warmth of it spread through her body. She
 crossed over to her curtains and pulled them shut,
 then switched on a couple of side lamps and dimmed
 the main light. A red light was blinking on the
 answerphone on top of the coffee table in front of an
 enormous, red, buffalo-hide sofa, something her ex-husband
 insisted they buy and she hadn't got round
 to replacing. Its overwhelming size was a constant
 reminder of him. She punched the play button on
 the answerphone. It was his voice again and her
 fingers tightened on her brandy glass, her knuckles
 white.</p>

<p>'Don't be like this, Helen. We need to talk. We
 need to sort things out.' His voice was calming,
 soothing. As though he were talking to one of his
 patients. 'Call me back. You don't want to make me
 angry.' And there was steel in his voice now.
 Unsheathed. Brutal.</p>

<p>She clicked the phone off, ignoring the blinking
 light that signalled there were many more messages.</p>

<p>She drained her brandy and then poured another,
 sipping at it as she looked at herself in the large, gilt
 mirror that was above the fireplace. She flicked her
 hair from side to side and ran her fingers softly
 through her thick tresses. It was honey-blonde again,
 the same colour as it had been at twenty-six when she
 had first met Paul. Not entirely her natural colour,
 but not far off it. He had asked her to change it in the
 early days and she had refused. But he had asked time
 and again, and by that time she had found herself
 falling in love with him. And it wasn't such a big
 deal, was it? Only a hair colour. She had dyed it a
 deep brunette, the colour he wanted. The colour of
 one of those women from the original <emphasis>Charlie's
 Angels</emphasis>. And she quite liked it at first. Made her look
 like a different person. Like putting on a mask. But
 the collar and cuffs hadn't matched he'd said. The
 curtains and the carpet. He thought he was so
 damned amusing. So he had made her shave her body
 hair. Shaved quite nude, just like he did himself. He
 had told her that it was for health reasons. She
 laughed drily as she remembered his words, but she
 knew better than that. It was because he thought it
 made his cock look bigger, that was the simple truth.
 The brandy was chasing away her nerves and
 replacing them with anger. How could she have been
 so wrong about a person? How could she have
 thought she loved him? He'd seemed so gentle with
 children, and she always thought that he wanted
 some of his own. That was one of the reasons why
 she married him. She'd always wanted a family and
 she had made that clear to any man who ever wanted
 to get serious with her. At the age of twelve she had
 known how many children she wanted and that
 hadn't changed since. She took another sip of her
 brandy and unconsciously rubbed her stomach as she
 looked down at the flickering flames roaring hungrily
 around the logs now.</p>

<p>It wasn't long after the honeymoon that the
 excuses started. It was always his career, a new
 posting, a promotion. Just as everything was settled
 and he promised they could start a family, he got
 offered something new. More money to pay for
 school fees, he had said, and it meant they had had to
 move to London. Then there was a new house to
 find, and to decorate and renovate. And the new job
 meant he had to focus on that so the family would
 have to wait for another short while. And that short
 while became a year and then another year. Then one
 day Helen realised she was well into her thirties and
 he was never going to change.</p>

<p>Except he did.</p>

<p>He became violent. She swallowed more of the
 brandy, its taste bitter in the back of her throat now.
 She felt a little disorientated, her eyes momentarily
 out of focus, and she suddenly felt hot, a little giddy.
 She put the back of hand on her forehead and it was
 damp with perspiration.</p>

<p>'Overdoing it on the brandy again?'</p>

<p>She spun around, her mouth open in shock, her
 arm dropping, spilling the brandy from her glass into
 the rich pile of the carpet.</p>

<p>'How did you get in?' Her voice trembled as she
 looked at the man in front of her.</p>

<p>'I always kept a spare key in the garden shed. If
 you didn't want me here you should have changed
 the locks.'</p>

<p>'Get out!' Helen screamed at him and threw the
 brandy glass. The man laughed as it missed him by
 five feet and smashed against her new Liberty-print
 wallpaper that she had always wanted but had never
 been allowed.</p>

<p>Paul Archer shook his head, the laughter in his eyes
 dying in an instant. 'Seems like you never learn,
 Helen. No matter how many lessons you're given,
 you never learn. But as someone once remarked . . .
 repetition is an excellent learning tool.'</p>

<p>Helen shook with terror as Paul Archer moved
 towards her. She tried to get away but she could only
 make a few steps towards the door and then her legs
 wouldn't move, her muscles useless, she felt her knees
 buckle and she slid, almost in slow motion, to the
 floor. She tried to get up but couldn't. She watched
 helpless as her ex-husband looked down on her as he
 took off his shirt, which he folded neatly and put on
 the sofa, then unbuckled his belt and lowered his
 trousers. She tied to move backwards but couldn't.
 She could barely scream as he stood above her naked,
 stroking himself with his right hand, hardening. Her
 eyes flicked to the right, to the broken brandy glass,
 lying against the wall. If she could just reach that she
 could take that smile off his face for good.</p>

<p>Delaney leaned against the wall in the small entrance
 to South Hampstead station watching the commuters
 as they spilled out of the lift and bustled for the exit.
 A couple of uniforms were waiting outside and Sally
 Cartwright stood next to Delaney looking at her
 watch. Across from them was the ticket office and
 station master's room. The door opened and an
 angry-looking man, with dark, wavy hair and an
 accent spooned with silver, glared across at them.</p>

<p>'Haven't you people got anything better to do?'</p>

<p>Simon Elliot, a police surgeon in his thirties, came
 out behind him and shook his head at Jack. He
 wasn't the one they were looking for. Delaney
 shrugged at the angry man with the posh voice and
 held his hands out apologetically.</p>

<p>'We're just doing a job here.'</p>

<p>'Your family must be very proud of you.'</p>

<p>The man walked off in a huff and Sally looked at
 her watch again.</p>

<p>'Keen to be somewhere, Constable?'</p>

<p>'Like I said earlier, we're having a drink a bit later.
 You're welcome to join us.'</p>

<p>Delaney looked at her deadpan. 'You know me,
 Sally. I don't drink during the week.'</p>

<p>'Just a bit of a headache was it this morning, sir? A
 migraine?'</p>

<p>'Along those lines.'</p>

<p>Delaney listened as another train pulled out of the
 tunnel many feet below, feeling the ground vibrate
 beneath his feet, and watched the indicator that
 showed another lift was on its way up. So far they
 had interviewed two of the three potential suspects
 identified by Valerie Manners and had no luck with
 either of them. Any resemblance to the flasher on the
 heath's southern common disappeared below buckle
 level.</p>

<p>Kate felt nauseous as she finished reading the statement.
 Helen Archer explaining in clinical detail the
 assault her ex-husband had made on her. No, not
 assault, she corrected herself mentally, the rape. As
 she read the clinical words she could picture all too
 clearly in her mind what had happened. Helen
 suspected that Paul Archer had laced her brandy with
 some sort of sedative, some kind of date-rape drug.
 But the levels hadn't been strong enough, clearly, as
 she could still remember what had happened. She had
 remembered being powerless as he had knelt beside
 her on the carpet, lifting her legs apart, raising her
 skirt, taking off her underwear and violating her as
 she tried desperately for her limbs to work again.
 And finally they had. As she recognised the telltale
 signs, the little mewing noises, the tightening of his
 buttocks, the widening of his eyes as he sucked his
 breath quickly in over his teeth, his wife had
 summoned enough strength to jerk his body
 sideways, off her and out of her and shuffled away
 like an injured crab as he jerked in spasm and came,
 spilling his seed into the carpet.</p>

<p>Evidence.</p>

<p>The lift doors opened and about thirty or so people
 came out into the small concourse that formed both
 the entrance and exit to Hampstead station. Delaney
 was relieved to see that their third suspect looked to be
 among them, although he could only see his curly,
 brown hair. He had his head down reading the
 <emphasis>Evening Standard</emphasis>, but he looked up as the group
 spilled though the lift doors. He was an IC1 male, in
 his early thirties, wearing a charcoal-grey suit and his
 eyes flashed with shock and then anger as he saw
 Delaney. They recognised each other almost immediately.
 Delaney knew he was not one of the men in
 the security footage that Valerie Manners had identified
 as a possible suspect. But he looked a little like
 him, even though his hair was far longer and curlier
 than it had been when Delaney had last seen him.</p>

<p>The man looked ahead, saw the uniforms chatting
 outside on the street and, panicking, he grabbed a
 young woman and shoved her straight at Delaney
 and Sally Cartwright then took off at a run, out of
 the exit and down the street, flashing past the
 uniforms.</p>

<p>Delaney left the detective constable to pick the
 young woman up and went after the man, shouting
 at the officers to follow as he raced up the street.</p>

<p>The man ahead shouldered past a couple of people
 waiting at the bus stop, the briefcase in his hand
 waving wildly as he ran pell-mell towards the road
 that led to the common and the southern reaches of
 the heath.</p>

<p>Delaney breathed heavily, his lungs on fire, feeling
 the muscles in his thighs burn as he hammered his
 legs down on the hard pavement. He swerved around
 the people waiting at the bus stop and shouted for the
 man to stop.</p>

<p>He didn't.</p>

<p>Delaney cursed through panted breath and picked
 his pace up. He was beginning to regret his two visits
 to Roy's burger van. A bacon sandwich or two is one
 thing going down, it's an altogether different thing
 coming up, and if he didn't catch the guy sprinting
 ahead of him soon he was either going to throw up
 or have a heart attack, probably both.</p>

<p>He spurted forward, blowing fast now. Christ on a
 bicycle he needed to do more exercise. He flicked his
 eyes heavenward in the slightest gesture of apology
 for the blasphemy of his thoughts then dived forward
 to rugby-tackle the man round his legs and bring him
 down hard on the pavement.</p>

<p>At school Delaney was considered a great prospect
 for the game. Natural speed combined with courage
 bordering on stupidity, a keen intelligence and the
 ability to read the play on the hoof made him a
 superstar of school rugby in his early teens. As he
 grew older and taller and filled out in the shoulders,
 he was not only playing with boys much older than
 himself, he was playing better than them. There was
 talk of national trials. But then, at the age of fifteen,
 Delaney discovered girls and his ambitions for glory
 on the muddy field were swapped for ambitions of a
 more comfortable kind, and certainly not of a team
 nature. He played his last game of rugby when he
 was eighteen years old and so it was more than
 twenty years since he'd practised the move.</p>

<p>He missed the man entirely.</p>

<p>Smashing down on to the cold, slick pavement he
 cried out and skidded forward like a clubbed seal on
 ice, his right shoulder wrenched out of its socket
 again, a recurring legacy of a motorcycle accident in
 his mid-twenties.</p>

<p>The man ahead turned back to look, the smile on
 his face and the smart remark on his lips quickly
 dying as Sally Cartwright charged up to him and, not
 bothering with the technical rules of the game
 Delaney had once played, tackled him high,
 wrapping her arm round his neck and pulling him
 violently to the ground. At Twickenham she might
 have got a yellow card, in South Hampstead she got
 a shout of encouragement from the two uniformed
 officers who followed closely behind and grabbed the
 man, pulled him roughly to his feet and cuffed him.</p>

<p>Delaney took a moment or two to catch his breath,
 his face like a satisfied shepherd's sunset.</p>

<p>'You all right, boss?'</p>

<p>Delaney got to his knees, his right arm dangling
 uselessly by his side, and looked up at Sally, who was
 grinning a little too broadly for his liking, and gasped
 hoarsely. 'I wore him out for you.'</p>

<p>'Course you did, sir.'</p>

<p>Delaney stood fully up, dusted the wet leaves
 from his trousers with his good hand and walked
 over to where the tackled man was watching him,
 amused.</p>

<p>'I take it you don't play for the London Irish,
 Delaney?'</p>

<p>'I play on the only team that counts, you little
 shite.'</p>

<p>The man winked at Sally and indicated Delaney.
 'You get to an age and suddenly you can't perform, if
 you know what I mean.'</p>

<p>Sally smiled back. 'Oh yeah, and how's your
 performance been of late?'</p>

<p>'I've had no complaints, darling.'</p>

<p>Sally pretended to be surprised. 'Really? Only an
 elderly nurse we were talking to earlier said you
 could only manage to fly the flag at half mast this
 morning.'</p>

<p>The guy looked over at Delaney. 'What's she on
 about?'</p>

<p>Sally turned to her boss. 'Do you know him then,
 sir?'</p>

<p>Delaney nodded. 'This here is Andy Ware. Aka
 Chemical Andy. Small-time drugs dealer, full-time
 pain in the arse. The last time I saw him he had a
 skinhead haircut. Peroxide blond.'</p>

<p>'Yeah, well, you got to move with the times,
 haven't you? I do a lot of business with the brothers
 nowadays . . .' Correcting himself. '<emphasis>Did</emphasis> a lot of
 business. All behind me now of course. I've gone
 legit.'</p>

<p>Sally looked him up and down, unimpressed.
 'What's up then, Chemical? Couldn't you get hold of
 any Viagra? Or was it just too cold for you this
 morning?'</p>

<p>'The fuck are you talking about, woman?'</p>

<p>Sally gestured towards his groin. 'The little man,
 flashing it on the heath this morning, were you?'</p>

<p>'I haven't been flashing anything.' He swirled his
 hips. 'And let me tell you, there ain't nothing little
 about this baby.'</p>

<p>'What are you doing here, Andy?' Delaney cut him
 short.</p>

<p>'I live here. Last I knew that ain't a crime.'</p>

<p>'You caught the train just after eight this morning.
 What have you been doing all day?'</p>

<p>'Working. Like I say, I'm out of the life.'</p>

<p>'Working at what? Somehow I can't see you as an
 estate agent.'</p>

<p>'Like I give a fuck what you see me as.'</p>

<p>Delaney leaned in. 'We can do this down the nick
 if you prefer it?'</p>

<p>The man shrugged. 'Community service.'</p>

<p>'What?'</p>

<p>'With the CAB, helping people with their finances.'</p>

<p>Delaney turned to Sally. 'He's a semi-qualified
 accountant. Left university with a degree, a bad
 haircut and a habit.'</p>

<p>'Fuck the habit, I left university with fifteen
 thousand pounds' worth of student loans to pay off.'</p>

<p>Sally flashed him a less than sympathetic look. 'So,
 you're telling us you weren't flashing the wiener this
 morning.'</p>

<p>Chemical Andy flashed his teeth again and pumped
 his groin forward. 'I told you, sweet cheeks, this here
 ain't no chipolata. I'm talking jumbo sausage,
 darling, you bring your own sauce.'</p>

<p>Delaney glared at him. 'Just answer the question.'</p>

<p>'What, you serious? You think I'm some kind of
 pervert?'</p>

<p>Sally nodded. 'Yeah. We do. Why did you take off
 when you saw us otherwise?'</p>

<p>Andy Ware shook his head. 'Because I know the
 way you people work. You be putting something on
 me.'</p>

<p>His eyes slid sideways a little, not holding
 Delaney's gaze.</p>

<p>Delaney sighed and turned to Sally. 'Look in his
 briefcase.'</p>

<p>Andy Ware struggled futilely against the grip of the
 uniformed officers as Sally opened the case.</p>

<p>'No way, man. That's my private property. That's
 cold, man. You got no cause. You got no right.'</p>

<p>Sally opened the briefcase and pulled out several
 packs of white powder. 'And you got the right to
 remain silent.'</p>

<p>'Fuck that.'</p>

<p>'And the right to brag about the size of you hot dog
 to the boys of E Wing. I'm sure they'll have plenty of
 sauce for you.'</p>

<p>Delaney nodded to the uniforms. 'Take him to the
 car.'</p>

<p>The uniforms led him off cursing. Sally smiled and
 looked at Delaney. 'You think he's good for it?'</p>

<p>'Doubt it somehow.'</p>

<p>'So where does that leave us?'</p>

<p>Delaney let out a long painful sigh and let the pain
 show on his face. 'In need of a drink.'</p>

<p>'What's up, boss?'</p>

<p>'I've dislocated my shoulder.'</p>

<p>'Shall I take you down to the hospital?'</p>

<p>Delaney held his right hand out, wincing. 'Just take
 my arm, both hands, and hold it tight.'</p>

<p>'Sir?'</p>

<p>'Just do it, Sally.'</p>

<p>Sally, puzzled, did as she was asked.</p>

<p>Delaney took a quick, sharp breath then wrenched
 his shoulder, snapping it back into place. 'Jesus,
 Mary, and all the sweet saints!' He staggered backwards,
 Sally still clinging to his arm. 'All right, you
 can let go now.'</p>

<p>Sally released her grip and Delaney put his left
 hand against a lamp post.</p>

<p>'You all right, sir?</p>

<p>Delaney nodded at her, breathing deeply. 'You get
 off to the pub, I'll process laughing boy back at the
 factory.'</p>

<p>'You going to join us later?'</p>

<p>'Yeah, I reckon I've earned a pint today.'</p>

<p>'Or twenty.'</p>

<p>'You're getting the idea.'</p>

<p>He watched Sally walk away, waited until she had
 turned the corner then staggered to a bus shelter,
 leaning against it with his good arm, fighting
 hard not to throw up as he took great gulping
 breaths and waited for the agony in his shoulder to
 subside.</p>

<p>Kate closed Helen Archer's file and pushed it to the
 back of the desk as Caroline Akunin came into the
 room. 'When's the trial coming up?'</p>

<p>'A few days.'</p>

<p>'Not easy for her. Having to relive that all over
 again in court.'</p>

<p>Caroline sat opposite her and took her hands.
 'How are you doing?'</p>

<p>Kate shook her head, blinking back tears.</p>

<p>'He's not going to get away with it.'</p>

<p>Kate gestured at the blue folder. 'How confident
 are the CPS on this?'</p>

<p>Caroline shrugged. 'As confident as they can be in
 these cases. There is physical evidence.'</p>

<p>'That he drugged her?'</p>

<p>'Not of that. But bruising. DNA. Semen secretions
 on the carpet.'</p>

<p>'So he'll go down for it? For her at least?'</p>

<p>'He claims it was consensual. That she said she
 regretted the split. She asked him round, they drank
 a lot of brandy and then made love on the carpet in
 front of the fire.'</p>

<p>'You're joking?'</p>

<p>'No. He admits it was rough sex, but entirely consensual.
 It's what you would expect him to say, Kate.
 You know that. If he is going to deny rape, then he
 has to play the consensual card, given the physical
 evidence.'</p>

<p>'So it's his word against hers?'</p>

<p>Caroline nodded sadly. 'Always is. That's why
 only six per cent of them get prosecuted successfully.'</p>

<p>The phone on Caroline's desk rang and Kate
 gestured towards it. 'You better get it.'</p>

<p>Caroline answered the phone. 'Hello. Speaking.'
 She listened for a while. 'Okay, thank you.'</p>

<p>He face was impassive but Kate could see something
 was worrying her as she hung up the phone.
 'Bad news?'</p>

<p>'It's your blood work, Kate.'</p>

<p>'Go on.'</p>

<p>'There's no evidence of Rohypnol.'</p>

<p>'Which doesn't mean to say there wasn't any.'</p>

<p>'No, of course not. Depending on the strength of
 whatever it was he used, it could have been flushed
 through your blood and out of your system before
 the tests.'</p>

<p>'I know.'</p>

<p>'There's something else . . .' Caroline hesitated.</p>

<p>'What?'</p>

<p>'You're pregnant, Kate.'</p>

<p>Delaney pulled his car into the White City car
 park, and, as he stepped out of it, he had to shield
 his eyes from a bright light suddenly shining at
 him.</p>

<p>Melanie Jones from Sky News stepped forward,
 smiling like an evangelist, and looked over at the
 long-haired cameraman who had his video camera on
 his shoulder and pointed straight at the policeman as
 though to launch an RPG. 'We running?' she asked
 him.</p>

<p>The cameraman nodded and Melanie turned back
 to face Delaney. 'Melanie Jones, Sky News. What can
 you tell us, Detective Inspector Delaney, about the
 dead woman who was found on South Hampstead
 Heath this morning?'</p>

<p>Delaney was too long in the tooth to be caught on
 the back foot like that. 'It's an ongoing investigation,
 I'm afraid. I'm not in a position to comment at
 present.'</p>

<p>'Sky News has learned that there was mutilation of
 the body. Was this the work of a serial killer?'</p>

<p>'When we have information, we'll call a press
 conference.' He made the words a dismissal.</p>

<p>Melanie Jones called after him as he walked away.
 'What is the significance of the belt buckle, Inspector?'</p>

<p>Delaney's turned back to look at her, his eyes
 hardened. 'I beg your pardon?'</p>

<p>'The Green Man belt buckle? What's so special
 about it?'</p>

<p>Delaney walked towards the police station
 entrance. 'Come with me.'</p>

<p>Melanie enjoyed matching her long stride to his.
 His reaction had pretty much told her that her source
 was genuine. The cameraman dropped his camera
 from his shoulder and followed at a more sedate
 pace. Delaney walked through reception and up to
 the security door. He quickly typed in the code on the
 small pad and opened the door. Melanie Jones
 walked through, but as the cameraman went to
 follow Delaney blocked his path. 'Not you.' He
 called across to the desk sergeant. 'Keep an eye on
 him for me, will you, Dave?</p>

<p>Slimline Matthews nodded tersely and came
 around from behind the desk, showing his massive
 frame. 'Sure thing, Jack.'</p>

<p>Delaney closed the door behind him.</p>

<p>'What the hell do you think you're doing?' The
 reporter's normally smooth voice had nothing honey-like
 about it any more.</p>

<p>'Come with me.' Delaney took her none too gently
 by the arm and marched her along the corridor. He
 opened the door to an interview room and pushed
 her into it, closing the door behind him and leaning
 against it. He crossed his arms. 'Start talking.'</p>

<p>'No, I won't start talking. Who the hell do you
 think you are?'</p>

<p>'My name is Jack Delaney. I'm a policeman.'</p>

<p>Melanie snorted. 'I know who you are, for fuck's
 sake, what I want to know is what the hell you think
 you're doing?'</p>

<p>'You kiss your mother with that mouth?'</p>

<p>Melanie took a deep breath and smiled, full
 wattage. 'I tell you what, let's go back outside, let my
 cameraman through and we'll do this properly.'</p>

<p>She walked up to the door but Delaney made no
 motion to move out of her way.</p>

<p>'You mentioned the buckle.'</p>

<p>'So?'</p>

<p>'So how did you know about it?'</p>

<p>'If you don't let me out of this room right now
 you'll have bigger problems to worry about than
 that.'</p>

<p>Delaney gripped her upper arm. She kept herself in
 very good condition, that much was clear, but she
 gasped as he tightened his grip. 'No details have been
 released about the belt buckle. Why don't you tell me
 how you know about it?'</p>

<p>Melanie met his gaze, unfazed. It was a long time
 since any man had scared her. 'How about you take
 your hand off the merchandise?'</p>

<p>Delaney released his grip. 'Believe me, whatever
 you've got to peddle, I'm not in the market for,
 honey.'</p>

<p>'I got a call. The belt buckle. He told me to ask you
 what belt buckles were for. He said it was a clue.
 Seems he was right.'</p>

<p>'Who was it?'</p>

<p>Melanie smiled. 'Back in the market, are we?</p>

<p>'Just answer the fucking question.'</p>

<p>'I don't know. Male voice, could be twenties, could
 be thirties.'</p>

<p>'You didn't get his number?'</p>

<p>Melanie shook her head. 'It was withheld. He said
 he was the artist responsible for this morning's
 installation piece on Hampstead Heath.'</p>

<p>'What else did he say?'</p>

<p>'He said you were obviously no student of art
 history so he was going to have to give you some
 more clues.'</p>

<p>'He actually mentioned me by name?'</p>

<p>'Yes.'</p>

<p>And that was it?'</p>

<p>'Just that and the belt buckle. He said he'd be in
 touch with me again.' Melanie rubbed her upper arm.
 'This how you treat everyone who has information
 for you?'</p>

<p>'You came in here pointing a camera and looking
 for a story. Not exactly trying to be a model citizen.'
 Delaney moved away from the door but Melanie
 Jones did not try to leave.</p>

<p>'You have your job to do, Jack. I've got mine.
 You're smart?' She made it a question. 'You'll see
 how we can help each other here.'</p>

<p>Delaney shook his head. 'Like you helped
 Alexander Walker last month?'</p>

<p>Melanie tilted her head slightly, looking up at him.
 'Is that what the attitude is all about?'</p>

<p>'He was a poster boy for the worst kind of
 corruption in the police and you wanted to make him
 a media celebrity.'</p>

<p>'We're both on the same side here, Detective
 Inspector. You got any children?'</p>

<p>'What's that got to do with anything?'</p>

<p>'Financial security, Jack . . .'</p>

<p>'Don't call me that.'</p>

<p>'For life. For you, for your family, for your
 children. The inside story on how you brought down
 Alexander Walker. And how you worked with me to
 bring down a serial killer.'</p>

<p>'He's not a serial killer. And I work with you the
 day Johnny Cash starts his comeback tour.'</p>

<p>Melanie Jones shook her head, deadly serious now.
 'We have to work together, whether you like it or
 not, Detective Inspector. He's contacting me and this
 guy is a serial killer. You know it, I know it and,
 more importantly, he knows it.'</p>

<p>Delaney would have responded but the door burst
 open and Superintendent George Napier barrelled
 past him into the room. He smiled apologetically at
 the reporter.</p>

<p>'I am really sorry about this, Miss Jones.'</p>

<p>Delaney glared at him. 'With respect, sir. I am
 conducting an interview here.'</p>

<p>'No you're not, Delaney. Your interview is over.'</p>

<p>Melanie Jones brought the full force of her
 professional smile to bear. 'It's quite all right, Superintendent.
 The detective inspector and I were
 discussing the case.'</p>

<p>'It's not all right, Miss Jones. I will not have members
 of the press treated in such a cavalier fashion in
 my station. Your cameraman has told me how you
 were manhandled, Miss Jones.'</p>

<p>'A small misunderstanding.'</p>

<p>Delaney held his boss's gaze. 'No misunderstanding
 on my part, sir. I don't care if she's press,
 public or a member of the royal frigging family, she
 has information on an ongoing murder case then she
 gets treated just the same by me.'</p>

<p>Napier goggled at him. 'Have you listened to a
 word I have said, Inspector?'</p>

<p>Delaney smiled sardonically at Melanie Jones. 'I'm
 just doing my job, sir.'</p>

<p>'Wait outside, Delaney. I'll speak to you later.'</p>

<p>Delaney nodded pointedly at the reporter then
 walked out, closing the door loudly behind him, and
 took a moment to compose himself. He'd have liked
 to have gone back inside and slapped his boss but he
 knew what the consequences would be, and although
 in times recently past he wouldn't have much cared,
 right now he needed his badge and the authority it
 brought. He still had personal matters to take care of
 and his warrant card was going to help do just that.</p>

<p>He walked through to public reception area where
 the long-haired cameraman was watching him with a
 smug and amused expression on his face as he
 lounged against the counter. 'Your boss had a word
 with you, did he?'</p>

<p>Delaney walked up to him, the smile on his lips far
 from friendly. He grasped the camera out of his
 hands, slid the broadcast-quality Betacam tape out of
 it and put it in his jacket pocket.</p>

<p>The cameraman was outraged. 'You can't do that!'</p>

<p>Delaney ignored him and nodded at Dave. 'Napier
 will probably be looking for me in a minute.'</p>

<p>'Want me to tell him where you'll be?'</p>

<p>'Tell him I got called away. Urgent business.'</p>

<p>Dave smiled knowingly. 'Have one on me.'</p>

<p>Delaney cocked his finger at him, pulled an
 imaginary trigger and headed towards the entrance.</p>

<p>The cameraman called after him. 'Oi!'</p>

<p>Delaney ignored him, walking outside and closing
 the door behind him, silencing the cameraman's outraged
 protests.</p>

<p>He looked up at the sky and thought about what
 Melanie Jones had told him. The moon was low in
 the sky, leaking a sulphurous light over the dark car
 park; a few clouds scudded over it as he watched,
 throwing a shadow over his face, but his eyes still
 glittered.</p>

<p>Derek Watters had been a prison officer for twenty-two
 years and married for twenty-three. He had left
 school at the age of sixteen and worked in a number
 of different jobs over the next year or so, never really
 settling into any of them. But after walking into a
 recruiting office, he had decided that when he turned
 eighteen he was going to join the army. His mates
 threw him a big party at the local pub, the Roebuck,
 to celebrate his eighteenth and give him a bit of a
 send-off before he took the Queen's shilling. Derek's
 mates had all had a whip-round and organised for a
 strippergram as well. A girl whose real name was
 Audrey but was calling herself for the purposes of
 erotic entertainment Sergeant Sally Strict. She was
 nineteen, dressed in a policewoman's outfit and had
 breasts like coconuts, the young Derek Watters had
 thought. Heavy, full, magnificent. Exotic fruit
 indeed.</p>

<p>Derek had always been more of a headlamps than
 a bumper man, still was. And Audrey's headlamps on
 that night dazzled him. Literally. She'd made him
 walk around the pub on all fours barking like a dog
 and then given him eighteen lashes with a soft suede
 whip. One for each of his years. Then given him his
 birthday treat. She hadn't done a full strip, she was
 just a fun telegram girl she'd said. But she had gone
 topless and let him cradle his face in her ample
 bosom. It was the best night of Derek's life thus far.</p>

<p>It turned out that Audrey was a student, training as
 a nursery nurse. The strippergram work was just to
 help pay for her fees. Derek had taken her card and a
 couple of days later he'd finally sobered up and found
 the courage to call her up and ask her out on a date.
 To his delight she had said yes. And on the third date
 she'd taken him home to her digs at college. Donned
 the policewoman's uniform once again and then took
 it off for an audience of just one. Took it off very
 slowly. All of it this time. And if Derek had been
 happy before he was fit to burst now.</p>

<p>But that 'now' was twenty-three years ago, he
 thought bitterly as he trudged up past the hordes of
 office workers who were spilling down the short
 steps into Piccadilly Circus station. Twenty-three
 years ago; and three weeks after her strictly non-
 Metropolitan Police regulation knickers had hit the
 floor of her eight foot by eight foot bedroom, he had
 got the phone call. He was having Sunday dinner at
 his parents' at the time, roast pork and parsnips,
 thinking life didn't get much better. No, it got worse.</p>

<p>Audrey was up the stick, he was the father, and his
 plans for joining the army were right in the shitter.</p>

<p>She wouldn't hear of him joining up. She wanted
 him home with her, not swanning off overseas whenever
 Maggie wanted to win another election. She
 wanted them to get married as soon as possible, and
 it wasn't just one baby she wanted, it was three. And
 there was no way she was walking up the aisle
 looking like Alison Moyet with a pillow stuffed
 under her jumper. Derek wasn't even thinking about
 marriage let alone a family but abortion was out of
 the question, seemingly. Audrey had her way; they
 got married and had three kids. Derek's application
 to join the police force was turned down and he
 ended up in the prison services. And the worst of it
 was, she refused to wear the uniform ever again.
 After her third baby her stomach had thickened and
 her back broadened and her once coconut-like
 breasts were now like flabby pumpkins that were
 long past their Halloween best.</p>

<p>So, he was going to put the touch on the copper
 and his CID mate. The information he had should be
 worth a couple of C notes and he was going to put
 the money to good use. A feisty little Irish tart he
 liked to visit when he had enough folding squirrelled
 away.</p>

<p>He smiled to himself as he pulled out his mobile
 phone and stood outside Boots on the north side of
 Piccadilly Circus, turning the collar of his raincoat
 up as the wind had freshened. There was moisture
 in the chill air. An hour ought to do it, he figured.
 Give him time to get some cash from DI Jimmy
 Skinner, a couple of drinks to set the ball rolling and
 then round to the auburn-haired strumpet for
 another round of Sergeant Strict and the love
 truncheon. He punched in the number and grinned
 expectantly.</p>

<p>*</p>

<p>Delaney took a sip of his Guinness and wended his
 way through the crowd at the Pig and Whistle over to
 a back table where Sally Cartwright and a bunch of
 other people were sitting, He nodded to some of
 them, all uniform, all fresh-faced and eager. Cops
 really were getting younger these days, he thought.</p>

<p>'Glad you could make it, sir.' Sally pulled out a
 chair for him. 'I think you know most people.'</p>

<p>'Sure.'</p>

<p>Delaney nodded generally and shifted uncomfortably
 in his seat, the pain in his shoulder throbbing
 and reminding him that his own youth was far
 behind him. He took another pull of his Guinness.
 Creamy analgesic by the pint glass.</p>

<p>Sally gestured at the young, black constable. 'This
 is Danny Vine.'</p>

<p>'Nice to meet you again, sir.'</p>

<p>Delaney flashed him a quick smile as he shook his
 hand, pain lancing into his shoulder and making him
 regret it. 'Please don't call me sir. Not in here,
 anyway.'</p>

<p>'Sure.'</p>

<p>'And this is Michael Hill.'</p>

<p>She smiled at the blond-haired man in his mid-twenties.
 Delaney picked up the slight catch in her
 voice and the sparkle in her eye. Danny Vine had
 competition. He nodded at the man, not risking
 another handshake. He recognised him from somewhere,
 but couldn't quite place him. 'I know you?'</p>

<p>'You'd have seen me earlier, sir.'</p>

<p>'Like I said, no sirs. When you're out of uniform
 I'm just plain old Jack Delaney.'</p>

<p>'I'm not uniform.'</p>

<p>'Oh?'</p>

<p>'I'm the police photographer.'</p>

<p>Delaney nodded a little guiltily. 'Sure, I thought I
 recognised you.' The truth was he hardly noticed any
 of the myriad support staff when he was working.
 Especially if they were all kitted out in white
 spacesuits. Some detective.</p>

<p>'Any developments on the case, Inspector?' Danny
 Vine asked. He was clearly eager to show he was
 keen. Sally had better look out, Delaney reckoned.
 Youth and energy were dangerous enough, particularly
 when you added testosterone to the mix.</p>

<p>'Nothing new. We'll track down who she is
 tomorrow with any luck. Give us somewhere to start.'</p>

<p>'How are you going to do that?'</p>

<p>Michael Hill this time. Delaney sensed that they
 weren't really interested in talking to him per se, but
 thought that if they got on his good side they'd get on
 the good side of Sally Cartwright.</p>

<p>He was relieved to see Bob Wilkinson coming in
 and heading up to the bar. He smiled apologetically
 at Sally. 'Sorry, got to have a word with Bob.'</p>

<p>Sally nodded back distractedly but Delaney could
 tell she had other matters on her mind. Young love,
 he thought as he worked his way back through the
 noisy hubbub, God and all his angels save us from it.</p>

<p>'Inspector.'</p>

<p>'Get us a pint, Bob, for Christ's sake.'</p>

<p>Bob smiled at the barmaid and jerked his thumb at
 Delaney. The barmaid, a button-nosed temptress
 called Angela something, Delaney never could
 remember, grinned at him as she poured a fresh pint
 of Guinness. 'Shot with that, Jack?'</p>

<p>'No. Being a good boy tonight.'</p>

<p>Angela laughed, a throaty, husky laugh that started
 somewhere low. 'Can't see that somehow.'</p>

<p>Delaney winked at her. 'Turning over a new leaf.
 Jack Delaney. Modern man.'</p>

<p>'Yeah, you and Hugh Hefner.' She put the pint on
 the counter. 'Let it settle and if you want a top-up
 give me a whistle.' She moved off to serve some
 others at the end of the bar. Her hips swinging like a
 Tennessee two-step.</p>

<p>Bob looked at Delaney watching her. 'They reckon
 if a woman swings her hips like that, she isn't
 ovulating.'</p>

<p>Delaney looked back at him. 'That a fact?'</p>

<p>'Mine of them, me. Fuck police work, I should
 have been a black-cab driver.'</p>

<p>Delaney couldn't be bothered to wait for the
 Guinness to settle properly and took a long gulp.
 'Got a stupid question for you, Bob?'</p>

<p>'Shoot?'</p>

<p>'What's a belt buckle used for?'</p>

<p>Bob Wilkinson shrugged. 'Well, in the good old
 days it would be used to keep your women and
 children in line.' He grinned. 'Nowadays just to keep
 your dignity, and your trousers up.'</p>

<p>'Yeah.' Delaney nodded.</p>

<p>Bob frowned. 'Why do you ask that?'</p>

<p>Delaney shrugged and immediately regretted asking
 Bob the question. 'I have no idea.' He took another
 pull on his drink and as he put the pint down on the
 bar and gestured to Angela for a top-up, his mobile
 phone rang. Irritated, he pulled it out from his pocket
 but his expression changed as he saw who was calling.</p>

<p>'Delaney.'</p>

<p>'Jack, it's Kate.'</p>

<p>'I saw. What's up?'</p>

<p>'I need to talk to you.'</p>

<p>'What about?'</p>

<p>The large group at the bar started singing loudly.
 Kate said something on the other end of the line but
 Delaney couldn't catch it. 'Hang on, Kate, I'll take it
 outside.'</p>

<p>Angela watched him, puzzled, as he walked
 towards the exit. She picked up Delaney's unfinished
 pint. 'Does he want this or not?'</p>

<p>Bob grinned at her. 'I may be the fount of all
 wisdom, darling, but what I am not, is a psychic.'</p>

<p>'No, what you is, is an arsehole.'</p>

<p>Bob nodded with a self-satisfied grin and took a sip
 of his pint. Some things you couldn't argue with.</p>

<p>Jimmy Skinner liked coming to Soho for very
 different reasons to the prison officer from Bayfield
 Prison. Jimmy had two vices. One was Internet poker
 and the other was Scotch. Unlike Delaney, however,
 he didn't drink it like lemonade. He treated himself
 every now and again with a small glass when he had
 won a high stakes game. He never drank when he
 was playing. That way disaster lay. You played the
 odds, you trusted the maths. What you didn't do was
 get drunk and risk all on chance, on the vagaries of
 the turn of a card. Lady luck was for losers.</p>

<p>Soho had a couple of great places to shop for the
 whisky connoisseur. One was on Old Compton
 Street and the other was on Greek Street. Just down
 from a bookshop specialising in spanking magazines
 and one of the entrances to the Pillars of Hercules,
 which was why he was more than happy with where
 Derek Watters had suggested they meet.</p>

<p>He stepped out of the whisky shop, pleased with
 himself. In his carrier bag a bottle of Johnny Walker
 Blue Label. A blended whisky but at one hundred and
 sixty pounds it wasn't the kind of stuff you found on
 special offer in the alcohol aisle of Tesco's. It wasn't
 about the money for Jimmy Skinner, it was about the
 victory. And victory always deserved to be marked,
 in his opinion.</p>

<p>He looked up at the narrow, black clouds scudding
 across an already dark and crimson sky then
 suddenly down again as he heard the sound of an
 engine screaming in high revs and the concurrent
 sound of tyres screeching on tarmac. He looked up
 the street and the carrier bag in his right hand slid
 from his open fingers. The bottle inside it hit the
 pavement hard and smashed. But Jimmy Skinner
 didn't register it all. He was too busy shouting,
 straining his lungs in the face of the gusting wind.</p>

<p>'Look out!'</p>

<p>But for Derek Watters as he spun round to the
 sound of the tortured engine, it was too late. Far too
 late.</p>

<p>The jet-black Land Rover Discovery hit into him
 still accelerating. The bull bar on the front of it
 crushed his ribs, splintering them and piercing his
 heart before the front of his head smashed down onto
 the bonnet. He was thrown back into the street as the
 driver stamped on the brakes and then into reverse,
 the tyres biting and screaming once more. As Jimmy
 Skinner ran across the road the back of Derek
 Watters head slapped hard down on the road with
 the crunching sound of a coconut being cracked by a
 hammer.</p>

<p>The Land Rover roared backwards into Soho
 Square, then drove round the green and, accelerating
 once more, shot up Soho Street and out into the busy
 traffic of Oxford Street, oblivious to the blaring of
 horns and sudden screeching of brakes, and disappeared
 as it turned left heading towards Marble
 Arch. Skinner watched it go, trying to see the number
 plate, but it had been taped over. He knelt down and
 put his fingers to Derek Watters's carotid artery on
 the side of his neck, though it was a movement made
 more by instinct than expectation. But, surprisingly,
 the prison officer had one last breath in him. As his
 eyes clouded over he looked at the tall, thin, bone-faced
 policeman kneeling beside him and sighed more
 than spoke: 'Murder.'</p>

<p>Then his eyes froze, motionless, and Derek
 Watters, forty-one years old, who never got to serve
 his country by bearing arms, died on a chill, wet
 street in a city that had a heart as cold as a solar
 system where the sun had died out many millennia
 ago.</p>

<p>Delaney sat behind the wheel of his car taking a
 moment to collect his thoughts. Adjusting the rearview
 mirror he looked at himself. He didn't know
 what had got Kate Walker so agitated, she wouldn't
 tell him on the telephone, just told him to meet her at
 the Holly Bush pub in Hampstead. He knew it well
 enough, it was just up the road from his new house.
 What he didn't know was what had got her so
 rattled; he could hear it in her voice, the thinnest
 form of politeness covering someone close to
 breaking point. It had something to do with what
 happened in the hospital car park that morning, he'd
 bet his life on it. Whatever it was that had gone
 down, the clear fact was that Kate needed his help.
 She didn't say it in so many words, but it was
 expressed in her barely restrained emotion. She
 needed his help. And that was the one thing Jack
 Delaney couldn't walk away from.</p>

<p>He'd put the mirror back in position, switched the
 engine on and slipped the gearstick into first, when
 his phone rang. He angrily slipped the gear back into
 neutral, glanced at the cover of his phone and
 snapped it open.</p>

<p>'Make it quick.'</p>

<p>'Jack. It's Jimmy Skinner.'</p>

<p>Kate Walker sat at the long wooden bar in the Holly
 Bush. Comforted on the one hand to be surrounded
 in the warmth and hubbub of familiar faces and
 voices of the early-evening crowd, and yet starting
 every time the front door opened. She wanted it to be
 Delaney coming through that door but was terrified
 of the notion that it would be Paul Archer walking in
 instead. She didn't know what made her suggest this
 pub to Delaney. She wasn't thinking straight. Hadn't
 been since she had woken up this morning to find
 that man in her bed. She took a sip at her Bloody
 Mary. Cautiously. She had no intentions of getting
 hammered again tonight; besides, she was pregnant.
 God knows what she was going to do about that.
 And maybe she hadn't been raped. Maybe she was
 blowing things all out of proportion. She certainly
 had drunk a lot last night, maybe they had gone back
 to her flat, got paralytic and just passed out in bed.
 But if that was the case, why couldn't she remember
 any of it?</p>

<p>She looked at her watch again. Where the bloody
 hell was Jack Delaney? It had taken all her nerve to
 call him in the first place and if he stood her up now,
 leaving her alone at the bar like a jilted teenager, she
 would kill him. She downed her Bloody Mary and
 gestured at the barman for another. After all, two
 wouldn't hurt. Would they?</p>

<p>The ambulance pulled away from the kerb and drove
 slowly down Greek Street towards Shaftesbury
 Avenue. It had no need for sirens and lights. The
 police cars that had cordoned off the area, blocking
 traffic from Soho Square, Bateman Street and
 Manette Street, pulled away too. Nothing to see here
 either. Not any more, at least. Delaney leaned back
 against the painted glass of the porno bookshop and
 put a cigarette in his mouth. He held the packet out
 to Skinner who shook his head then lit the cigarette
 with a lazy scrape of a match.</p>

<p>He inhaled deeply and looked up at the night sky.
 It was like a carmine canvas that an artist had
 dragged thick, soot-stained fingers across. Like the
 black fingers of blood that had crept along the
 cobbles where Derek Watters had been murdered. He
 exhaled a thin stream of smoke and looked back at
 his colleague.</p>

<p>'Definitely not an accident?'</p>

<p>Jimmy Skinner shook his head.</p>

<p>'Professional hit?'</p>

<p>'I'd say so. The guy didn't have a chance. Walking
 along the street when suddenly out of nowhere . . .
 Bang!' Skinner slapped one hand hard against the
 other.</p>

<p>Delaney took another thoughtful drag on his
 cigarette. 'And that was all he said. The one word.'</p>

<p>'Yeah. "Murder." Hardly the most insightful final
 utterance, seeing as I had just watched him being
 splattered halfway up Greek Street.'</p>

<p>'What's going on, Jimmy?'</p>

<p>Skinner shrugged drily. 'Looks like somebody
 doesn't want anyone talking to you.'</p>

<p>Delaney nodded in agreement. 'Looks like.'</p>

<p>'I'd watch your back, if I were you, Jack.
 Somebody going to all this trouble, easier maybe to
 just take you out.'</p>

<p>A cloud cleared the moon, throwing for a moment
 a spill of yellow light that reflected in the black orbs
 of Delaney's eye.</p>

<p>He threw his cigarette on to the road, the sparks
 flaring briefly then dying out as he crushed it under
 heel. 'Maybe.'</p>

<p>Kate sipped on her third or fourth drink. She wasn't
 drunk, just couldn't remember how many she had
 had. Time passes in a different way when you're lost
 in thought. No matter what Einstein said, some
 things aren't relative. She tasted the fluid in her
 mouth, thin and liquid and she realised that all she
 was drinking was melted ice, any vodka in the glass
 long since gone. She rattled the glass and held it out
 to the barman, who refilled it and added the drink to
 her tab. She swirled it in her hand, watching the
 splash of red wine, which the Holly Bush always
 added to a Bloody Mary, spin like a star system in a
 universe of its own. Like a black hole. Like the eye of
 Sauron.</p>

<p>Some time later she looked at the oak-framed
 mirror above the bar and could see the front door to
 the pub opening and a man with curly dark hair
 entering and her heart pounded suddenly in her chest
 and she struggled to breathe. She knew the symptoms.
 It was a panic attack. And being the doctor
 that she was, Kate knew that sometimes panic was
 absolutely the appropriate response.</p>

<p>A single, skeletal leaf was cartwheeling along the
 road. It was a dry, brittle, frail thing and it came to
 rest, finally, in the damp gutter that was already
 clogged with the decomposing corpses of leaves from
 the semi-denuded trees that lined the street. A street
 of wealthy people, whose lives behind the closed oak
 doors and wrought-iron gates were consumed with
 problems other than mortgages and council tax or
 the National Health Service. This was a street of
 financiers, of publishers, of authors and literary
 agents, of property developers and quantity surveyors,
 of Harley Street doctors and surgeons . . . and
 of a forensic pathologist who had, just that very day,
 sickened of death, and handed in her notice. The man
 in a car across the road from her house didn't know
 that, however, and it wouldn't have made any
 difference if he had. Her job, after all, had brought
 her to his attention in the first place.</p>

<p>He looked down at the pointed toe of his cowboy
 boot as it rested on the accelerator pedal and was
 glad he had gone for the snakeskin rather than the
 leather option. He could relate to snakes. The ability
 to move silently and unseen. The ability to shed one's
 skin. The ability to bare one's teeth and terrify. He
 smiled to himself humourlessly, and the light from
 the watching moon lent his teeth a cast the colour of
 old ivory. He looked across once more at the empty
 house and waited.</p>

<p>Hunters knew how to wait after all.</p>

<p>Jennifer Cole looked at the images on her Macbook
 laptop with professional detachment. A woman in a
 corset wearing old-fashioned seamed stockings and
 posing like a Vargas pin-up come to life. She was a
 full breasted woman in her late twenties, her bee-stung
 lips painted red with a hint of purple, the tip of
 her tongue visible and wet with promise, the pupils in
 her dark painted eyes wide with desire. She wasn't
 making love to the camera, she was fucking it.
 Jennifer flicked through the next pictures, some in
 uniform, some topless, some in elegant lingerie from
 Agent Provocateur. The burlesque look was very
 popular at the moment. A hint of goth, a hint of forbidden
 pleasure. Pain and pleasure, sugar and spice.
 She spent a lot of money on her lingerie and the
 photos that she used to update her webpage at least
 once a month. She probably didn't have to do it so
 often, but the truth was she enjoyed the ritual of it.
 The costumery and the perfumes, the candlelight and
 the moonlight. The black and red satin sheets. The
 artistry.</p>

<p>It had been a long time since Jennifer Cole had
 needed the money she made from her services. She
 had got into it, as most did, from need. But that
 need had passed. She was selective now too. She
 didn't work every night and was extremely choosy
 about her clients. After all, that was the main thrill
 for her, the power she felt. She didn't feel degraded
 or used, just the opposite. It was her decision, her
 choice to make. And it was never something she
 regretted. She knew about the human body, how it
 functioned, how it was put together, what parts
 needed maintenance. Sex was just part of that. And
 it was fun.</p>

<p>She flicked forward to the last of the images. She
 was wearing a long fur coat that she had bought on
 a cruise trip to the Norwegian fjords one year. The
 real thing, never mind the paint-throwing hypocrites
 with their leather belts and shoes. It was mink, thick
 and luxurious. Her hair was piled high on her head
 with silver threads adorning and confining it. She
 wore silver boots with high platform soles and heels.
 The coat was open, her breasts jutting with the pride
 of the goddess Diana, her sex cupped in the
 sculptured, rounded vee of a silk thong, and in her
 right hand a long, silver-handled riding crop.</p>

<p>Her small silver mobile phone rang and she
 answered it slowly, patting her hair as she looked at
 herself in the mirror. Her pupils widened as she
 licked her lips and purred.</p>

<p>'Hello. How may I help you?'</p>

<p>If she'd been a cream cake, she would have eaten
 herself.</p>

<p>'Angelina. It's me.'</p>

<p>Angelina, her stage name as she liked to think of
 it, had been taken from an early American feminist
 hero of hers, Angelina Grimké, and not, as some
 had assumed, after the famous actress. She looked at
 the photo of herself holding a crop and thought it
 must have been an omen of sorts that he should
 have called just then. 'Hello, bad boy. How have
 you been?'</p>

<p>There was a pause, then his voice, husky with
 desire. 'I don't think Santa is going to have me on his
 nice list this Christmas.'</p>

<p>'You've been naughty?'</p>

<p>The voice on the other end was breathy. 'Ooh,
 yeah.'</p>

<p>She could hear the need. 'I hope you're not being
 naughty right now?'</p>

<p>'Not just yet.'</p>

<p>'You want to come and confess to a superior
 mother?'</p>

<p>'Not today.'</p>

<p>'Oh?'</p>

<p>'I want you to come to me.'</p>

<p>'It's going to cost more.'</p>

<p>'I don't mind paying. Bad men pay for their sins,
 don't they? Sooner or later we all pay.'</p>

<p>'If they know what's good for them.'</p>

<p>'I know what's good for me.'</p>

<p>Jennifer Cole had only met the man recently. He
 had visited her a couple of times at her flat in Chalk
 Farm but she recognised the soft burr in his voice and
 knew one thing for sure: he was good-looking with
 kinky tastes. Just her kind of man. She didn't do this
 to pay the rent, after all.</p>

<p>'Where do you want to meet?'</p>

<p>'I thought we could go for a drink first.'</p>

<p>'It's your dollar, babe. You spend it how you
 want.'</p>

<p>'That's what I want.'</p>

<p>'Where?'</p>

<p>'Camden?'</p>

<p>'Sure. Tell me when and where.' She listened then
 hung up the phone and looked at her picture on her
 laptop again. Only the hair colour was wrong. Her
 midnight cowboy liked brunettes. She picked a wig
 off a stand and slipped it over her head. She stood up
 and picked up the long riding crop from one of her
 bedside cabinets and gave it a swishing flex in the air.
 She slammed the crop down hard on the bed with a
 satisfying thud and smiled. Christmas was coming
 early to Camden.</p>

<p>Hampstead was huddled against the weather. The
 scudding clouds had taken on weight and mass now,
 and although the wind still blew at a constant rate
 the swollen sky above was black and unbroken. The
 air was cold and threaded with moisture. Delaney
 looked up at the night sky, the moon now hidden
 behind the low wall of cloud that hung over the
 spread city like a biblical judgement. It shouldn't be
 so dark this early at this time of year, he thought as
 he looked at the entrance to the pub, deliberated for
 a second or two and then tapped a cigarette from a
 crumpled packet into his hand and searched through
 his pockets for his matches. The scent of the perfume
 Opium suddenly filled his nostrils and he realised a
 woman had come up to stand beside him. She was in
 her late twenties in a fake-fur coat and was holding a
 lighter out to him. Delaney was taken aback for a
 moment then leaned forward so she could light his
 cigarette.</p>

<p>'Thanks.'</p>

<p>'Not a problem.'</p>

<p>Her voice had the lyrical smoothness of the
 confident rich, one whose education had eschewed
 affectation.</p>

<p>Just like Kate's.</p>

<p>The woman closed her lighter and Delaney
 wondered why someone such as her would approach
 him, but then realised as the woman walked away
 and joined her friends that the gesture was just one of
 solidarity, of friendship. The fraternity of smokers in
 exile, gathered in groups outside every pub and bar
 throughout the country, united by the stigma of
 nicotine.</p>

<p>The woman's friends laughed a little and
 whispered something to her. She turned to look back
 at him curiously and Delaney realised he had been
 staring. He looked away and sipped some smoke
 from his cigarette into his mouth, then drew it deep
 so that it burned his lungs. Delaney was sure he saw
 something akin to pity in the young woman's eyes
 and the thought of it stung more than the hot smoke.
 What the hell was he thinking of, buying a house in
 an area like this? He looked at the window of the pub
 behind him, bright with colour and noise, he looked
 through it at the shining faces with smiles full of
 porcelain, and voices ringing with the confidence of a
 golden future. He looked at the fashionable ties and
 slicked-back hair, at the Barbour jackets and
 coloured, corduroy trousers, and he thought of the
 dark-haired woman who waited for him at the bar
 and who fitted in among that crowd like a Hunter
 Wellington at the Chelsea Flower Show. He told
 himself he hadn't moved to be near her. It was to be
 near his daughter and his sister-in-law and her
 family. But as he ground out his cigarette on the cold
 slate beneath his feet, he realised the biggest sin was
 lying to yourself. The trouble was that, contrary to
 received opinion, the truth did not set you free.
 Sometimes the truth was an iron cage of your own
 fashioning.</p>

<p>He walked through the door, the sounds and
 chatter around him muted somehow, the light a softness
 like warmth as he threaded through the crowd
 and saw her waiting for him at the bar.</p>

<p>'Hello, Jack.'</p>

<p>He could see in her eyes that the drink she held in
 her hand was not her first. But her gaze was steady
 and the warmth of her breath was sweet. Her lips had
 been stained by the tomato juice and Delaney wanted
 nothing more than to put his arm around her
 alabaster shoulder and kiss her.</p>

<p>Instead he pulled over a stool, sat beside her and
 gestured to the barman. 'Another one here please,
 and I'll have a large . . .' He hesitated for a moment.
 'I'll have a large Bushmills. Straight up. No ice, no
 spittle.'</p>

<p>Kate handed her drink over to the barman. 'Vodka
 tonic please.' She smiled at Delaney. 'You can only
 drink so much tomato juice.'</p>

<p>'Of course.'</p>

<p>Delaney waited for her to say more but Kate
 turned her attentions back to the barman and handed
 Delaney his drink when it arrived. He took a sip of
 his whiskey and before he could ask her why she had
 wanted to see him, Kate spoke.</p>

<p>'I'm pregnant, Jack.'</p>

<p>And for the second or third time in his life the
 world rocked on its axis. Kate was saying something
 else but Delaney couldn't hear it. All he could hear
 was the blood pounding in his temples. He took
 another sip of his drink and tried to catch her words
 but failed. 'I'm sorry?' he managed at last.</p>

<p>'It's not a question of anybody being to blame,
 Jack.'</p>

<p>'No, that's not what I meant. I meant I didn't hear
 the rest of it.'</p>

<p>'I don't know what the rest of it is, Jack. That's
 what I'm saying. I don't know what to think, I just
 wanted you to know, that's all. And I didn't want to
 tell you on the telephone.'</p>

<p>Delaney nodded, still taking it in. 'I'm the father?'</p>

<p>Kate looked at him, trying to read his eyes, cursing
 herself for drinking too much again and clouding her
 judgement. 'Yes, Jack. You're the father.'</p>

<p>'I see.'</p>

<p>Kate took another swallow of her drink. 'Is that
 it?'</p>

<p>'I don't know, Kate.' He shrugged. 'What was that
 business this morning, in the hospital car park?'</p>

<p>Kate shook her head, the colour drained out of her
 face and Delaney couldn't work out if it was through
 fear or through anger. 'This has got nothing to do
 with him.'</p>

<p>'If he's hurt you in some way, I want to help.'</p>

<p>Kate had to fight back the tears but she was
 damned if she was going to let him see her cry.
 'You're a knight in shining armour, are you, Jack?'</p>

<p>'Hardly, but I could see something was wrong. I
 can be a friend, can't I?'</p>

<p>Kate pushed her glass away and stood up a little
 unsteadily. 'You know what, this was a bad idea. We
 have to talk, but not now.'</p>

<p>She picked her coat up off the back of her chair
 and would have walked away but Jack held her arm,
 gently, as he stood up himself. He looked into her
 eyes and could see the need in them as naked as a
 flame. He wanted to wrap her in his arms and hold
 her and tell her that he was there for her in every way
 that she wanted. But the visions of the dead man in
 Greek Street and the comatose body of Kevin Norrell
 held him back. The violence visited upon his wife
 four years ago was still a force loose in his world, a
 force that he could neither identify nor control. So in
 that moment, between breathing and speaking, as he
 looked into Kate Walker's eyes, he knew that the past
 still had a grip on him as tight as the clasp of a
 drowning man. He could not offer Kate the emotional
 lifeline she so clearly needed. 'Let me know
 what you decide.'</p>

<p>Kate looked at him, the hurt sparking in her eyes.
 He wished he could kiss it away, but he knew, also,
 that the kind of pain she was feeling took a lifetime
 of disappointment to build, and its healing was way
 beyond the small amelioration provided by such
 short-lived gestures.</p>

<p>'Fuck you, Jack.' She brushed his arm aside and
 walked quickly to the door. Delaney let her go.
 Turning back to the bar again and looking at his
 reflection in the mirror hanging on the wall behind
 the counter, he felt his face burning with shame.</p>

<p>Outside, Kate made no effort to hold back the tears
 that were now streaming down her face. What had
 she expected of the man after all? She'd had no
 illusions, no dreams that the fact of her pregnancy
 would drive him begging for forgiveness into his
 arms. What had she expected of him then? The truth
 was that she didn't know, but the cold reality of the
 encounter was too much for her to bear. He wanted
 to be friends, he wanted her to let him know what she
 decides! Christ, if she had had a shotgun in her hands
 right then she would have cut him in half with it. She
 dashed the back of her right hand across her eyes.
 What the hell had she been thinking? She should have
 known Delaney would be as emotionally available as
 a piece of the frozen Donegal turf or wherever it was
 he came from. But the trouble was she knew exactly
 what she was thinking, even if she hadn't been honest
 with herself. She wanted to tell him all about Paul
 Archer, about what she thought he had done to her.
 She wanted to tell him everything and she wanted
 him to take care of it for her. She wanted him to fold
 her in his arms and tell her that he loved her. How
 stupid was that? She wiped her hand across her eyes
 and crossed the road, barely registering the horn
 blaring from a passing car that had to swerve to miss
 her. She hated herself for being so weak and formed
 a fist of her right hand. If she had to do it all on her
 own then that was how it was going to be. Damn
 Delaney. Damn all men, if it came to that. Kate
 Walker had been her own woman for thirty-odd
 years and she wasn't about to let that change now.
 She took a deep breath and wiped her eyes dry. She
 knew what she was going to do.</p>

<p>Delaney finished a second whiskey in five minutes.
 He looked at his watch. He should never have let
 Kate go off on her own like that, she deserved to
 know what was going on. He had no intention of
 letting the matter of Kevin Norrell drop. Norrell had
 something to tell him that would lead him to his
 wife's killers. Derek Watters's murder proved that
 much. He had never bought the idea that the attack
 on Kevin Norrell was just some sort of rough justice
 in prison. Kevin Norrell was an ignorant, ill-bred,
 psychopathic Neanderthal with as much conscience
 as a rabid stoat, but he wasn't a nonce. Delaney was
 pretty sure about that. So that meant the attack on
 Norrell and Watters's murder was to stop them both
 from getting information to him. He should have told
 Kate that. She would have understood. But her
 revelation that she was pregnant had taken him
 completely by surprise. He needed to talk to her. He
 finished his glass and considered for a moment as the
 barman gestured to see if he wanted another. He
 shook his head and headed for the door.</p>

<p>It took Delaney a matter of minutes to reach Kate's
 house. He crossed the road and looked up at the
 windows. There were no lights on. It had been ten
 minutes since she had stormed out of the pub. She
 should definitely be home by now. He hated to think
 of her in there alone with the lights out, curled up on
 her sofa sobbing. He walked up to the door and rang
 the bell. After a short while he rang it again, but there
 was no answer. He banged his fist on the door a few
 times and called her name out but still there was no
 answer.</p>

<p>'Come on, Kate. If you're in there open the door.
 We need to talk. Jeez, I know I've been a prick, just
 let me talk to you.'</p>

<p>Apart from a curtain twitching in her neighbour's
 property there was no response. He glanced at his
 watch and then looked up the road. There was no
 sign of her. He took out his mobile and quickly
 tapped in her name. After a few rings her voice on an
 answerphone cut in asking him to leave a message.
 He hesitated and then closed the phone. He hated
 leaving messages and what could he say anyway? He
 looked up once more at the dark windows. If Kate
 was at home she clearly wasn't ready to talk to him
 just yet. He pulled his overcoat closed and set off
 back down the road. He was tempted to keep going
 as he neared his new house, keep going further down
 the hill and then turn right into the Richard Steele
 pub. Take the prescription in iron-rich Guinness and
 amber measure, repeat as necessary, but for the first
 time in a very long while he realised he didn't want to
 be alcohol-numbed; he knew he was going to need a
 clear head about him.</p>

<p>He took his key out of his pocket, opened his front
 door, and went inside.</p>

<p>The scream was cut off very quickly. His hand was
 around her throat like the strike of a snake. Silencing
 her to a barely audible gurgle of horrified panic. The
 sound a kitten might make if you held it under
 muddy bathwater. Her legs kicked weakly and she
 felt a sharp pain in her neck. She gasped, fighting for
 breath, and reached out her right hand, snaggling her
 fingers in his thick curly hair, but before she could
 clench her hand and pull, the power seemed to drain
 from her muscles. Her body flopped like a marionette
 with its strings cut. He moved forward catching the
 droop of her body on his chest. She could feel the
 hardness of his prick as he pressed excitedly against
 her. Then the lights seemed to dim, she fought to
 blink her eyes open but, like her leg muscles, they
 refused to respond. She looked down, drool from her
 mouth falling to drop on the toe of his snakeskin
 cowboy boots. She felt a warmth rise from her lower
 body as though she were being lowered slowly into a
 very warm bath and then she was aware of nothing
 at all.</p>

<p>Paul Archer paused for breath, the sweat running
 down his forehead into his eyes and forcing him to
 blink. His breathing was ragged, gasping as much for
 oxygen as with desire. The woman on all fours
 beneath him was breathing hard too, whimpering,
 although he could make out no words, the gag he had
 tied made pretty sure of that. He placed his strong
 hands on either side of her perfectly shaped buttocks,
 raising them up to cup her waist and, positioning
 himself again, began to thrust deep into her, with the
 relentless and perfunctory rhythm of a gardener using
 a trowel to dig into hard earth. Stabbing at her. Her
 breathing was harder now, a yelping sound coming
 with every thrust, her luxuriant, dark hair flicking
 with the movement. Archer smiled coldly. Turn and
 turn about. He wasn't a misogynist, though he had
 been called one many times. He didn't despise
 women, he loved them, in fact, especially those that
 knew their place. And if they didn't, well, he enjoyed
 teaching them it.</p>

<p>A trickle of sweat ran down his nose and he
 released one hand to wipe it, wincing as a fresh stab
 of pain came with the movement. He gripped the
 woman's body again, not caring if he hurt her as he
 dug his fingers in and pulled her towards him. He
 had paid for his pleasures after all, hadn't he? Paid in
 so many ways.</p>

<empty-line /><empty-line /><p><strong>DAY TWO</strong></p>

<p>DC Sally Cartwright shivered and flapped her arms,
 trying to spread some warmth into them. Seven thirty
 in the morning now and she had been freezing her tits
 off on the heath since six o'clock. An old-fashioned
 bicycle, complete with front basket, was propped up
 against a tree with a puncture repair kit open on the
 ground beside it. A couple of concerned citizens, male
 naturally, had already offered to help her fix her tyre.
 She had moved them along. Their motives were not
 entirely based on the Good Samaritan principle, she
 guessed, but she also knew that neither of them
 matched the photofit of the flasher that they had been
 given by Valerie Manners, and neither looked the
 type, to be fair. Even so, she was learning that in
 matters of sexual deviancy you shouldn't judge a
 book by its cover. The most mild-seeming and
 normal of men were often capable of appalling
 crimes. You only had to look at Ted Bundy to see
 that. She slapped her arms again, unhappy to be
 made to wear a nurse's uniform, but Delaney, in a
 particularly filthy mood this morning, had insisted,
 arguing that the uniform itself might be the trigger.
 Maybe only nurses provided him with the desire to
 wag his wienie? Who knew, but she wasn't going to
 argue with her boss. Not with him in that mood, and
 what he was saying might well be the case. But if
 Delaney was right why hadn't the flasher been
 reported before? Why hadn't other nurses come
 forward? Either way she still felt a little foolish in the
 outfit, and was all too aware of her colleagues hidden
 away in the bushes and trees, looking at her. The
 honey trap. The wriggly worm on the hook. The bait
 in black suspenders. Although she had drawn the line
 when her colleagues had suggested that suspenders
 were an essential part of the nurse's uniform. Male
 colleagues, again, of course. But she knew better, and
 there was absolutely no way she was going to be
 wearing anything other than a very thick pair of
 tights and industrial-strength knickers under her skirt
 at that time of the morning on a cold, wet and windy
 South Hampstead Heath.</p>

<p>She flapped her arms again, feeling particularly
 conscious that Danny Vine was over there in the trees
 somewhere. Hidden, with the others, out of her range
 of sight, but with a good view of her. She smiled a
 little to herself as she thought of him. She'd had a
 good time the night before, being the centre of attention
 between him and Michael Hill, and she wasn't
 above playing the two off against each other. She was
 young after all, she was entitled to a bit of fun, she
 worked hard enough, God knows, to be allowed to let
 her hair down now and again, and misbehave a little.
 Not that playing men against each other was misbehaving,
 it was redressing the balance, if you asked
 her. And anyway, she wasn't sure which of them she
 preferred. Danny Vine was confident, fit, attractive,
 but he knew it. She could tell he was used to women
 eating out of the palm of his hand, but she knew how
 to deal with his type. Michael Hill, on the other hand,
 was quieter, but that meant he listened, he took
 interest and really paid attention. And while she didn't
 normally go for the blond-haired, blue-eyed Nordic
 type, she couldn't deny she was attracted to him. She
 was attracted to them both, in fact, so didn't feel any
 great rush to choose between them. She had gone off
 for a pizza with Danny after the pub last night but
 had agreed to go out with Michael tomorrow night
 for a drink and a curry. She smiled a little to herself
 again, lost in her thoughts, and then started as
 someone rustled through the leaves right behind her.
 She spun round to see a middle-aged, bald man
 staring at her. He was wearing a bright yellow duffel
 coat with a Burberry scarf wrapped round his neck.</p>

<p>'Can I help you at all?' he asked.</p>

<p>Sally shook her head. If this was the curly-haired
 man in his twenties or thirties who had flashed
 Valerie Manners yesterday morning, then he'd had a
 really, really bad night. She shook her head. 'No,
 that's okay, thanks, I've got it covered.' Unconsciously
 she pulled the cloak she had been given a
 little tighter around her shoulders.</p>

<p>The man made no move to go. 'I'm very good with
 punctures. I've got a bike myself. Well, several
 actually.' He shrugged and smiled. 'You know how
 it is.'</p>

<p>Sally had absolutely no idea. 'I'll be fine, thanks.'</p>

<p>'You work at the South Hampstead?'</p>

<p>'I'm sorry?'</p>

<p>The man gestured. 'Your uniform.'</p>

<p>Sally sighed, this man obviously wasn't going to go
 away. She reached into her pocket and pulled out her
 warrant card and held it out for him to see. 'No, I
 work at White City police station. I'm a detective
 constable. And I'm working here.' She didn't hide the
 impatience in her voice</p>

<p>The man didn't seem fazed, however, he just
 smiled good-naturedly. 'Oh, I see. Well, I'll let you
 get on. My name's James Collins. Mr Collins. I'm the
 obstetric surgical registrar at the hospital. Didn't like
 to think one of our own was stranded.'</p>

<p>Sally smiled back, embarrassed now. 'Oh, well,
 thanks again.' She nodded self-consciously as he
 walked away, she had been sure that the man was a
 pervert, that he was hitting on her at least. It was the
 uniform she guessed, what was it with men and
 uniforms? She looked down at the unflattering cut of
 it, the plain colour, the thick tights, the simple, black
 elasticated belt and didn't understand it at all. And
 then a thought struck her.</p>

<p>'Boss!' Sally's voice came out louder than she
 intended, almost a scream.</p>

<p>Delaney came crashing through the undergrowth
 closely followed by Danny Vine. Bob Wilkinson
 brought up the rear at a leisurely pace.</p>

<p>Delaney looked around, confused. 'What the hell
 happened, Sally?'</p>

<p>'I had a thought.' She could see he wasn't looking
 too impressed and rushed ahead before he could say
 more. 'About the belt buckle, sir.'</p>

<p>'What belt buckle?'</p>

<p>'That the dead girl was wearing. The silver buckle.
 The Green Man in the woods.'</p>

<p>She had his attention now. 'Go on.'</p>

<p>'"What are belt buckles for?" he said.'</p>

<p>'Get on with it, Sally.'</p>

<p>'Well, traditionally, when a nurse qualifies, they
 are often given a belt buckle by a loved one to mark
 it. Often silver. Often an old one. Victorian. That
 kind of thing.'</p>

<p>Delaney nodded, pleased.</p>

<p>'I think she's a nurse, sir.'</p>

<p>Delaney waved at Danny and Bob Wilkinson.
 'Okay, guys, I think we can call this off for now. You
 two get back to the station.'</p>

<p>Wilkinson looked at his watch and nodded. 'Five
 past bacon-butty o'clock.' He crooked his finger at
 Danny Vine. 'Come on, Kemo Sabe.'</p>

<p>Danny glared at him. 'That had better not be a
 racist remark.'</p>

<p>Wilkinson looked at him as though highly
 offended. 'I am a white male English policeman in his
 fifties, what are the chances of me being racist?'</p>

<p>Danny laughed. 'Absolutely none at all.'</p>

<p>'I'll even drink my tea with you.'</p>

<p>Delaney watched the uniforms walk away, the
 future and the past of the Metropolitan Police, and
 figured a blend of the two wasn't perhaps such a bad
 thing.</p>

<p>He turned back to Sally and nodded at her,
 pleased. 'Brains as well as beauty. Not sure there's a
 place for that on the job.'</p>

<p>Despite herself Sally felt herself blushing.
 Compliments from Jack Delaney were like goals from
 England trying to qualify for Euro 2008. Which, as
 her grandfather said at the time, were fucking few
 and fucking far between.</p>

<p>'Come on then, you can drive.'</p>

<p>Sally blinked. 'Where to?'</p>

<p>'South Hampstead Hospital. You should fit right
 in.'</p>

<p>Sally pulled her dark, woollen cloak about her,
 feeling like a character from a <emphasis>Carry On</emphasis> film, and set
 off following her boss to where his car was parked
 just off the common.</p>

<p>A few moments later, about thirty yards from where
 Sally had been, a dark-haired man zipped himself
 back up and scuffed up some wet leaves with the
 sharp toe of his boot to kick over the evidence of his
 shameful pleasures. Though, in truth, he felt no
 shame at all. Just the thrill of the hunt . . . the thrill
 of it beginning all over again.</p>

<p>Last night was just another chapter. Long way to
 go yet.</p>

<p>Delaney's expression was grim as he pushed open the
 main entrance door to the South Hampstead
 Hospital, the muscles in his jaw flexed and bunched
 as though he were chewing on gum rather than
 memories. Sally stole a sympathetic glance at him as
 they walked up to the reception desk. She knew why
 he didn't like hospitals, knew exactly why he didn't
 like this one in particular. His baby had died here
 after his wife, wounded badly by shotgun fire, had
 had to undergo an emergency Caesarean section.
 Very premature and traumatised by the injuries to his
 mother, the baby had survived only a matter of
 moments after the procedure. Delaney's wife survived
 her son's death by no more than a few minutes. Sally
 Cartwright knew that her boss still carried the guilt
 for both their deaths like a member of Opus Dei
 carries a scourge to beat themselves with daily.
 Delaney had never let the scar tissue heal, each day
 he'd make it bleed afresh.</p>

<p>She remembered reading the details of his wife's
 murder the day before; something about it had struck
 her as odd, but she didn't feel now was the right time
 to discuss it.</p>

<p>Delaney held his warrant card up to the bored-looking
 receptionist who betrayed no emotion at the
 display. Police and their warrant cards were, after all,
 not a rarity at any city hospital.</p>

<p>'I want to see whoever is in charge of the nurses
 here.'</p>

<p>The receptionist glanced back at her horoscope.
 Sally could see it was written by Jonathan Cainer.
 'Depends what wards they work on. They all have
 their own senior sisters.'</p>

<p>'I don't know what ward she worked on. Isn't
 there someone from personnel who deals with them
 all?'</p>

<p>Sally could hear the irritation in his voice. The
 receptionist picked up the phone. 'I'll see if I can find
 someone to talk to you. Can I ask what it is about?'</p>

<p>'It's about police business. Tell them that,' Delaney
 said curtly.</p>

<p>The receptionist sighed heavily and punched some
 numbers into the telephone keypad. Delaney walked
 across to read the notices pinned on the adjacent wall
 on the other side of the reception desk and Sally
 smiled apologetically at the woman behind the
 counter. 'He doesn't like hospitals very much.'</p>

<p>'Not really interested.'</p>

<p>Sally shrugged. 'What's he say for Capricorn?'</p>

<p>The receptionist looked back at her, frowning.
 'What?'</p>

<p>'Jonathan Cainer. He's very good, isn't he?'</p>

<p>The receptionist pointedly turned the page. 'I don't
 know. I only buy it for the Sudoku.'</p>

<p>Sally shrugged again, and wandered over to join
 Delaney as he was studying a poster advertising an
 STD drop-in clinic.</p>

<p>'Something you're worried about, sir?'</p>

<p>Delaney gave her a flat look. 'You may have done
 well with the belt buckle, Detective Constable, but
 don't push it.'</p>

<p>'Sir.' Sally grinned, she knew Delaney wasn't
 annoyed. Not with her at least.</p>

<p>A little while later, a short woman dressed in a
 navy-blue suit, with iron-grey hair cut fashionably
 short, strode briskly up to Delaney and thrust out her
 hand.</p>

<p>'Margaret Johnson. I understand you have some
 questions regarding one of our staff?'</p>

<p>Delaney shrugged. 'Possibly about one of your
 staff, Mrs Johnson.'</p>

<p>'Why don't you come through to my office?'</p>

<p>Margaret Johnson's office was surprisingly
 colourful and cluttered. She moved a stack of files
 from one of the chairs facing her desk and gestured at
 them to take a seat.</p>

<p>'What can I do to be of assistance?'</p>

<p>'We are trying to identify someone. We think she
 may have worked here.'</p>

<p>'And she's dead?'</p>

<p>'How would you know that?' Sally asked.</p>

<p>Margaret Johnson looked at her sadly. 'Call it an
 educated guess. If she wasn't dead she herself could
 tell you who she was, especially if you knew where
 she worked.'</p>

<p>Delaney placed a file on the desk in front of him.
 'I'm afraid these photos are going to be rather
 unpleasant to look at.'</p>

<p>'That's okay, Inspector.'</p>

<p>'You know all the nurses who work here?'</p>

<p>'I would have interviewed them all at least once,
 yes.'</p>

<p>Delaney opened the file. 'We're trying to find out
 who she is. She wore a belt with a distinctive buckle.
 It's why we think she might have been a nurse.'</p>

<p>He took out a ten by eight black-and-white photo
 of the belt and buckle and handed it across to her.</p>

<p>Sally leaned in. 'We thought it might have been a
 qualifying gift. She was found near the hospital and
 we figured she may have worked here.'</p>

<p>The woman nodded. 'It's a possibility. It's the sort
 of buckle that a nurse might well have. When you say
 she was found . . . may I ask what the circumstances
 were?'</p>

<p>'She was murdered,' Delaney said shortly. 'Her
 throat was cut and her body was slashed. Repeatedly,
 and with some force.'</p>

<p>Margaret Johnson swallowed and nodded at the
 folder, steeling herself. 'I had best take a look then.'</p>

<p>Delaney handed the file across to her and Sally
 could see moisture forming in the older woman's eyes
 as she looked through the photos one by one.</p>

<p>'The poor woman.' Her voice cracked, and she
 brushed the back of her hand across her eyes. 'I'm
 sorry.'</p>

<p>She handed the file back.</p>

<p>'I'm sorry you had to see those, but we need to
 know,' Delaney said.</p>

<p>'I meant I'm sorry because I can't help you.'</p>

<p>'Mrs Johnson?'</p>

<p>'She may well have been a nurse. But she didn't
 work here.'</p>

<p>The man looked at the answerphone by his bed. It
 was an old-fashioned one that he had never got
 around to replacing. You could have it through your
 line on BT so you didn't need a separate piece of
 equipment, but he had never cared for that. He liked
 the mechanics of things. He liked taking them apart
 to see how they worked. Always had. As a kid he had
 opened the backs of clocks to see the hidden, inner
 workings.</p>

<p>He looked again at the blinking light on the
 machine and felt no urge to play the message. He
 knew what it would be, but he had no time for petty
 distractions. Not today. Today he was on a high. He
 was floating. He was invincible.</p>

<p>He looked at the scuffed toes of his cowboy boots
 and reached down to peel a wet leaf from one of
 them. He held the leaf to his nose, smelling the
 mossy tones of it, the woodland smell, the faint but
 sweet smell of organic matter beginning to
 decompose. He rubbed his other hand on the crotch
 of his trousers, feeling himself harden again as he
 drew in another deep sniff of the leaf and looked at
 the photos he had taken of a young detective
 constable dressed in a nurse's uniform. She certainly
 was very pretty.</p>

<p>Delaney thanked Margaret Johnson once more and
 closed the door to her office behind him. He had
 made her look at the photos again and then asked her
 to pull the records of all the nurses currently working
 at the hospital. One by one they had gone through
 the records, looking at each passport photo attached
 to each nurse's personnel file and by the end of it
 were none the wiser. Margaret Johnson had been
 right. The dead woman had not been working at the
 South Hampstead Hospital. At least they knew that
 now, if precious little else.</p>

<p>Delaney could see Sally Cartwright's upbeat mood
 had been dented a little. Not because she would have
 wanted the glory of making the nursing connection,
 of that he was sure. She was disappointed, just like he
 was, that they hadn't been able to identify the
 woman. If they could do that then it was a start to
 identifying her killer. Put a name to her and then
 maybe they could track the sick bastard down before
 it was too late. Before he struck again. But in
 Delaney's heart, he knew that it was a distinct possibility
 that it was already too late. He turned to his
 assistant. 'Come on.'</p>

<p>'Where are we going, sir?'</p>

<p>'To the clap clinic.'</p>

<p>'I beg your pardon?</p>

<p>Delaney laughed drily, amused at the shocked look
 on the young detective constable's face. 'You start
 going out with uniform, it's best you know where it
 is.' He smiled again as Sally's face reddened and
 walked towards the stairs. 'Come on, it's on the third
 floor.'</p>

<p>Sally called after him and hurried to catch him up.
 'I hope you know that from reading the poster, sir.'</p>

<p>Delaney walked up the first flight of stairs and
 looked at the signs pointing off to the maternity
 clinic and back to A&amp;E and felt a fluttering in his
 heart. He stopped by the window and pulled out his
 mobile phone. 'You go on, Sally. I'll meet you at the
 top.'</p>

<p>'Sir?'</p>

<p>'I need to make a call.'</p>

<p>Sally continued up the stairs and he waited before
 she was out of sight before he hit the redial button on
 the phone. After Kate's answerphone message kicked
 in again he closed the phone, the blood draining from
 his face as he gazed down the familiar corridor.</p>

<p><emphasis>The nurse was a small dark-haired woman in her
 early twenties with delicate, almost oriental,
 features. Her hands were small too, but precise.
 She moved a pillow under the woman's head.
 The woman's eyes were closed, her breathing
 operated by an artificial respirator. The
 mechanical pumps making an obscene sound.
 Her body was invaded with tubes and wires, and
 the beat of the heart monitor sent out a contrapuntal
 and discordant rhythm to the respirator.
 She was living in form only.</emphasis></p>

<p><emphasis>Delaney stood at the foot of the bed as the
 nurse finished adjusting the pillow so that the
 woman's dark hair fanned neatly on it. There
 was no twitch beneath her eyelids, no smile
 tugging at the corner of her lips, and there never
 would be again. She was dead. All it needed was
 for Delaney to let them turn the machine off.</emphasis></p>

<p><emphasis>The consultant was sympathetic. 'If there was
 any hope at all I would advise against it. Of
 course I would, but the brain stem has suffered
 too much damage. For all intents and purposes
 she is already dead.'</emphasis></p>

<p><emphasis>Delaney looked at him for a long moment,
 scared to ask the question but needing to know
 the answer. 'And the baby?'</emphasis></p>

<p><emphasis>The consultant shook his head sadly. 'I'm
 sorry.'</emphasis></p>

<p><emphasis>Delaney's head nodded downward as he gave
 permission. He couldn't hold back the tears any
 longer. His world went dark as the obscenity of
 the pump ceased and the heart-monitor line
 became still.</emphasis></p>

<p>Delaney looked out of the window, his hand still
 clutching the phone like a rosary. He'd lost his wife
 and his baby in a matter of heartbeats four years ago
 and it had all but destroyed him. Now, though, he
 was being given a second chance. The woman he had
 come to love was carrying his child. His stupidity had
 almost lost her, but he'd be damned if he'd let
 anything or anyone come between them now. He
 opened the phone and hit speed dial. The phone rang
 at the other end and on the fifth ring cut into Kate's
 voice.</p>

<p>'This is Kate Walker. I am unavailable right now
 but leave me a message and I promise I will get back
 to you as soon as possible.'</p>

<p>'Kate. This is Jack. I'm sorry.' He sighed. 'I'm sorry
 about everything. Call me.'</p>

<p>He closed the phone and nodded to himself. He
 wasn't going to let history repeat itself. It was time to
 do the right thing. Finally.</p>

<p>Agnes Crabtree was sixty-eight years old and her
 knee joints were feeling every year of them that
 morning. The damp weather didn't help and Agnes's
 mood was even more depressed than usual. Six
 bloody months of winter nowadays. It would be
 April at least till there was a bit of warmth again and
 her aching bones might get some respite. Some doctor
 had been banging on about seasonal disorder on
 morning television earlier. SAD or something. And it
 was bloody sad. She made it up the flight of stairs
 and rested. Putting her bucket of cleaning materials
 on the floor and caught her breath. Not that she
 wanted to be breathing too deeply. The whole place
 smelled of piss. And not cat piss at that. Just as well
 she only cleaned on the inside of this flat, she
 reckoned. She groaned as she leaned over to pick up
 her equipment and fumbled a key into the lock of the
 flat. She took one or two steps into the flat, saw the
 long coloured scarf on the floor first and then
 registered what it was attached to. She tried to
 scream but her throat seized up with shock. She
 quickly stepped back, the pain in her knees ignored.
 The front door closed in her face and she finally
 found herself able to scream. She screamed again and
 stumbled backwards, her legs trembling. Her shaking
 hand went to her mouth and she took another step
 backwards, tripping over the can of Mr Sheen that
 had fallen from her dropped bucket. Her arms
 windmilled in the air as she lost her balance and
 crashed down the stairs. Her screams died as she
 landed at the bottom, her old head slapping on the
 wet concrete to lie at an odd angle, her eyes closed
 and a thin trickle of blood leaking from the corner of
 her mouth.</p>

<p>Delaney put his case on the table and pulled out a
 file. He removed the e-fit picture and handed it to Dr
 Andrew Burke, a silver-haired man in his early
 thirties. Delaney reckoned that maybe the rigours of
 his job, the sights he'd seen on a daily basis, had sent
 his hair prematurely grey.</p>

<p>The man shook his head as he studied the picture.
 'Sorry, he doesn't look familiar. He might have been
 in yesterday, you say?'</p>

<p>'Might have been.'</p>

<p>'I'll get Suzanne. She was on the morning shift
 yesterday. She might recognise him.'</p>

<p>The doctor left the room. Sally picked up the
 picture that the doctor had left on the desk. 'Why do
 you think he came here?'</p>

<p>'It's pretty common.'</p>

<p>'What is?'</p>

<p>'Flashers. Think about it, he gets to expose himself
 and have the goods handled at the same time.' He
 shrugged with a rueful smile. 'And if he's got a thing
 about nurses . . .'</p>

<p>Sally grimaced. 'Please tell me you're joking.'</p>

<p>Delaney grinned again. 'It's a sick world we live in,
 Sally.'</p>

<p>'You can say that again.'</p>

<p>'A pound to a penny our boy likes to get his pickle
 tickled.'</p>

<p>Sally frowned. 'Don't they stick little spoons up?'</p>

<p>Delaney nodded and Sally grimaced again. The
 office door opened and the doctor came back in
 followed by an Afro-Caribbean woman, five foot two
 and weighing close to a couple of hundred pounds by
 Delaney's reckoning, but she fitted into her neat,
 dark blue uniform like a Horse Guard on parade.</p>

<p>Andrew Burke gestured towards her. 'This is
 Suzanne.'</p>

<p>'How can I help you, Inspector?' Her voice was
 thick and rolling, like a wave of wind through a field
 of molasses cane.</p>

<p>Delaney held the photo out to her and she nodded.
 'Yes, bless him, he was here yesterday. If it's who I
 think it is.'</p>

<p>'Why bless him?'</p>

<p>'The poor lad. He's had some disfigurement.'</p>

<p>'Scarring to his penis?'</p>

<p>The nurse nodded. 'Indeed. And then he got a bit
 embarrassed when we did some tests.'</p>

<p>'Embarrassed?' Sally asked.</p>

<p>The nurse smiled at her. 'He got himself a little
 aroused. It does happen.'</p>

<p>Sally's scowl deepened.</p>

<p>Delaney took the photo from her. 'If you could let
 me have his name and contact details it would be very
 useful.'</p>

<p>'Sure. It will take a few minutes.'</p>

<p>'Quick as you can.'</p>

<p>Suzanne looked up sharply at the seriousness in his
 voice, and hurried away to get the information.</p>

<p>Outside the clinic Sally could barely contain her
 exuberance.</p>

<p>'You think he's our man, sir?'</p>

<p>'He's our flasher, that's about all we know for
 sure.'</p>

<p>'Should we call it in, send uniform round?'</p>

<p>'We'll take care of it, but first, as we're here, let's
 see if the Kraken has woken up.'</p>

<p>Sally looked at him puzzled. 'Sir?'</p>

<p>A stray dog slowly approached the motionless body
 of Agnes Crabtree, tentatively sniffing the air, and
 moved closer. It was a ragged thing. A composite of
 hair and bone and appetite, scabby, starving and
 neglected. It nuzzled Agnes's face with its jaw and
 scented the fresh blood that had spilled along the
 pitted line of her chin into a small, brown stain on the
 wet stone. The smell made the dog's stomach rumble
 and flex with pain. He opened his jaw wider and,
 taking the old woman's ear between his teeth, gave a
 little tug. Agnes Crabtree groaned and shifted but did
 not awaken and slumped again, her breath exhaling
 in a wet, barely audible sigh. But the dog had long
 gone by then, his tail between his legs and his meal
 forgotten. In his experience human beings never
 meant anything but pain.</p>

<p>Delaney looked down at the still motionless body of
 Kevin Norrell as Sally picked up his medical chart at
 the foot of the bed.</p>

<p>'He's lucky to be alive.'</p>

<p>'If he makes it.'</p>

<p>'What do you think he knows?'</p>

<p>'People talk in prison. They brag. Someone may
 have told him something. Maybe he was involved
 himself.' Delaney shrugged.</p>

<p>Sally hesitated then put Norrell's chart back and
 looked at her boss. 'Yesterday I looked at the reports,
 boss. The incident . . .'</p>

<p>Delaney, hearing the hesitation in her voice,
 glanced over at her. 'Just spit it out, Sally.'</p>

<p>'The hold-up at the petrol station.'</p>

<p>It flashed back unbidden into Delaney's mind. The
 darkness of the night split by the sound and the flare
 of lighting cracking. Of glass exploding, of tyres
 squealing and a woman's voice screaming, then
 silence. Those shards of glass flying through the night
 air like barbs of conscience to bury deep into
 Delaney's brain. The guilt hooking him, ever since,
 like a bloodstained puppet to jerk and twitch under
 the hand of a punishing god.</p>

<p>'What about it, Detective Constable?' he asked
 simply.</p>

<p>'They robbed the place. And then they left,
 shooting out the window. Why would they do that?'</p>

<p>'Because they're mindless thugs.'</p>

<p>'Maybe. But three heavily tooled-up villains and a
 driver? Sounds like a professional job to me.'</p>

<p>'Go on.'</p>

<p>'For a petrol station?' Sally shrugged. 'Makes no
 sense. Everyone knows they don't have the sort of
 cash on the premises to merit that kind of operation.'</p>

<p>Delaney took it in, the realisation giving him a
 feeling in his stomach akin to a lift dropping several
 floors quickly. Sally was right, he had been the worst
 kind of idiot. Four years of alcohol-induced rage, but
 it had been directed at himself not at the people really
 responsible. He'd been flailing around in his own
 misery and self-disgust to see what Sally had seen
 almost immediately. No self-respecting, professional
 outfit would target a petrol station, it made no sense.</p>

<p>'So, it wasn't a robbery?'</p>

<p>'No, sir, I don't think it was.' She looked at her
 boss sympathetically. 'I think it was a warning, and
 your wife just got in the way.'</p>

<p>'Warning to who?'</p>

<p>I don't know, sir.'</p>

<p>Delaney looked down at the sleeping figure of
 Kevin Norrell. The comatose man knew something,
 he was certain of that. But Sally had provided him
 with somewhere to start at least. Four years of
 nothing. Dead ends and false trails. And now his
 bright-eyed detective constable, fresh out of college,
 was seeing things he should have seen straight away.
 He cursed himself for a fool and then realised he
 didn't have the time for any more self-pity. It was
 time to put matters right.</p>

<p>'Come on then, Sally.'</p>

<p>'Where to?'</p>

<p>'Work.'</p>

<p>Delaney held the piece of paper the Afro-Caribbean
 nurse had given him tightly in his hand. The flasher
 was called Ashley Bradley, he was twenty-eight years
 old, on unemployment benefit and lived at 28b
 Morris Street in Chalk Farm, just a couple of stops
 down on the Northern Line from South Hampstead
 Tube.</p>

<p>He was heading for the exit when he saw a familiar
 face waiting at the lift. He stopped and waved Sally
 ahead. 'Wait for me in the car, Sally.' He tossed her
 the keys. 'You can drive.'</p>

<p>Sally looked over to where Delaney's gaze was
 focused and her mouth twisted in disapproval. 'Do
 you think that's a wise idea, sir?'</p>

<p>'Just do it, Constable.'</p>

<p>Sally walked on to the exit and Delaney crossed
 over to the lifts just as they opened. The man turned
 round as Delaney approached. 'Do you want to step
 away from me or do you want me to call security?' he
 said, a little nervous catch in his voice.</p>

<p>Delaney pushed him into the lift.</p>

<p>'What the hell do you think you're doing?'</p>

<p>He tried to force himself past Delaney and back
 out of the lift, but Delaney blocked his way, pushing
 the button for the fifth floor. The doors closed and
 Delaney turned to face him.</p>

<p>'You and I need to have a little talk.'</p>

<p>Paul Archer crossed his arms across his chest. 'The
 only person you need to talk to is a lawyer. Because
 you better believe I am calling the police.'</p>

<p>Delaney pulled out his warrant card. 'Can you hear
 my knees knocking?'</p>

<p>Archer leaned forward to read it and laughed
 humourlessly. 'Even better. You'll be out of a job as
 well.'</p>

<p>'Kate Walker was upset yesterday, I want to know
 why.'</p>

<p>'What business is it of yours?'</p>

<p>Delaney leaned in. 'Just answer the fucking
 question.'</p>

<p>Paul Archer smiled, which Delaney figured was a
 big mistake. He was moments away from smashing
 the smug look off his face and spoiling his looks for
 good.</p>

<p>'Whatever is between Kate and me is our concern
 and certainly none of yours.'</p>

<p>'You want to tell me now or do you want to be
 eating your meals through a straw for a couple of
 weeks?'</p>

<p>'Is that a threat, Inspector?'</p>

<p>Delaney stepped in closer. 'Does it sound like a
 threat?'</p>

<p>Archer moved back into the corner of the lift.
 'Don't touch me.' His hand involuntarily went up to
 touch his nose. 'She tell you she was fucking me the
 night before?'</p>

<p>Delaney was taken aback. 'Last night?'</p>

<p>Archer's eyes flickered as he corrected himself.
 'Not last night. The night before. She picked me up in
 the Holly Bush and took me back to hers. I told her
 it was just a one-night stand, but she wanted more.'</p>

<p>Delaney didn't say anything, taking it in.</p>

<p>Archer could see his words had hit home. 'Your
 problems with her are nothing to do with me,' he said
 as the lift door opened and he hurried past Delaney
 out of the lift.</p>

<p>Delaney watched him go then stabbed his finger on
 the ground-floor button. He couldn't blame Kate, it
 was exactly the sort of thing he would have done. He
 remembered that night, he remembered the hot
 breath of Stella Trant whispering in his ear. He had
 no moral high horse to ride on. He had no justification
 for being angry with Kate. But rationalisation
 was one thing, emotion another. The truth was he
 was fucking furious. He slammed his open hand hard
 against the side of the lift as the doors opened. A
 couple of nurses stepped back as he stormed past, but
 if he felt at all apologetic for startling them it
 certainly didn't show on his face.</p>

<p>Out in the car park Delaney opened the passenger
 door to his car, and got in, banging it behind him.
 Sally tried to fire up the engine as Delaney pulled out
 his mobile phone and punched in some numbers. The
 Saab coughed ineffectually a few times but turned
 over eventually after Sally gave the accelerator a
 couple of prods with her foot.</p>

<p>'When did you last have this serviced, sir?'</p>

<p>Delaney didn't answer. Instead he looked out of
 the passenger window as his call was answered.</p>

<p>'Jimmy, it's Jack. Have you got anything for us?'</p>

<p>'Nothing new,' Skinner answered.</p>

<p>'I'm just leaving South Hampstead Hospital, we've
 got a lead on the flasher.'</p>

<p>'Right.'</p>

<p>'Norrell hasn't regained consciousness and the
 other guy is holding to his story.'</p>

<p>'You believe him?'</p>

<p>'I believe they went after Norrell because they
 thought he was a nonce. But I don't believe that was
 why they were sicced on to him in the first place.'</p>

<p>'You being careful, Jack?'</p>

<p>'I'm doing what has to be done.'</p>

<p>'Keep me posted.'</p>

<p>Jack closed his phone and gestured at Sally. 'Come
 on, move it.'</p>

<p>'Chalk Farm, sir?'</p>

<p>'Not just yet.'</p>

<p>'Sir?'</p>

<p>Delaney looked at his watch. 'Pinner Green.'</p>

<p>Sally nodded and pulled the car away as Delaney's
 phone rang. He looked at who was calling and
 answered it. 'Hi, Diane.'</p>

<p>'Where are you, Jack?'</p>

<p>'Just following up a lead.'</p>

<p>'The boss wants you in for a press conference.'</p>

<p>'I'll get there when I can.'</p>

<p>'This lead, is it in connection with the South
 Hampstead Common case, or something else?'</p>

<p>'You wanted me back on the job, didn't you, guv?'</p>

<p>'Just don't let it get in the way. This turns out to be
 a serial killer and you fuck up on us, Jack, there's no
 way I can keep your nuts out of the vice.'</p>

<p>'Nice image.'</p>

<p>'Just don't let me down . . .'</p>

<p>'You got it.'</p>

<p>'And don't call me guv!'</p>

<p>Delaney closed his phone. Trouble was, he was
 good at that. Letting people down.</p>

<p>Jack Delaney and his wife had been eating dinner that
 Saturday night four years ago in a restaurant at the
 top of Pinner High Street. Just down from the church
 they had been married in, a Norman-style edifice that
 stood on top of the hill like a small, suburban castle.
 The restaurant served a pan-Asian menu, or Pacificrim
 fusion as the owner liked to call it. Whatever it
 was called, though, it wasn't to Jack's taste, he'd
 never really liked Chinese food. But it was his wife's
 favourite restaurant. It was their anniversary that
 evening and the truth was that Jack had a lot of
 making up to do to her. They had been arguing too
 much of late. Mainly about his job and the hours he
 worked. The risks he took. The danger on the streets,
 the growing proliferation of guns and knives in the
 hands of teenagers who, with no future ahead of
 them, valued others' lives as cheaply as their own
 were valued in turn. It was the same arguments that
 policemen and policewomen had with their spouses
 up and down the country and all around the world.
 But that wasn't all there was to it. Behind it all Jack
 knew the real reason for the growing tensions
 between them.</p>

<p>Sinead wanted to go back home. To leave England
 behind and return to her native Dublin, or move even
 further out into the country. Even as far as to the
 heathen, blighted, wind-blown and rain-soaked fields
 of Cork, whence Delaney had dragged his own sorry
 Irish arse. Jack had pointed out to her many times
 that he was ten years old when his parents had
 moved to England. Although he would hate to admit
 it to his colleagues, Jack felt that England was more
 of a home to him now than Ireland. His memories of
 it were fond enough, but mainly he remembered the
 lack of work, the lack of money, the struggles his
 parents had to put food on the table and leather on
 their feet. The opportunities London offered in the
 seventies for a man such as his father and a woman
 like his mother, God rest her soul, who were prepared
 to put in a long day's work were too good to
 refuse. And so the family had moved, like many
 before, across the waters to the mainland. His mother
 had died when he was eleven years old, run over in
 the early hours on her way to work by a hit-and-run
 driver whom the police never found and whose soul,
 Jack still hoped, was rotting in hell. And so it was his
 father who had pushed Jack into joining the police. A
 man needed a profession or a trade, Jack's dad
 reckoned, and as the boy had maybe the brains but
 not the inclination for a university degree he should
 look at the army, the navy or the police force. The
 idea of serving in Northern Ireland put any notions of
 joining the armed forces out of Jack's head. He
 couldn't see himself pointing a rifle at his Northern
 brothers, Catholic or Protestant, and he certainly
 couldn't envisage pulling the trigger. But the thought
 of joining the police had some appeal to him. Maybe
 it was the spectre of his mother's death, maybe it was
 just the knowledge that if he didn't join the police
 he'd go the way of his cousins who lived in Kilburn
 and made their money on the other side of the legal
 fence. And so he worked hard enough at school to get
 the right kind of grades to apply to the Met. Which
 he did when he was eighteen and hadn't regretted it
 since.</p>

<p>But lately Sinead had been, subtly at first, and then
 not so subtly, pushing him to take early retirement.
 Plenty of people left early, took up another profession.
 Something safer, something with regular
 hours. A job that meant she wouldn't be looking at
 the clock with dread, but with pleasure at the
 certainty of his arrival home at the given hour. The
 sound of a phone ringing wouldn't set her heart
 racing and her mouth dry every time she answered it,
 terrified that this call would be the one bringing the
 news she lived her life in fear of. And, moreover, their
 young girl, Siobhan, was three years old now. A
 walking, talking miniature human being with her
 future all before her. And she reminded him, time
 after time, although the bulge in her belly made it
 plain, that she was pregnant again and she wanted a
 secure future for all of them.</p>

<p>The trouble was that Jack Delaney didn't know
 what he would do back in Ireland. He was too young
 to retire. Too old to start a new career. And in truth
 he didn't want to. Jack loved his job. He loved the
 freedom of it, and although he might work long
 hours, they weren't hours spent behind a desk or in a
 neon-lit office, not for most of the time anyway. He
 got results and at the end of the day that was what
 really mattered. It's what mattered if you had a
 decent boss, that is. Someone who was more
 interested in banging up criminals than brown-nosing
 their way into senior management. And Jack's boss,
 Diane Campbell, was diamond.</p>

<p>So Jack didn't know what he was supposed to do.
 He loved his wife, really loved her. But the tensions
 over the last few months had put a strain on them
 both. And Jack had made a mistake. He'd had an
 affair. Not even an affair really, just a one-night
 stand, but the guilt of it ate away at him on a daily
 basis like a virus. Like a flesh-eating disease. And,
 because he felt guilty, he got angry, and covered it up
 by arguing with his wife. It was a vicious circle and
 Jack wasn't at all sure how to get out of it. But he had
 made an effort tonight and was grateful that he had
 had. They had had a lovely meal and a lovely
 evening. For the first time in ages they hadn't argued.
 They'd enjoyed each other's company, they'd made
 each other laugh and Jack couldn't for the life of him
 understand why he had strayed. And especially with
 whom.</p>

<p>As they had left the restaurant and started up the
 car engine, Sinead had insisted they get more petrol.
 Jack would have argued, he was well aware that they
 had enough in the tank to get home three times over,
 but it was one of his wife's pet foibles, she never let
 the petrol gauge drop below a quarter of a tank. And
 so they had turned right at the bottom of the hill and
 drove out of Pinner up to Pinner Green, where there
 was a petrol station that would be open at that time
 of day. It was a hot summer night, the heat still
 cooking the air and only the faintest breaths of wind.
 Venus was bright in the night sky and Delaney took
 it to be an omen. He pointed at the star. 'If men are
 from Mars and women are from Venus. And if men
 like bars, what do women like?'</p>

<p>Sinead laughed and slapped him on the arm. It was
 a musical laugh, like the sound of trickling mountain
 water over cool slate.</p>

<p>Delaney spun the wheel, turning into the forecourt
 of the petrol station. The adverts finished and the
 Cowboy Junkies started to play. 'Blue Moon'. One of
 Delaney's favourites. 'Now you can't tell me that
 isn't proper music.'</p>

<p>His wife laughed again. 'I can't tell you anything,
 Jack. I've learned that much by now.'</p>

<p>Delaney had got out of the car and popped open
 the petrol tank; he was reaching for the fuel nozzle
 when the plate-glass window of the shop exploded.
 Delaney instinctively raised his arm to protect his
 eyes from the storm of flying glass. His wife's scream
 carried over the sound of the shotgun blast and two
 men came out of the shop. Thickset men dressed in
 black with balaclavas covering their heads, shotguns
 held waist level, sweeping the forecourt in front of
 them.</p>

<p>They shouted at Delaney, but he couldn't hear
 them; their shotguns trained on him and he watched
 them frozen for a moment, until his wife screamed at
 him and her words finally registered.</p>

<p>'For Christ's sake, Jack, get in the car.'</p>

<p>And he did, watching as a Transit van drove
 through the forecourt with its back doors open. One
 of the men jumped in and the other ran to catch up.
 Delaney turned the key in the ignition and gunned the
 engine, not listening as his wife shouted at him,
 putting the car in gear and screeching after them,
 swerving to avoid an incoming car.</p>

<p>The second man jumped into the van, half falling
 back with the motion and landed with a bone-jarring
 crash on his knees, but a hand to the inside wall of
 the van steadied him and he brought his shotgun
 round to bear on the pursuing car. Delaney's wife
 screamed and the sound ripped into Delaney's
 consciousness like ice-cold water as he realised what
 he was doing. Too late. The shotgun fired again and
 Delaney's windscreen exploded, the car spinning out
 of control as the screaming blended with the
 screeching of brakes and the crumpling of metal . . .</p>

<p>Delaney shook his head to clear the thought and
 frowned as he pulled the car to a stop outside a block
 of upscale apartment buildings on the left-hand side
 of Pinner Green heading towards Northwood Hills.</p>

<p>'What's up, boss?'</p>

<p>'The petrol station.'</p>

<p>'What about it?'</p>

<p>'It's not here any more.'</p>

<p>Jenny Hickling turned back to the fifteen-year-old
 boy who was following her. Nervously flicking his
 long and greasy hair like a girl.</p>

<p>'Get a move on for fuck's sake. I ain't got all
 fucking day.'</p>

<p>'All right, keep your knickers on.'</p>

<p>'That supposed to be funny?'</p>

<p>The boy shuffled after her. His jeans were hanging
 off his scrawny arse gangsta-style, and although he
 swaggered as best he could, Jenny reckoned he wasn't
 as cocksure as he thought he was. She knew the type,
 posh kids bunking off from the grammar school up
 the road, dressing like hoodies and trying to talk the
 talk. About as convincing as her uncle Gerard who
 used to dress up as Marilyn Monroe at every
 opportunity, complete with a blonde wig and five
 o'clock shadow. She reckoned the boy was cherry.
 She'd probably get away with only a couple of
 strokes and the scratch of her fingernail across the
 business end before he'd shoot his load. She'd agreed
 to give him a blow job but she reckoned she wouldn't
 have to. She wasn't bothered about giving him a
 suck, it was just she weren't going to let him stick it
 in her mouth unprotected and she hated the taste of
 latex. It reminded her of the washing-up gloves her
 bitch of an Irish mother used to wear when she
 washed her mouth out for swearing. Before Jenny
 grew too big of course. She had believed the threat
 that if she tried to do it one more fucking time she'd
 wake up with a fucking carving knife in her throat, if
 that wasn't what her pervert English teacher, Mr
 Gingernut Collier, called a contradiction in fucking
 terms. She looked back at the kid who was still
 limping along behind. He wanted it, that much was
 clear, but he was still nervous as shite. His older
 brother was at the University of Middlesex, wherever
 the fuck that was, and he had nicked some gear off
 him. Primo gear, he had called it, like something he
 had heard on late-night TV. But if Jenny guessed
 right the prissy boy wouldn't know primo gear from
 a knobbly stick up his arse.</p>

<p>She turned the corner into the backyard of a block
 of flats. The bottom corridors weren't overlooked,
 and if she had a penny for every dick she'd dealt with
 back there she'd have a good pound or two and no
 fucking mistake.</p>

<p>'Will you get a fecking move on?'</p>

<p>She walked up the step into the covered walkway
 where the wheelie bins were kept and stopped dead
 in her tracks. The body of Agnes Crabtree lay right in
 front of her. One leg trailing up the steps and her
 head at an angle God hadn't intended. She was pretty
 sure of that.</p>

<p>She turned back to the pimply teenager who had
 turned white as a sheet and was running away as fast
 as he could move. Which wasn't very fast; she almost
 laughed when he tripped over and landed head first
 in a puddle, but the smile died as soon as it was born
 as she realised the little gobshite had taken the gear,
 primo, or otherwise with him.</p>

<p>She pulled out her mobile phone and dialled 999.
 'Ambulance. There's an old lady here not looking so
 tickety-fucking-boo.'</p>

<p>She gave the woman on the other end of the line
 the address, then grimaced when she asked her how
 old she was. 'I'm fourteen, so I won't be here when
 they get here, all right.' She closed the phone down,
 then cursed, they'd be able to trace her from her
 phone number. But she reckoned the woodentops, as
 her mother called them, would have better things to
 do than chase up a bleeding truancy.</p>

<p>She looked down at the body of Agnes Crabtree. 'I
 hope they sort you out, missus.' Then she set off in
 pursuit of the pimply boy, though she reckoned his
 knob must have shrivelled to the size of an acorn at
 the sight of the dead woman, if it hadn't retracted up
 inside him altogether.</p>

<p>Delaney looked out of the passenger window as they
 drove along the Western Avenue, at least the rain
 had stopped, but the flyover was clogged fairly
 solidly as they moved slowly towards White City. He
 looked over to where the old dog-racing track used
 to be and realised how much London had changed
 over the last twenty years or so. And not for the
 better. Delaney had a theory that a city could only
 take so many people. Too many rats in a cage meant
 that some, already feral, turned psychotic and in his
 experience humans were no different. It might not be
 against the laws of God for so many millions of
 people to be crammed together in one space, but it
 was certainly against the laws of nature. We are the
 architects of our own destruction sure enough, he
 thought drily. He should have got out of London
 when he had a chance. If he had listened to his wife
 four years ago things would have turned out very
 different.</p>

<p>He'd never have met Kate, and once again
 Delaney's stomach gripped with the guilt of it all.
 London might be a mess but he himself was a walking
 fucking disaster area. And he knew it. Maybe this
 was it though. Maybe he had a chance to rewrite
 history, almost. A second chance. Maybe Kate was
 his salvation.</p>

<p>The traffic cleared and Sally was able to floor the
 accelerator and they drove past the White City police
 station and soon they were at Chalk Farm.</p>

<p>He had to live on the third floor Delaney thought
 as they trudged up the steps, out of breath and
 figuring, yet again, it was time for a new fitness
 regime. A man clattered by in army fatigues and a
 woollen hat. Delaney stood aside to let him pass. The
 man was probably carrying, which was why he was
 so keen to get past, but Delaney had other fish to fry.
 He carried on to the third floor where Sally
 Cartwright was already waiting for him, not a hair
 out of place nor the slightest evidence of any exertion
 on her part.</p>

<p>'What are you waiting for, Sally? Bang on the
 door!' he snapped.</p>

<p>Sally smiled thinly and rapped hard on the door.
 After a short while with no response Delaney stepped
 forward and banged harder, and they heard the
 sound of a chain being lifted and the face of a small,
 white-haired, elderly woman peered out.</p>

<p>'I'm not interested in Jehovah or shoe brushes.'</p>

<p>Delaney knew how she felt. He held out his
 warrant card. 'Detective Inspector Jack Delaney, and
 this is Constable Sally Cartwright.'</p>

<p>'He hasn't done anything wrong.' She tried to
 shut the door but Delaney held it open with his
 hand.</p>

<p>'Who hasn't done anything wrong?'</p>

<p>The elderly woman shook her head. 'I should
 speak to a lawyer first. That's right, isn't it?'</p>

<p>Sally smiled at her reassuringly. 'What are you
 talking about?'</p>

<p>The woman shook her head again. 'I don't know
 anything about it, and he was with me the whole
 time.'</p>

<p>'Is Ashley Bradley your son?' Sally asked.</p>

<p>The woman shook her disarrayed white hair. 'He's
 my grandson. I told them never to get that dog, I
 knew it would end in tears.'</p>

<p>'Where is he, Mrs Bradley?'</p>

<p>The woman shook her head. 'You just missed him.'</p>

<p>Delaney cursed himself. 'Army-type clothes and a
 woolly hat?'</p>

<p>'That's right. He's gone. But he's been with me all
 the other times.'</p>

<p>'Can we come in, Mrs Bradley?'</p>

<p>'The woman shook her head nervously. 'I'm
 having my Weetabix.'</p>

<p>Delaney would have responded but his phone rang,
 startling him out of his introspection, and he snapped
 it open. 'Delaney.'</p>

<p>'Jack, it's Diane.'</p>

<p>'I'm on it.'</p>

<p>'Never mind that. Where are you?'</p>

<p>'Chalk Farm, why?'</p>

<p>'Good. I need you to get to Camden Town.'</p>

<p>'What's going on?'</p>

<p>'We think there might be another one. And it's
 bad, Jack. Really bad.'</p>

<p>'Give me the address.' He listened as Diane gave
 him the details and closed the phone. 'Come on,
 Sally, we're out of here.' He turned back to the old
 lady. 'We'll be back.'</p>

<p>They hurried back down the stairs and Delaney
 pulled out his phone again, hitting the speed dial. It
 rang for a few times, again, and then cut into Kate's
 voice message again. He snapped the phone angrily
 shut. 'Where the bloody hell is she?'</p>

<p>'Sir?'</p>

<p>Delaney hadn't realised he had spoken aloud.
 'Don't worry about it, Sally, just get us to Camden.'</p>

<p>Just as a human face is a map, in most cases, of the
 kind of life a person has had – sad, happy, hopeful,
 despairing – so a building has a personality every bit
 as decipherable. Grosvenor Court in Camden Town
 was built in an era that had more hope than it
 deserved. Hope that experience soon wiped off its
 facade, just as the bright green paint was now faded,
 scabby and sore.</p>

<p>The apartments were built on three sides of a
 square, with a car park in the middle. A single police
 car blocked the back entrance. Sally pulled Delaney's
 Saab to a groaning stop alongside the police car and
 they both got out.</p>

<p>It wasn't even lunchtime yet but Delaney was
 yawning expansively. He had hardly slept the night
 before. After Kate had left him in the Holly Bush and
 wouldn't answer her door to him he had gone home,
 where, for the first time in four years, he didn't even
 contemplate drinking himself into his usual oblivion.
 But the night had brought no relief in sleep, as he
 knew it wouldn't. It was part of the price he had to
 pay.</p>

<p>Danny Vine was waiting at the bottom of the stairs
 with Bob Wilkinson and the police photographer,
 Delaney couldn't remember his name, and a couple
 of SOCOs. They were waiting for Delaney to see the
 scene before recording every detail. Bob nodded at
 Sally and Delaney as they approached. 'I hope you
 haven't had breakfast.' He wasn't joking.</p>

<p>Delaney didn't reply. He hadn't eaten since the
 bacon sandwich he had had for lunch yesterday, but
 sensed this wasn't the time for small talk. He could
 see it in the pale faces of the three men watching him.</p>

<p>'Who called it in?'</p>

<p>'The cleaner. She walked in on it. Staggered back
 and fell down the stairs. Nearly broke her neck. She
 came round in the ambulance and the paramedics
 alerted us.'</p>

<p>Delaney walked up the stairs and two uniformed
 policemen at the top stood aside. Their faces were
 drained, one was shaking visibly. Delaney pushed
 open the door and stepped into the darkness of the
 room, Sally following closely behind.</p>

<p>Delaney's eyes didn't need time to adjust to see
 what lay on the floor. What had once been a human
 being was now rendered into a thing of slaughter and
 his world tilted on its axis once more. Delaney's heart
 felt like it had been gripped by a hand made of frozen
 steel and he gasped out loud. He fought to catch his
 breath. He wanted to tear his eyes away from what
 he was looking at but couldn't. Among all the blood
 and ripped flesh, among the blood sprayed on the
 walls and the tissue splayed over the floor and the
 guts strewn like the wet, grey tubing of a squid's
 tentacles, was what was left of a once beautiful
 woman; she had hair the colour of blue midnight, lips
 as sweet as an Elgar cello concerto and a scarf trailed
 around her naked body soaked in her blood. A long,
 thick and multicoloured scarf, just like Doctor Who
 used to wear.</p>

<p>'Kate . . .' Delaney's voice was a tortured whisper.</p>

<p>And the roaring in his ears was like an ocean now.</p>

<p>Delaney gagged, again, and turned and stumbled
 from the room. Outside he turned and half ran, half
 fell to the end of the walkway, where he bent over
 and retched, sank to his knees, coughed and retched
 again, gagged until there was nothing left in him to
 throw up.</p>

<p>Superintendent George Napier looked at his wristwatch
 and took a sip of coffee. One of the first
 things he had done when taking over the office was
 to bring in his own espresso coffee maker. A hand-pumped
 La Pavoni machine, a design classic in shiny
 chrome. He ground his own beans, a particular
 coffee he ordered over the Internet called Jumbo
 Maragogype – the elephant bean. He swallowed and
 sighed. One cup of real coffee and ten minutes to
 himself, if he could organise it, was a small luxury he
 could rarely afford.</p>

<p>The telephone on his desk rang and he deliberated
 for a moment or two before answering but finally
 snatched it up.</p>

<p>'Napier.'</p>

<p>He listened for a moment, the frown on his
 forehead deepening. He nodded finally. 'I'll take care
 of it.' He replaced the phone in its cradle and sighed
 as he looked at his cup of coffee. The moment was
 ruined. 'Bloody Irishman!' he said and slammed his
 hand on his desk, causing his phone to rattle and his
 precious coffee to spill out on the perfect order of his
 highly polished desk. But Napier didn't even register
 it. 'Damn them all,' he said and slammed his hand
 down again.</p>

<p>'It's not her, sir.'</p>

<p>Delaney could barely hear the words. He wiped the
 sleeve of his jacket across his mouth and looked up to
 see Sally standing above him. 'What?'</p>

<p>'It's not her, sir. It's not Dr Walker. It's her scarf,
 by the looks of it, but it's not her. That woman. She's
 wearing a wig.' She could barely get the words out.
 'She was wearing a wig.' She corrected herself.</p>

<p>Sally took a step towards him and then had to put
 her hand on the wall. She looked down to the car park
 below. Taking a few deep breaths herself. Her face
 was the colour of a white lily pressed in an old hymnal.</p>

<p>Delaney took a long swig of water from the bottle
 that Sally had just given him and wiped his mouth as
 Diane Campbell came up the steps and walked over
 to join them.</p>

<p>'You got anything for me?'</p>

<p>Delaney shook his head. 'Just got here, Diane.'</p>

<p>'Is it the same guy?</p>

<p>Delaney shrugged. 'It's the same kind of butchery.
 Worse than the first.'</p>

<p>'Is he escalating?'</p>

<p>Delaney gestured helplessly. 'Seems to be, but
 honestly, I don't know, boss. We're pretty much in
 the dark here.'</p>

<p>'What about the suspect? The flasher?'</p>

<p>'We've tracked him down but he wasn't at home.'</p>

<p>'Why don't you get out of here and go and find
 him then?'</p>

<p>'Shouldn't I stay here, process the scene?'</p>

<p>'I've got it covered. The super is on his way over,
 cowboy. He wants your balls in a chocolate fountain
 and served up at the ambassador's party.'</p>

<p>Delaney grimaced. 'The guy from the hospital
 made a complaint?'</p>

<p>Campbell shook her head dismissively. 'You can
 tell me about it later.' She jerked her thumb back
 towards the murder scene. 'For now we have more
 important things to worry about than some paediatrician
 you've been having a pissing competition
 with. Now fuck off before he gets here.'</p>

<p>Delaney gestured to Sally Cartwright and led her
 back down the stairs. Campbell watched them leave
 for a moment and then put a cigarette in her mouth
 and then barked at the uniform standing by the open
 door. 'Get me a sodding light!'</p>

<p>Delaney held his warrant card up again for the old
 lady at the door to read, but she knew very well who
 he was. She backed away resignedly as Delaney and
 Sally walked in. Delaney told the two uniforms that
 were with them to wait outside and keep an eye out
 for Ashley Bradley, and if the little bastard ran they
 had better damn well catch him.</p>

<p>Mrs Bradley led Delaney to the back of the flat to
 her grandson's bedroom. Delaney didn't consider
 him likely for the two killings. It was a very big step
 from flashing nurses on the common to murder and
 mutilation. It did happen of course. Serial killers were
 often profiled as having been cruel to animals in their
 youth, going on to sex offences like peeping through
 windows and flashing before maturing into full-time
 psychopaths. It was pretty bloody rare for it to
 happen overnight, mind.</p>

<p>The door to Ashley Bradley's bedroom was locked
 and his grandmother didn't have a key. Delaney
 didn't even apologise as he used his shoulder to
 smash the door open. But what he saw inside made
 him rethink the matter entirely and curse himself for
 every kind of fool in God's cruel Christendom.</p>

<p>Superintendent George Napier stood at the top of the
 stairs at the flats in Camden Town, glaring at Diane
 Campbell as she took another satisfying drag on her
 cigarette.</p>

<p>'Is that absolutely necessary?'</p>

<p>Diane jerked her cigarette back at the crime scene
 where the suited-up SOCOs were now processing
 every square inch. 'Have you seen what he did to her
 in there?'</p>

<p>'You know damn well I haven't.'</p>

<p>Diane took another drag on her cigarette and
 pointedly blew out a long stream of smoke. 'Talk to
 me about it when you have then.'</p>

<p>Napier looked far from happy but let it rest.
 'Where's Delaney?'</p>

<p>'Following up a lead.'</p>

<p>'I've had a complaint that he assaulted a paediatrician
 at South Hampstead Hospital yesterday morning
 and then physically threatened him again today.'</p>

<p>'I'm sure he had his reasons.'</p>

<p>'I don't give a damn if he had his reasons or not. I
 will not have members of my police force roaming
 around assaulting members of the public.'</p>

<p>'I'll have a word, sir.'</p>

<p>'You'll do more than that. I want him suspended
 pending a full inquiry.'</p>

<p>'Why don't we get his version of events before we
 do anything?'</p>

<p>'The man's a loose cannon, you know that, Diane.
 But he's gone too far this time. I want him closed
 down.'</p>

<p>'Can't do that, sir.'</p>

<p>'You'll do as you're damn well told. This ain't
 Dodge City, Chief Inspector.'</p>

<p>'Why don't you tell that to the press?'</p>

<p>'What are you talking about?'</p>

<p>Diane pointed her cigarette behind the superintendent.
 'Melanie Jones seems to think the killer
 has some kind of connection with Jack Delaney. She
 wants to liaise with him about it.'</p>

<p>George Napier swore under his breath as he turned
 round to see Melanie Jones and her cameraman
 coming up the stairs towards them.</p>

<p>'How the hell did she know about this?' he hissed.</p>

<p>'Seems the killer has a thing about her too. Likes to
 call her up for cosy chit-chats.'</p>

<p>Napier turned his back on the approaching
 reporter. 'Jesus Christ, Diane. This kind of thing can
 ruin careers.'</p>

<p>'If Jack is suspended, sir, I guess she can deal with
 you.'</p>

<p>Napier glared at her. 'You've made your bloody
 point, Diane. Let's not push it, eh?'</p>

<p>Delaney stood in the centre of the small room. A bed
 in the corner, a wardrobe, a desk with a laptop
 computer on it and a digital camera beside it. A stack
 of pornographic magazines at the base of the bed
 with a waste-paper basket beside it full of old tissues.
 He picked up a couple of the magazines and flicked
 through the titles, voyeuristic stuff mainly, peeping
 Tom-type shots. Posed for the camera as though the
 subject was unaware the camera was there. And
 every spare inch of every wall of the room covered
 with photographs. Photographs of women genuinely
 unaware they were being photographed. A lot of
 them from South Hampstead Heath. A lot of them in
 nurse's uniform.</p>

<p>Sally waved a hand under her nose. The odour in
 the room was overpowering and distinctly unpleasant.
 The smell of stale sex. Solitary, self-administered
 sex. She crossed to the curtains, opened them and
 after struggling with the catch managed to release the
 window, letting a little fresh air into the room. She
 glanced at the waste-paper basket and grimaced at
 Delaney. 'The greatest love of all.'</p>

<p>But Delaney wasn't listening, he was staring at the
 photos on the wall.</p>

<p>'Have a look here, Sally.' He was pointing at a
 photo on the wall near to the desk. It was of a dark-haired
 woman dressed goth-style and walking on the
 South Hampstead common.</p>

<p>Sally looked at the picture. 'It's hard to tell, sir. The
 make-up makes them all look alike. Goths, I mean.'</p>

<p>Delaney tapped at the picture. 'Blow this up and
 I'll bet you we'll see a belt buckle with two green men
 on it.'</p>

<p>'It does look like her.'</p>

<p>'Check all the others.'</p>

<p>Sally and Delaney methodically worked their way
 along the photos. After five minutes Sally stopped
 and looked at a picture.</p>

<p>'I think this is the second one, sir. She's got blonde
 hair, but I think it's her.'</p>

<p>Delaney walked across and looked. The hair
 colouring was different but the face was the same, she
 was dressed in a nurse's uniform from South
 Hampstead Hospital. It felt like someone had
 punched him in the stomach. He deserved it. 'Shit!'
 he said.</p>

<p>'Sir?'</p>

<p>'We let the sick fuck get away.'</p>

<p>There is a connection between life and death.
 Delaney believed in that, if he didn't believe in much
 else. When he was four years old and living in
 Ballydehob, he had been bundled out of the house
 one day during the summer holidays. His two older,
 twin cousins, Mary and Clare, had taken him down
 to the old railway viaduct over the river. It was a
 scorching hot day and he had been given ice cream
 and lemonade in the village, then taken down to the
 river and up on the viaduct where they allowed him
 to pick up pebbles and throw them into the water
 cascading far below.</p>

<p>A crow had landed on the spur of green land under
 the entrance to the viaduct where they were standing,
 high overhead and just by the lamp post. The girls,
 older than him by some eight years, looked on Jack
 as their own little walking, talking doll. They told
 him that the crow was actually a raven. When Jack
 threw a pebble and it took off squawking in the air,
 the girls had said that it was a bad omen. The raven
 was an omen of death. And Jack, as susceptible to
 superstition as an Irishman from Cork is wont to be,
 believed them. But when they returned home late that
 afternoon, with the sound of laughter and bustle
 coming from the house like it was almost Christmas,
 Jack, swinging between them, dangling from their
 longer arms like a curly-haired monkey, picked up on
 the atmosphere and smiled even more broadly for no
 reason at all. But as soon as they entered the chaos of
 the house it became clear why Jack was being treated
 to a trip out with his beautiful cousins. His mother
 had given birth to a daughter. A young sister for
 Jack. And although he didn't really understand what
 was going on he knew it was a special day.</p>

<p>Before the day was spent, however, eleven o'clock
 at night with the moon hanging low and enormous in
 the summer sky like a swollen exotic fruit, his silver-haired
 grandfather, eighty-three years old, had died.
 And Delaney would never see a crow or a rook again
 without shivering slightly, although in his heart, deep
 down, he knew the raven had not been meant for his
 grandfather. But there was a cycle to life, and death
 was part of that. Jack grasped that from a very early
 age.</p>

<p>How that connection worked, though, in the case
 of the murdered and mutilated woman that had been
 obscenely decorated with a scarf just like Kate
 Walker's, Delaney wasn't quite so sure. But he knew
 evil wasn't an abstract concept.</p>

<p>He was far from hungry. After what he had
 witnessed a short while ago he felt as if he might
 never eat again. But his energy levels were low and
 his brain told him he needed nourishment, so he was
 standing outside the burger van chain-smoking and
 trying to wash the memory of what he had witnessed
 from his mind. He held his cigarette to his lips and
 realised his hands were still shaking. He couldn't
 keep the images away and he knew what would be
 written in the pathologist's clinical report.</p>

<p><emphasis>Her left arm was placed across the left breast.
 The body was terribly mutilated</emphasis> . . . <emphasis>the throat
 was severed deeply, the incision through the skin
 jagged, and reaching right round the neck. The
 body had lost a great quantity of blood. There
 was no evidence of a struggle having taken place.
 The scarf was draped around her savaged neck.
 There were two distinct, clean cuts on the left
 side of the spine. They were parallel with each
 other and separated by about half an inch. The
 muscular structures appeared as though an
 attempt had made to separate the bones of the
 neck.</emphasis></p>

<p><emphasis>The abdomen had been entirely laid open: the
 intestines, severed from their attachments, had
 been lifted out of the body and placed on the
 shoulder of the corpse; while from the pelvis, the
 uterus and its appendages with the upper
 portion of the vagina and the posterior two-thirds
 of the bladder, had been entirely removed.</emphasis></p>

<p>'Inspector?'</p>

<p>Delaney, startled out of his reverie, looked up at
 the florid face of the short-order chef.</p>

<p>'You want onions with this?'</p>

<p>Roy held up the burger and Delaney shook his
 head, not sure he had the stomach for it right then.</p>

<p>'You all right, sir?' Sally asked.</p>

<p>Delaney didn't reply, pulling out his mobile phone
 and tapping in some numbers. After a while the call
 was answered. The familiar voice purring with self-content.</p>

<p>'Melanie Jones.'</p>

<p>'Melanie. It's Jack Delaney.'</p>

<p>'I was just about to call you,'</p>

<p>'Why?'</p>

<p>'Because he just called me again.'</p>

<p>'And . . .'</p>

<p>'He said to give you another message.'</p>

<p>'What was it?'</p>

<p>'He said for you to start with the man in the
 mirror.'</p>

<p>'What's that mean?'</p>

<p>'I don't know, Jack. That's all he said. Then he
 hung up.'</p>

<p>Delaney clenched his fist. 'Do you have any idea
 what he did to that woman?'</p>

<p>'They haven't given me any details, no.'</p>

<p>'I find out you're jerking me around and I am
 going to visit vengeance on you like a biblical fucking
 angel.'</p>

<p>'Great line. Can I use that?'</p>

<p>Delaney spoke quietly but furiously. 'Do you
 believe me, when I say it?'</p>

<p>'All right, yes. I believe you. You're the arch-fucking-angel
 of death and justice. I'm telling you
 what he's told me. What more do you want me to
 do?'</p>

<p>'I'll let you know.' Delaney cut the call off. He
 quickly scrolled to Kate's number once more and
 snapped the phone angrily shut when it cut into her
 answerphone yet again. Where the bloody hell was
 she?</p>

<p>Sally walked over to him, holding out his burger.
 Delaney snatched it off her, took one look at it and
 threw it in the bin.</p>

<p>'Oi!' Roy shouted out.</p>

<p>Delaney glared up at him. 'Not now, all right?' He
 turned to Sally. 'Come on.'</p>

<p>'Where are we going?'</p>

<p>If Sally was hoping for further enlightenment, it
 wasn't forthcoming as Delaney was already striding
 quickly away.</p>

<p>Roy leaned over the counter and called after him.
 'Jack Delaney. International man of misery!' He
 grinned, pleased with himself, then went back to
 reading his Peter F. Hamilton.</p>

<p>In Hampstead village itself, a light drizzle had
 started. And the wind made the air far colder than it
 should have been for the time of year. Kate locked
 her car door then pulled her coat tighter to herself,
 hugging her arms around her body as she walked,
 head down, across the road.</p>

<p>She walked up to the front door but hesitated
 before knocking on it. She had taken the morning off
 to meet with this woman, but now that it came to it,
 she wasn't sure she could go through with it.</p>

<p>After she had left Delaney the previous night, she
 had stood outside the Holly Bush for a moment or
 two, furious and hurt. Really hurt and hating herself
 for it. She couldn't face being alone that night so she
 had flagged down a passing cab and told the driver to
 take her out of Hampstead. When he had asked her
 where to go she honestly had no idea, but then told
 him to take her to Highgate. She needed a friend. But
 at her friend's front door she had hesitated, wanting
 to ring the bell but fearing conversation. Knowing
 that if she articulated her thoughts she would break
 down in tears. The rain had started falling in earnest
 when Kate finally pushed the doorbell. The chimes
 sounded as though from a different world. A world
 of comfort and security. A world that Kate felt as
 though she had been ripped away from and was not
 sure she would ever find her way back to.</p>

<p>The door had opened and it had been like standing
 in front of an open fire after a winter storm.</p>

<p>'For God's sake, Kate! How long have you been
 out there? You look like a drowned rat.'</p>

<p>Kate had stumbled in and Jane had put her strong
 arms around her, stroking her wet hair as the tears
 poured down Kate's cheeks and she sobbed like a
 hurt child.</p>

<p>The next morning, back in Hampstead village at
 another front door, Kate took a deep breath and
 willed her finger forward, knowing if she pushed the
 bell the world might change for ever.</p>

<p>The chimes played a tune Kate felt sure she should
 recognise but couldn't quite place. The door opened
 and Helen Archer looked out at her. She was a
 beautiful woman somewhere in her thirties, Kate
 guessed, with long blonde hair the colour of antique
 pine with threads of amber gold. Her eyes were
 startling, wide and doll-like. But Kate could see
 behind those painted eyes an innocence that had been
 betrayed long ago. A hurt that was beyond
 restoration. She had seen it before, in her own eyes.</p>

<p>'You must be Dr Walker.'</p>

<p>'It's Kate, please.'</p>

<p>The woman stepped back and gestured with her
 arm. 'Come in, Kate.'</p>

<p>Across the road Paul Archer rolled down his
 window and stared at the door as it closed behind the
 pair of them. He put a hand subconsciously to his
 nose.</p>

<p>There was nothing kind in his eyes.</p>

<p>Roger Yates was sitting behind his desk in a plush
 office. It was a partner's desk, green leather on the
 top with a rich patina on the wood which only comes
 after a few hundred years. There was nothing repro
 about the office. The paintings on the wall were
 originals and insured for many thousands of pounds.
 Roger believed that the outward expression of wealth
 was one of the main pleasures in life. What would be
 the point of being as rich as Croesus if poorer people
 weren't made aware of it? It would be like having a
 supermodel figure and wearing a burka, if you asked
 him. Sackcloth and ashes were all very well for the
 Jesuits and the Presbyterians but his shirts were made
 in Jermyn Street of silk, not hair, and he always
 turned left when boarding an aeroplane. Not that he
 wasn't a generous man. He gave more than most
 people's salaries to charity each year, and he always
 made a point of buying the <emphasis>Big Issue</emphasis>. And he was
 popular. For some reason his opulent lifestyle and big
 gestures didn't engender envy in people. He bought
 himself a new jag every year and had never had it
 keyed once. The <emphasis>Big Issue</emphasis> seller always smiled when
 he saw him, not at all resentful that his watch alone
 could have housed him in fine style for a year.</p>

<p>Maybe it was down to his good looks. He had
 always been a handsome man, six foot tall, a
 generous head of hair. Naturally perfect teeth housed
 in an effortless smile, and blue, honest eyes that held
 your gaze and commanded trust.</p>

<p>Roger was an accountant. He'd been to Harrow
 and Oxford and somehow felt he should have done
 something more glamorous as a career. But he came
 from old money, and the Yateses had been in finance
 in one way or another since the Great Fire of
 London; Roger's career had been mapped out for him
 long before his name had even gone down for prep
 school. In truth, he was secretly glad of the
 arrangement, not that he'd ever really admit it to
 himself, because Roger liked order in his life. He
 liked to know what the next day would bring, what
 the next week would bring, what the next year would
 bring. He liked to be in control. He liked discipline.
 Which is why the morning, which had started badly
 – he had had to cancel a golf tournament, something
 he had been looking forward to all year – had gone
 from bad to worse, and the reason for it, the one
 main thing in his life that Roger wasn't content with
 and seemed powerless to do anything about, was
 now standing, larger than life and twice as ugly, in
 front of his desk.</p>

<p>'Roger,' Delaney said.</p>

<p>'Jack, what the hell are you doing here?'</p>

<p>'I've been great thanks. How about yourself?'</p>

<p>Roger leaned back in his chair, his scowl
 deepening. 'Let me think about that for a moment.
 How have I been? Well, I'll tell you.' He held his
 hand out to count off on his fingers. 'Firstly I had to
 cancel a golf tournament this weekend. And that's
 because . . . Secondly my wife is coming out of
 hospital. My wife who was stabbed by a homicidal
 nut job that you brought round to my house.'</p>

<p>'I didn't bring him round.'</p>

<p>'And thirdly,' Roger Yates continued, pointing his
 fingers at Delaney, 'I have to take care of your
 daughter, because her father is a drink-sodden car
 crash of a man with the social responsibility of a
 mentally damaged animal.'</p>

<p>Delaney fought the urge to punch him. 'I do feel
 responsible.'</p>

<p>'You bloody well should do.'</p>

<p>'And I am grateful.'</p>

<p>'As I told you before, Jack. Many times. You can
 show that gratitude by keeping out of my sight.'</p>

<p>'I need a favour.'</p>

<p>Roger sat back in his chair, genuinely astonished.
 'You are bloody joking?'</p>

<p>Delaney pulled out a piece of paper with an
 address written on it and put it on the desk in front
 of him.</p>

<p>'I want to know who owns this building, who built
 it and who sold it. I want the financial trail.'</p>

<p>'And you can't do this through your own
 department, why?'</p>

<p>'Because it's linked to Sinead's death. The people
 responsible for your sister-in-law's murder.'</p>

<p>Roger looked at the paper but made no move to
 pick it up. 'I don't think so.'</p>

<p>Delaney looked at him for a moment. 'You want
 me to tell Wendy you refused to help?'</p>

<p>Roger glared at him for a moment before snatching
 the paper up. 'Get the hell out of my office.'</p>

<p>Delaney glared back at him for a moment then
 nodded, turned his back and walked out the room,
 closing the door loudly behind him. Roger Yates
 simmered with fury for a moment then picked a golf
 ball off his desk and hurled it against the opposite
 wall, narrowly missing a Chagall which was worth
 more than Delaney's annual salary. He looked at the
 address written on the piece of paper then snatched
 up his telephone and punched a button.</p>

<p>'Sarah, I've got a job for you.' He sighed angrily.
 'Well, cancel it. This is urgent. My office, now.'</p>

<p>He slammed the phone down. 'Fucking Irishman!'</p>

<p>Helen Archer sat down in a chair which she had
 carefully placed opposite the sofa where Kate was
 sitting, took a sip of her tea and looked at her visitor
 with puzzled eyes. 'I don't see why we need to talk
 about him. The court case is in a couple of days.'</p>

<p>'I know.'</p>

<p>'And you're with the police, you say?'</p>

<p>Kate shook her head. 'I work with the police. I'm a
 doctor.'</p>

<p>'You're a police surgeon?'</p>

<p>'I used to be. Not any more. I'm a forensic
 pathologist.'</p>

<p>The frown on Helen's forehead deepened. 'I don't
 understand. Has somebody died?'</p>

<p>Kate took a deep breath. 'I think your husband
 might have raped me.'</p>

<p>Helen looked at her, shocked. 'What do you mean
 <emphasis>you think</emphasis> he might have raped you?'</p>

<p>Kate shrugged, blinking back tears. 'I think there
 were drugs involved.' She wiped the back of her hand
 across her eyes. 'A date-rape drug. Rohypnol,
 something like that . . .' She paused for a moment.
 'Like he used with you.'</p>

<p>Helen flinched. 'How do you know that?'</p>

<p>'Like I said, I work with the police,' Kate said. 'I
 looked at documents. I shouldn't have done, but
 I needed to know about him. I needed to know if it
 was true.'</p>

<p>Helen stiffened, lifting her chin, challenging. 'Is
 that why you came here? To see if I was telling the
 truth.'</p>

<p>'Not that. To see if it really happened with me.
 I want to know about him.'</p>

<p>'You want to know about Paul?'</p>

<p>'I'm sorry.'</p>

<p>Helen Archer sighed, her fingers clutching her ring,
 the knuckles white. She took a deep breath. 'Don't be
 sorry,' she said finally. 'None of this is your fault.'</p>

<p>'I'm still sorry. You have enough to deal with.'</p>

<p>'I know what it's like to not be believed. To have a
 man rape you and others believe him when he denies
 it. I know what it's like to be attacked. To be
 attacked by a man you trusted, who you once loved.'
 Helen blinked back tears now. 'I know what it's like
 to be hurt.'</p>

<p>Kate bit her lower lip, not noticing the pain, and
 said again, 'I'm sorry.'</p>

<p>Helen came across and sat beside her on the sofa.
 'It's not your fault,' she said, taking Kate's small, cold
 hand in her own. And Kate cried now, the tears
 running down her cheeks.</p>

<p>The curly-haired man leaned back against the wall
 and looked with disdain across the road where a
 group of office workers had gathered for a cigarette.
 The smokers' room was now al fresco by law after
 all. He had never been a smoker. He had tried it once,
 buying a pack of ten Camels off a boy at school when
 he was twelve years old. He had only smoked one of
 them and hadn't cared for it at all, never felt the urge
 to smoke again. In his book it was a sign of weakness.
 He looked at his watch. One o'clock. He slipped
 headphone buds into his ears, turned on his portable
 radio and listened to the headlines he had been
 waiting for.</p>

<p>A few minutes later he turned it off again. The
 fools still hadn't made the connection. A small
 mention of a woman found dead. Being treated as
 murder but that was it. No mention of the one on
 Hampstead Heath. No mention of what they signified.
 He laughed out loud, quite careless of the
 curious looks he was getting from across the street.
 Idiots the lot of them. Delaney smoked, didn't he?
 Another idiot. He couldn't see a clue if it was served
 up on a silver plate for him.</p>

<p>He looked at his watch once more, started
 whistling a Michael Jackson song and wandered back
 towards his office. In a couple of hours he'd be off
 rota. Then the fun could begin again.</p>

<p>Helen's eyes were like cold flint as she remembered.
 'There was no evidence of any date-rape drug that
 they could find. I got away whilst he was dressing.
 Locked myself in my bedroom and called the police
 from there. But he had plenty of time before they
 arrived to rinse out the decanter. Replace the brandy.
 Clean the carpet where it had spilled.'</p>

<p>'Yes.'</p>

<p>'They took me down the police station. It was
 horrible, Kate. You could see it in the eyes of the
 men. They didn't believe me. My voice was slurred,
 I'd drunk a lot of brandy, laced or otherwise.'</p>

<p>Kate looked at her sympathetically. She knew what
 it was like, she'd drunk far too many vodkas to have
 any control, to have any defences that night. Helen
 was blaming herself for that much at least, and Kate
 could well understand how she felt. The <emphasis>if only</emphasis> that
 changed lives for ever.</p>

<p>'The police surgeon on call was different. She
 believed me. She treated me like the victim I was in
 all this.' Her voice hardened. 'But I'm not going to be
 a victim any more, Kate. I'll see that bastard in court
 and make him pay.'</p>

<p>'I know.'</p>

<p>'And do you know what the worse thing was,
 Kate?'</p>

<p>'Go on.'</p>

<p>'On our fifth wedding anniversary I bought him a
 watch.' The bitterness sharp in her voice. 'A Rolex.
 An eighteen-carat white-gold Rolex Oyster Perpetual
 Cosmograph Daytona. Seventeen thousand pounds'
 worth.'</p>

<p>Kate nodded, not sure what to say.</p>

<p>'A big manly watch for a big manly man. He had
 his arm over my throat and around my head, pinning
 me down, so that the watch scratched my cheek and
 was pushed against my ear. And he was grunting
 with each thrust like an animal, like I was some kind
 of mechanical toy.' Her nostrils flared wide as she
 breathed deeply. 'And I could hear the tick-tock of
 the clock before each thrust. Tick, thrust. Tock,
 thrust. Tick . . .'</p>

<p>She took in another gulp of air and looked at Kate
 with eyes filled with sadness.</p>

<p>'I bought that watch as a symbol of my love for
 him.'</p>

<p>Delaney drummed his fingers impatiently on the
 dashboard of his car as Sally drove them away from
 Roger Yates's office.</p>

<p>'Back to White City, sir?' Sally asked.</p>

<p>'Not just yet. Take us back to Bradley's flat. I want
 to look at those photos again.'</p>

<p>'Sir.'</p>

<p>'If they let us that is. This will have been bumped
 over our heads.'</p>

<p>'What do you mean?'</p>

<p>'If he's a serial killer now the glory boys from
 Paddington Green will be all over this like a rash.'</p>

<p>He pulled out his phone and pushed a speed-dial
 button, putting it on loudspeaker as he rummaged in
 his pockets. 'Slimline, it's Jack Delaney.'</p>

<p>'Shoot.'</p>

<p>'I need a favour.'</p>

<p>'This the kind of favour that might cost someone
 his job?'</p>

<p>'Probably not.'</p>

<p>Delaney could hear him sighing on the other end of
 the line.</p>

<p>'Go on then.'</p>

<p>'I want you to get one of the guys to triangulate a
 number, locate a mobile phone for me. But keep it off
 the books.'</p>

<p>'Whose phone is it?'</p>

<p>'Just get me the location, Dave.'</p>

<p>'Give me the number then.'</p>

<p>Delaney pulled out a piece of paper and read the
 number to him, then closed the phone. Sally looked
 across at him but didn't say anything.</p>

<p>The SOCO team was leaving as Sally and Delaney
 walked up the steps to Bradley's flat. His grandmother
 was watching them go, less than pleased.</p>

<p>She recognised Delaney and grabbed his arm.</p>

<p>'Here. Can't you do anything about them? You
 should see the mess they're making.'</p>

<p>'Sorry. Nothing I can do.'</p>

<p>'They won't let me back in my own house. And I've
 got <emphasis>Murder She Wrote</emphasis> to watch in a minute.'</p>

<p>'Sorry.'</p>

<p>Delaney gently took her hand off his arm as a
 uniformed female officer came across.</p>

<p>'They say I've got to go down the police station,
 Detective Inspector. What's he done now then?'</p>

<p>'They'll tell you all about it there.'</p>

<p>'I told them they should never have got that dog.
 Twelve years old he was when he bit him. Right in
 the privates.' She shivered and shook her head.
 'Made a terrible mess it did.'</p>

<p>'Come on, Mrs Bradley. I'll make sure they get you
 a nice cup of tea,' the uniformed officer said as she
 led the old woman away.</p>

<p>Delaney looked at the photos in Ashley Bradley's
 room. They'd all be taken down, sent to the command
 centre that would now be running the case.
 Everything Delaney wanted to do would have to go
 through them, which made him practically redundant.
 Only Delaney didn't want to be off the case.
 The killer had made it personal, dressing the last
 victim in a scarf like Kate's. Or maybe it <emphasis>was</emphasis> Kate's.
 The idea that the bastard might have her somewhere
 and be taunting him with the knowledge turned his
 stomach. He had called her office and had been told
 that Kate had called in, saying she wouldn't be in
 until later that day, but that could have been done
 under duress. The damn woman wasn't answering
 her phone and Delaney had no way of knowing if it
 was deliberate or not.</p>

<p>He brought his mind back to the subject in hand
 and tapped a few of the photos. 'A lot of these
 interior pictures are taken in the same place. He
 obviously has his favoured hunting grounds like
 South Hampstead Heath and the common.' He
 tapped another photo, an interior shot this time.
 'And I reckon I know where this is.'</p>

<p>Sally looked at where he was pointing. 'Where,
 sir?'</p>

<p>'That shopping arcade at the bottom of
 Bayswater.'</p>

<p>'Whiteleys?'</p>

<p>'That's the one.' Delaney tapped on another photo.
 'Look at him, he's hanging around the entrance to the
 ladies' toilet there.'</p>

<p>'Why?'</p>

<p>Delaney looked back at her. 'Why? Because he's a
 sick fucking pervert. Come on.'</p>

<p>They were heading for the front door when
 Delaney's phone rang. He snatched it out of his
 pocket and looked at the caller ID. 'What have you
 got for me?'</p>

<p>He grabbed a pen out of his pocket and wrote an
 address on the back of his hand. 'One other thing,
 Dave. Get Bob Wilkinson and some backup to get
 down Whiteleys in Bayswater. It looks like a
 favourite hangout for our boy. Second floor near the
 ladies' toilets.' He closed his phone and reached into
 his pocket.</p>

<p>'Give me the car keys, Sally.'</p>

<p>'Sir?'</p>

<p>'Just give me the keys.' He took the keys from her
 and thrust a ten-pound note in her hand. 'I'll see you
 back at the factory.'</p>

<p>Sally would have responded but Delaney was
 already flying down the steps taking them two at a
 time.</p>

<p>*</p>

<p>Kate held Helen Archer's hand for a moment as she
 stood on her doorstep. 'I'll be there at the trial.'</p>

<p>Helen squeezed her hand back. 'Thanks, Kate.
 Don't worry. He's going to pay for what he's done to
 us. He's going to pay big time.'</p>

<p>Kate stood for a moment or two on the step after
 the door had been closed. Troubled. Little flashes of
 memory were coming unbidden into her
 consciousness. It was something Helen had said.
 'He's going to pay big time.' She was in her lounge,
 drunk. There was music playing. Some country folk
 record. Alison Krauss maybe. She'd bought it because
 she thought Jack Delaney might like it. But she had
 never gotten the chance to play it to him.</p>

<p><emphasis>'Here you are, you. Alison bloody Krauss and
 the</emphasis> . . .<emphasis>' Her words slurred slightly and she took
 a moment to steady herself. 'Alison Krauss and
 the Union Station. You ever heard of them?' She
 turned round to the man in her living room. A
 tall man with dark curly hair who she had only
 just met. She must have invited him back, but
 she couldn't remember doing it.</emphasis></p>

<p><emphasis>'Can't say I have,' Paul Archer said.</emphasis></p>

<p><emphasis>'Well, here she is.' She pushed play on her CD
 player and music filled the room. Fiddles and
 guitars. She walked over to the sideboard and
 poured herself a large glass of Scotch. 'Join me.'</emphasis></p>

<p><emphasis>The man shook his head. 'Mixing vodka and
 whisky?'</emphasis></p>

<p><emphasis>Kate beamed and took a big swallow of it. 'Ish
 a cocktail.'</emphasis></p>

<p><emphasis>Archer smiled back at her. 'You're going to
 pay for that in the morning. Pay for it big time.'</emphasis></p>

<p>Kate put her hand on Helen Archer's door to
 steady herself. She must have invited him back. What
 else was there that she couldn't remember? She
 turned around and almost fell back against the door
 with shock.</p>

<p>'What the hell are you doing?'</p>

<p>'I need to speak to you.'</p>

<p>'No.' She shook her head and tried to push past.
 'I've got nothing to say to you.'</p>

<p>But he held her arm, and she had to look up at him
 again. At the dark curly hair and the dark brown
 eyes. But in those eyes she didn't see scorn or hate or
 self-importance. She saw hurt, pain and concern.
 Enough to break her heart. She stopped struggling,
 all resistance gone, the bones in her body like soft
 fabric.</p>

<p>'What do you want, Jack?'</p>

<p>'We need to talk.'</p>

<p>Heavy drops of rain splashed onto the windscreen of
 his car and Delaney turned the ignition a notch and
 flicked his wipers on, but made no move to start his
 engine.</p>

<p>Next to him, Kate sighed and pulled her coat
 tighter to herself, as if cashmere and wool could
 protect her from her emotions. 'What do you want to
 say, Jack? I haven't got the energy for an argument.'</p>

<p>'I know. And I'm sorry. I've been trying to get hold
 of you all morning.'</p>

<p>'How did you know where I was?'</p>

<p>'I got the boys to triangulate your mobile.'</p>

<p>'Is that legal?'</p>

<p>'I needed to speak to you.'</p>

<p>'And it couldn't have waited?'</p>

<p>'I thought you were dead, Kate.'</p>

<p>Kate looked over at him, shocked. 'What are you
 talking about?'</p>

<p>'There was another murder. Another bad one.
 Mutilation . . .' He shook his head at the memory.
 'We think it's the same man.'</p>

<p>'What's that got to do with me? I've given my
 notice in, you know.'</p>

<p>Delaney took her gloved hands and held them
 tight. 'No, I didn't know. But she was wearing your
 scarf, Kate. The victim. It was either yours or one
 exactly the same. It was deliberate.'</p>

<p>'And you thought it was me, you thought the
 victim was me?'</p>

<p>Delaney nodded. 'For a moment. And what he did
 to her . . .'</p>

<p>Kate sat there for a moment, letting him hold her
 hands as she took it all in.</p>

<p>'I don't want to lose you again, Kate.'</p>

<p>She felt the tiny pinpricks in her eyes again. God,
 but the man's timing was bloody excellent. She
 finally collected her thoughts and squeezed his hands
 back.</p>

<p>'You're right. We do need to talk. But not here.
 Not now. There are things we need to take care of
 first. Things I need to do.'</p>

<p>'I've been all kinds of fool, Kate. I won't deny that.
 But it stops here for me, it stops right now.'</p>

<p>Kate nodded, unable to meet his eyes. She knew if
 she did kiss him, then all control on the train wreck
 of her life would be lost for ever. She took her hands
 out of his clasp. 'Take me home first, Jack.'</p>

<p>'It might not be safe.'</p>

<p>'I need to see if my scarf is there.'</p>

<p>Delaney hesitated for a moment and then fired the
 engine up and pulled the car away from the kerb.
 Kate stole a sideways glance at him and saw
 something she wasn't sure she had seen before in his
 eyes. She couldn't be certain, but it looked something
 like hope.</p>

<p>The busker, in tie-dyed jeans and a floral shirt, sitting
 near the bottom of the stairs had a small, portable
 amplifier to boost his voice and the sound of his
 guitar to echo around the mall. He flicked his long,
 braided hair and started singing. A John Lennon
 song. Ashley Bradley scowled as the music started up,
 he was never a fan of the Beatles. Any of them. Smug
 bastards in stupid suits, you asked him.</p>

<p>He flexed his knees a little bit more and held the
 bag he was carrying a little lower. At the bottom of
 the bag was a hole, and through the hole, pointing
 upwards, protruded the lens of a video camcorder.
 Just a little hole, which was great, because camcorders
 could be really small now and it made his job
 a lot easier. The one thing in the world that Ashley
 Bradley was truly grateful for, apart from stretch
 fabric, was technology. Technology was a marvellous
 thing. It gave him the Internet and it gave him the
 camcorder, with the built-in hard drive, which he was
 now positioning under the skirt of the young lady in
 front of him on the escalator. He liked to imagine
 what colour panties she was wearing, not that he
 really minded. Others did, of course, some of the
 guys he swapped files with on the web were very
 specific. Had to be white and cotton or no deal. Or
 leather. Or a thong. But for Ashley, the colour of
 them didn't matter at all, because it meant he had
 lucked out. Ashley Bradley was a commando hunter.
 But they were rare. And part of the thrill for him was
 the anticipation. He wouldn't know if he had bagged
 one until he got home and downloaded what he had
 shot so he could see it on the computer screen. And it
 had been some weeks since he had a result. He had a
 real good feeling about the woman in front of him.
 She looked like butter wouldn't melt, and in his
 experience they were the worst. He'd have loved to
 have had a rummage through her drawers, he
 reckoned he'd find all kind of toys.</p>

<p>He could feel the escalator begin to flatten out
 which snapped him out of his reverie; he moved the
 bag back towards him, looked up and saw two
 uniformed policemen at the top of the stairs staring
 straight at him. He turned around and began running
 down the stairs, pushing people out of the way but
 not getting very far. He leapt over the side of the
 escalator on to the steps travelling downwards and
 began running down them as the two policemen
 above him gave chase. At the bottom he clattered into
 a group of foreign-looking nuns, and after he had
 pushed them aside, the young black copper was
 nearly on him. He darted left and was putting his
 foot down but hadn't seen the busker who was sitting
 on the floor, tripped right over him, smashing his
 guitar into the ground and splintering the wood. The
 busker's shocked, amplified voice filled the shopping
 centre.</p>

<p>'You broke my fucking guitar!'</p>

<p>Danny Vine and Bob Wilkinson, who arrived a
 little later, had to drag Bradley bodily away to save
 him from being strangled by the outraged New Age
 hippy. 'Fucking muppet! I'll fucking kill you!'</p>

<p>Kate sensed as soon as she entered her house that
 something was wrong. She walked down the hallway
 to the kitchen. She looked at the hooks hanging on
 the back of the kitchen door and shook her head. 'It's
 not here, Jack. What the hell's going on?'</p>

<p>Delaney shrugged. 'I don't know. But I'm going to
 find out.'</p>

<p>Kate shook her head. 'No, <emphasis>we're</emphasis> going to find out.
 Who was attending at the scene from my office?'</p>

<p>'Patrick Neally.'</p>

<p>Delaney's phone rang, echoing loudly in the stone-flagged
 kitchen as he pulled it from his pocket.
 'Delaney.'</p>

<p>'It's Bob Wilkinson.'</p>

<p>'Go on, Bob.'</p>

<p>'You might want to get down the nick.'</p>

<p>'You got him?'</p>

<p>'Yeah, you were on the money. But I'd get down
 here quick if I were you. The shiny boys from serious
 crime are all over him.'</p>

<p>'We're on our way.'</p>

<p>Delaney put his hand on Kate's arm and steered
 her out. If she felt displeasure at his touch she didn't
 display it. 'Who have they got?' she asked.</p>

<p>'Ashley Bradley.'</p>

<p>'He's the killer?'</p>

<p>'He had pictures of both victims on his walls and
 he's a class-A pervert, we know that.'</p>

<p>'Why the bloody hell would he take my scarf
 though?'</p>

<p>Delaney fished his car keys out as Kate locked her
 front door behind her. 'I don't know, Kate.'</p>

<p>But he had an idea.</p>

<p>Ashley Bradley sat uncomfortably on the hard,
 plastic chair. The central ridge cut into him painfully.
 He wasn't wearing underpants, he never did when he
 went out on a mission, but he now wished that he
 had been. He shifted again and adjusted himself.</p>

<p>Delaney watched, through the one-way mirror, as
 the suit- and tie-wearing finest from the serious crime
 squad interviewed him. He flicked the switch so he
 could hear the words.</p>

<p>'You want to tell us about the photos on the walls
 of your bedroom?'</p>

<p>'It's not a crime.'</p>

<p>'Yes it is, Ashley.'</p>

<p>'No it's not. It's perfectly legal to take pictures of
 people in public places.'</p>

<p>Delaney was amazed, as ever, at the calm
 arrogance of degenerates caught right in the act.
 People who looked at child pornography were only
 doing it for research. Convicted child abusers claimed
 it was a form of love as ancient as humanity. Delaney
 would have liked to have gone into the room and
 given Ashley Bradley some tough love right then. The
 kind that draws blood.</p>

<p>His mobile phone rang and Delaney, seeing the ID,
 flicked the switch off on the intercom.</p>

<p>'What have you got for me, Roger?'</p>

<p>'The properties in Pinner Green. A development
 company was set up to buy out the existing
 businesses there and convert them to luxury apartments.
 Took about a year to set up. The petrol
 station, independently owned, was the last to be sold.
 Given the time of the development and the time the
 last of the luxury apartments were sold at the height
 of the market two years ago . . .'</p>

<p>'Go on.'</p>

<p>'We're looking at millions of pounds' worth of
 profit.'</p>

<p>'And who owned the development company?'</p>

<p>'An outfit called Blue Heaven Property.'</p>

<p>'And who owns that?'</p>

<p>'It was just set up for this venture. But it links to a
 shell company called Hunter Developments.'</p>

<p>Delaney sighed. 'Get to the point, Roger.'</p>

<p>'That's just it, Hunter Developments, like I say, is
 a shell company. The trail leads offshore. Financed
 out of the Cayman Islands.'</p>

<p>'And what does that mean?'</p>

<p>'It means we don't know who owns the development
 company.'</p>

<p>'And there's no way of finding out?'</p>

<p>'None that I'm capable of.'</p>

<p>'How then?'</p>

<p>'I don't know, Jack. These guys are probably
 operating outside the law. This is your area of
 expertise. You deal with it.'</p>

<p>The line went dead. Delaney closed his phone and
 cursed. He may not know who was behind what
 happened, yet. But at least now he had motive and
 that was a start. He flicked the intercom switch on
 and listened to Ashley Bradley flatly denying any
 involvement in the murders. As he watched him, and
 listened to him speak, Delaney thought he was an
 unlikely candidate for a serial killer. But then he was
 also aware that they didn't always hunt alone. Yes,
 sometimes they had an accomplice, someone who
 had graduated up from flashing at cantankerous
 nurses and filming the undergarments of unwary
 shoppers at shopping malls. But, if the smart-suited
 and career-enhanced coppers interviewing the
 suspect had asked for his opinion, he would have
 said that Ashley Bradley wasn't involved at all.
 He could read people, that was his talent above all
 else. And, although he had thought, when he first
 saw the photos Bradley had on his wall, that he had
 made a big mistake in letting him pass them on the
 stairs, listening to him now he didn't think he had.
 They had the wrong man. He'd put money on it.</p>

<p>Upstairs, Kate Walker was sitting in Jack Delaney's
 office, at his desk, and drinking a cup of coffee from
 his mug. If someone had told her this morning she
 would be doing that she would have thought them
 mad. At the moment though she didn't have time for
 introspection. She was looking at the preliminary
 report from Dr Patrick Neally, her colleague who had
 attended the murder scene earlier that day. She had
 asked her assistant to email it through. Strictly
 speaking she should have gone to him first, but she
 didn't have the time for professional niceties. And, in
 any case, she was working out her notice, so she
 thought, stuff it! She also had the photographs and
 notes from the scene of crime, which she was leaving
 till last. The report didn't make for good reading.
 Whoever had done this to another person was
 beyond reason. The mutilation was sickening even to
 her, who had seen enough horror over her years as a
 forensic pathologist to despair of the human race
 entirely. This was a degree of magnitude more
 gruesome than anything she had ever seen.</p>

<p>But it was to get worse.</p>

<p>Delaney was walking down the front staircase, heading
 for the exit to the car park. He needed a cigarette.
 Actually he needed a drink. Not needed it, he
 rationalised, but wanted it. When did want become
 need? he wondered. When you had no control over
 your desires? Well, that was something he always
 had. Not like the sad bastard being interviewed right
 now.</p>

<p>What Delaney needed to do was think, and the
 quick spikes of nicotine in his blood helped him do
 that. He was fumbling in the right-hand pocket of his
 leather jacket for his cigarettes when George Napier
 walked up to him, a smile on his face, Diane
 Campbell right behind him, not smiling at all.</p>

<p>'Delaney.'</p>

<p>Delaney's heart sank. Napier smiling. Not a good
 sign. 'Guv.' He nodded at Diane, who raised her
 eyebrows back. 'Ma'am.'</p>

<p>'Good work today, Delaney. Nipped him in the
 bud.'</p>

<p>'Sir?'</p>

<p>'Bradley.'</p>

<p>'I don't think we should get ahead of ourselves, sir.'</p>

<p>'Now is not the time to piss on your own parade,
 Delaney.'</p>

<p>'I'm sorry?'</p>

<p>'We have a press conference set up. We want you
 to make the statement.'</p>

<p>'Aren't we jumping the gun a little?'</p>

<p>'Not at all. The press are going to be all over the
 serial killer aspect. Sky News have held off until now,
 but as we have the perpetrator in custody they have
 asked for first bite of the cherry.'</p>

<p>'How did they know we have someone in custody?'</p>

<p>'Are you deliberately being obtuse, man?'</p>

<p>Delaney smiled at Diane. 'Must be my Irish
 upbringing, sir.'</p>

<p>'I've been in contact with her to control what goes
 on the news. We made a deal. I, for one, honour my
 deals.'</p>

<p>'And if he's not the killer?'</p>

<p>'Of course he's the killer. He's got pictures of the
 two women hanging on his wall, and we have him
 exposing himself on the heath right by one of dead
 victims.'</p>

<p>'All we have him for, sir, with respect, is just that.
 Flashing his johnson at medical workers and sticking
 his zoom lens up the skirts of happy shoppers.'
 Delaney turned to his line boss. 'Can you talk some
 sense into the man?'</p>

<p>'Maybe we should let Delaney interview him first,
 sir,' she said quickly.</p>

<p>Napier goggled at her. 'And while he's doing that,
 Paddington Green take the credit for our collar? I
 don't think so.'</p>

<p>He looked at his watch. 'We're set up outside.'</p>

<p>Delaney shrugged and put a cigarette in his mouth.
 Napier snatched it out and handed it to Diane
 Campbell. 'Can't you keep a bloody leash on him,
 Diane?'</p>

<p>'He needs castrating, sir, if you ask me. But I trust
 his instincts.'</p>

<p>Napier thrust a sheet of paper into Delaney's
 hands. 'Just smile at the pretty reporter and read the
 statement, Delaney. Think you can manage that?'</p>

<p>'Not sure, sir. Not one for multitasking. Maybe the
 chief inspector should do it.'</p>

<p>'And maybe I should remind you that there is a
 complaint against you, Delaney?'</p>

<p>'And I'm sure Detective Constable Cartwright will
 tell you that I merely defended myself.'</p>

<p>'Just play ball with me, Delaney. And I'll play ball
 with you. This is a team here, and what counts is we
 get results. You clear on that?'</p>

<p>'Sir.'</p>

<p>He thrust the sheet of paper into Delaney's hands.
 'Then put one on the scoreboard for White City and
 read the bloody statement.'</p>

<p>In the CID room, Jimmy Skinner called for hush,
 even though nobody was talking and turned the
 volume up on the television mounted on the wall. Sky
 News was playing, with the breaking news banner
 ticker-taping along the bottom – <emphasis>man arrested in
 connection with two recent murders</emphasis>. Delaney was
 facing the camera, looking as happy to be there as a
 pig in a pork-pie shop. The camera cut back to
 Melanie Jones who had her serious face on.</p>

<p>'Detective Inspector Delaney. I understand you
 have been responsible for the arrest of a suspect in
 two particularly gruesome killings. The first on South
 Hampstead Heath yesterday, and the second discovered
 this morning in a rented flat in Camden
 Town?'</p>

<p>'A man is helping us with our inquiries.'</p>

<p>'One man responsible for both murders? So we are
 looking at a serial killer here?'</p>

<p>'If I could just read out the prepared statement?'</p>

<p>'Of course.'</p>

<p>Delaney looked at the camera. ' "We can confirm
 that a man has been arrested this afternoon and is
 being questioned here at White City police station in
 relation to the unlawful killings of two women. These
 women have not as yet been identified and we would
 urge anyone who knows them to contact the police as
 soon as possible." '</p>

<p>The pictures taken from Ashley Bradley's bedroom
 wall of the two dead women flashed up on the
 television screen.</p>

<p>In the CID room Kate looked at the photographs
 as they appeared on the screen. She couldn't see why
 Jack Delaney had thought that one of them was her.
 But with a wig on, and wearing her scarf, perhaps it
 was an easy mistake to make. The women in the
 photos looked young, confident and full of life. She
 hadn't as yet looked at the scene-of-crime photos
 from the Camden flat. She looked at the screen as the
 camera shot cut back to Melanie Jones.</p>

<p>'What can you tell us about the man in custody,
 Detective Inspector?'</p>

<p>Delaney looked down at the piece of paper that his
 boss had given him. There was no more to the statement
 and he had been told not to answer any
 questions.</p>

<p>'There is nothing I can add to my statement about
 the man in custody. However, we do believe that the
 man responsible for these crimes has very low self-esteem.
 He also has an uncontrollable anger towards
 women and we think this is down to a very serious
 form of penis envy.'</p>

<p>Melanie Jones reacted, smiled a little as she
 recovered herself. 'I beg your pardon?'</p>

<p>Delaney looked at her, deadpan. 'We believe that
 he feels himself to be extremely inadequate in the eyes
 of women, and that this is down to some kind of
 genital deformity.'</p>

<p>Behind the camera Delaney could see that George
 Napier was absolutely fuming. He'd better watch his
 stress levels, he thought, he was a heart attack looking
 to happen. He could see Melanie Jones was about
 to ask another question but he held his hand up.</p>

<p>'I am sorry but that is all the information I am able
 to give at this juncture. Once again, I would urge
 anyone who has any information about these women
 to come forward.'</p>

<p>The images of the two women appeared on the
 television screen once more.</p>

<p>Delaney headed back to the building. Napier
 would have followed after him but Melanie Jones
 approached him and he stopped to try and fight some
 of the forest fire Delaney had started.</p>

<p>In the CID office Jimmy Skinner grinned at the television
 screen. 'Way to go, Jack.' He winked at Sally
 Cartwright. 'Looks like you might need a new partner.'</p>

<p>Kate looked across at him. 'I'm assuming he made
 all that up?'</p>

<p>'The bit about the deformed wing-wang? I doubt
 that was in the script.'</p>

<p>'Why did he say it then?'</p>

<p>'The killer is fucking around with Delaney.
 Sending him messages. I guess he thought he would
 send one back.'</p>

<p>'Is that wise?'</p>

<p>Skinner laughed out loud. 'Wise? This is Jack
 Delaney we're talking about. He's not famous for
 having the wisdom of Solomon.'</p>

<p>Delaney gave the custody sergeant a quick, grateful
 nod as he opened the door to the holding cell. He
 stepped inside and the sergeant closed it behind him.
 He looked down at Ashley Bradley who was sitting
 on the bed holding his head in his hands.</p>

<p>'You got anything to tell me, Ashley?'</p>

<p>'Who are you?</p>

<p>'I'm the sugarplum fucking fairy. Now answer my
 question.'</p>

<p>Ashley Bradley shook his head nervously. 'I have
 no idea what you're talking about.'</p>

<p>'You don't know who I am?'</p>

<p>Bradley shrugged.</p>

<p>'I'm Jack Delaney. Detective Inspector Delaney.
 That make matters clearer for you?'</p>

<p>'You've come to let me out?'</p>

<p>Delaney barked a short, humourless laugh. 'Now
 why in the name of all that's fucking holy would you
 think that?'</p>

<p>'Because I haven't done anything wrong.'</p>

<p>'We caught you filming up the skirt of some
 woman with no knickers on, you twink.'</p>

<p>Bradley sat up, more animated now. 'Are you
 saying she wasn't wearing anything?'</p>

<p>Delaney sighed. 'You want to stick with the
 programme here, son.'</p>

<p>'I want that tape back. That's my property. It's
 legal to film people in public places, I looked it up on
 the Internet.'</p>

<p>Delaney glared at him, his voice ratcheting up a
 few decibels. 'Up her fucking skirt isn't considered
 a public place, you sick dipstick.'</p>

<p>He crossed over to Ashley who flinched back
 against the wall. 'What the hell is the mirror and the
 buckle about?'</p>

<p>Bradley shook his head. 'I don't know what you're
 talking about.'</p>

<p>Delaney looked in his eyes. Could see the fear and
 the confusion, but couldn't see any guile. In truth, he
 hadn't expected to. He turned back to the door and
 rapped on it for the custody sergeant to let him out.</p>

<p>'Wait a minute.'</p>

<p>Delaney could hear the desperation in his voice and
 turned back half hopeful. 'Yes?'</p>

<p>'About that tape . . .'</p>

<p>'What about it?'</p>

<p>'If you could get it back for me, I'd make it worth
 your while.'</p>

<p>Delaney slammed the door on him.</p>

<p>The curly-haired man was sitting at his usual table in
 the White Horse again. Nursing a pint of Guinness.
 He took a sip and spilled some as he put the glass
 back down on the table, his hand was shaking so
 much with anger. The barman picked up the remote
 control and changed the channel from Sky News to
 Sky Sports.</p>

<p>He took another sip of his pint. The Irish beer
 was far too bitter for his taste but he drank it
 anyway. That clown Delaney had just made a big
 mistake. He was helping the guy after all. And, all
 right, he might have teased him a little with a
 practical joke. But he'd been helping him. Leaving
 him clues. Getting that retroussé-nosed reporter to
 put her candy-coloured lips to good use. Delaney
 should have been orgasming by now. He should
 have been coming in his fucking detective trousers
 for the help he was giving to him and his career.
 Instead he was dicking about on national television.
 Deformed genitalia! He'd give him deformed
 genitalia. He looked at the woman who was standing
 at the bar sipping on a bottle of Gold Label. Her
 thin shoulder showed bone, but her arms had
 muscle on them, like a female javelin thrower, with
 just as strong a grip. In her thirties with ancient eyes
 and buttocks that had been kissed by more bricks
 than a stonemason's trowel, he reckoned. He
 watched as she took another gulp of her Gold Label.
 Strong barley wine, proof against the elements.
 Probably proof against any leakage in her mouth
 from a poorly fitting condom too, he thought. Gold
 Label, it was like Domestos, killed ninety-nine point
 nine per cent of all germs dead.</p>

<p>He could relate to that.</p>

<p>Detective Inspector Jack Delaney was a germ.</p>

<p>*</p>

<p>Kate hesitated for a moment before opening the envelope
 containing the scene-of-crime photographs.
 Something Jack had said niggled at her. There was
 something she was sure they ought to be seeing, something
 right before their eyes. She opened the envelope
 and spilled the black-and-white photographs on to her
 desk. One slid to the back of the desk. She picked it up.
 It was a close-up of part of the woman's neck and it
 showed the same deep puncture wound as the first
 victim had.</p>

<p>She picked up the phone and dialled her own work
 number. When her assistant answered, she asked if
 the blood-work report was in. She listened, making
 some notes as she did so. There were high levels of
 tranquilliser in the first victim's blood, and she'd bet
 her mortgage that the second victim's blood work
 would show the same.</p>

<p>She thanked her assistant, told her not to make any
 appointments and hung up the phone. She sorted
 through the other photos and looked at them,
 shuddering to see her own scarf hung about the
 throat of the mutilated woman like some kind of
 macabre decoration. She looked at the next photo, a
 close-up of the victim's right hand which was holding
 a small, broken mirror.</p>

<p>She looked at the report again. It was the sort
 of compact mirror you might find in a handbag.
 And it was broken. Suddenly her synapses started
 firing like fireworks on Guy Fawkes Night and she
 put the pieces together. She remembered what Jack
 had said and she looked at the second photo once
 more, the woman laid out, posed for the camera,
 with her scarf as a final flourish. And she
 remembered.</p>

<p>'Sweet Jesus!'</p>

<p>Delaney was heading towards his office. The newscast
 had generated hundreds of calls, people phoning
 in claiming to know the identity of one of the dead
 women, and each one had to be checked out. It
 wasn't what Napier had in mind but maybe some
 good had come out of the news piece after all. He had
 his hand on the office door when his mobile phone
 rang. He looked at the caller ID but didn't recognise
 the number. 'Jack Delaney.'</p>

<p>'Jack, it's me.'</p>

<p>Delaney didn't need to ask. He could hear the lazy,
 hypnotic lilt to her accent. He remembered it as a
 voice filled with mischief, with amusement. But
 today, her voice was as serious as a heart attack.'</p>

<p>'What do you want, Stella?'</p>

<p>'I saw you on the television.'</p>

<p>Delaney sighed. 'I'm a little bit busy here.'</p>

<p>'One of those women. I know her. She's in the life,
 cowboy. At least, she was.'</p>

<p>Jack didn't even stop to consider the irony of the
 expression. 'Who is she, Stella?'</p>

<p>The lightning cracked through the air like a jagged
 spear. Moments after the thunder rumbled overhead
 and the rain started in earnest, splattering against the
 window like a hailstorm. Kate looked at her watch, it
 was only five o'clock.</p>

<p>She pushed the print icon on Jack's computer and
 watched as the sheets began to spill from his printer.
 A couple of desks down Sally looked up from her
 computer monitor and saw her expression.</p>

<p>'Something wrong?</p>

<p>'Yeah, Sally. Something's very wrong.'</p>

<p>Delaney pushed the door of the CID room open
 with the flat of his hand.</p>

<p>'The second victim's name is Jennifer Cole. She
 was an escort. High-class call girl. She had her
 own website.' He pulled a chair out and sat next to
 Sally. 'Type in London Angel, one word, dot co
 dot uk.'</p>

<p>Kate collected the papers she had printed out and
 walked over to Delaney, as an image appeared on the
 screen. A healthy, sexy, vibrant image of the woman
 who had been butchered like a sacrificial cow.</p>

<p>'You better have a look at this, Jack.' Kate handed
 Delaney the documents she had printed out.</p>

<p>Delaney skimmed his eyes over as he read the
 first page. 'She wasn't missing any teeth. What is
 this?'</p>

<p>Kate took the pages off him and read sections
 aloud. ' "The left arm across the left breast. The
 instrument used at the throat and abdomen was the
 same. It must have been a very sharp knife with a thin
 narrow blade, and must have been at least six to eight
 inches in length, probably longer. He should say that
 the injuries could not have been inflicted by a
 bayonet or a sword bayonet. They could have been
 done by such an instrument as a medical man used
 for post-mortem purposes, but the ordinary surgical
 cases might not contain such an instrument. Those
 used by the slaughtermen, well ground down, might
 have caused them. He thought the knives used by
 those in the leather trade would not be long enough
 in the blade. There were indications of anatomical
 knowledge—" '</p>

<p>'What is this?' Delaney interrupted her.</p>

<p>'It's a report, Jack, but not from our murders.'</p>

<p>'Whose then?'</p>

<p>'They didn't come from my office, I just printed
 them off the Internet. He's been sending you
 messages all along. Start with the man in the mirror,
 Jack! It's your namesake.'</p>

<p>'What is?'</p>

<p>'The scarf instead of a handkerchief. The mirror
 found with the second body. The guy is dressing the
 victims up like Jack the Ripper victims.'</p>

<p>Delaney looked up at her, taking it in. 'He's
 copycatting.'</p>

<p>'Not exactly, no. But . . .' she shrugged.</p>

<p>'How many were there?'</p>

<p>'At least five,' said Sally. 'All prostitutes. Some
 reckon as many as eleven.'</p>

<p>'Jesus!'</p>

<p>The lightning flashed again. The thunder was
 almost simultaneous now; they were right under the
 storm. Delaney looked across at the pane of glass and
 back at Kate. 'You can't be fucking serious.'</p>

<p>'There's another thing,' said Sally.</p>

<p>'Go on.'</p>

<p>'As you know they never found the identity of Jack
 the Ripper.'</p>

<p>'Yeah, of course I know that.'</p>

<p>'One of the suspects, not one of the main ones but
 one of them nonetheless . . .'</p>

<p>'Go on.'</p>

<p>'Walter Sickert.'</p>

<p>'The artist.'</p>

<p>'Some people claimed he was the Ripper himself. A
 lot of people thought he might just have been an
 accessory. An accomplice to the real killer.'</p>

<p>'And?'</p>

<p>'And, Jack . . . He had several operations on his
 penis,' Kate interjected.</p>

<p>'That's right,' said Sally. 'He had what Jimmy
 Skinner would call a deformed wing-wang.'</p>

<p>He leaned his forehead against the pane of glass. He
 hated the rain, but the cool glass seemed to ease the
 heat in his forehead. He looked at his watch, five
 o'clock, but it was already as dark as if it was midwinter.
 He didn't mind the dark. He rubbed his
 hand over the handle of the gun he was holding, the
 wood as warm beneath his touch as the glass was
 cold. The phone rang, jangling him out of his reverie.
 He had been expecting the call. It was time to go to
 work again. There were names on a list. Names that
 had to be crossed out. He cupped one hand
 instinctively on his crotch and felt his cock stiffen as
 he put down the gun and answered the phone with
 the other.</p>

<p>'It's me.'</p>

<p>Delaney watched as Sally flashed the blinking cursor
 around the website. She clicked on a hyperlink titled
 'Double Dates' and read aloud.</p>

<p>'"For some of the more adventurous, or just plain
 greedy, amongst you I also offer a double-date service
 with one of my gorgeous girlfriends. Click on the
 links left to see just how gorgeous. Double the honey
 and double the fun."'</p>

<p>Sally did as she was told, moving the cursor to a
 list of four names on the left-hand side of the screen.
 <emphasis>Crystal, Amber, Melody</emphasis> and <emphasis>Rose</emphasis>.</p>

<p>Crystal was a blonde, Amber was a brunette and
 Melody had black hair. Black skirt, top, and black
 make-up. Goth-style.</p>

<p>Bingo.</p>

<p>James Collins opened his locker door in the changing
 room and yawned as he changed out of his surgical
 scrubs. It had been a long and difficult day. He had
 had to perform an emergency C section on an illegal
 immigrant. A failed asylum seeker from some godforsaken
 country the government was keen to return
 her to. Back to poverty, malnutrition, all manner of
 abuse and, most likely, an early death. With a baby
 born in the UK, however, her status would be
 reconsidered. They had delivered the baby, but it was
 premature and struggling from the start. Two hours
 later and the baby died. The mother came through
 surgery fine, but he could see in her eyes, as she came
 round from the anaesthetic, that something else had
 died that afternoon for her. Hope.</p>

<p>James reached into the back of the locker and
 picked up a small teddy bear, dressed in surgical
 scrubs. His daughter, Amy, had given it to him as a
 good-luck gesture when he moved to the hospital,
 from the North Norfolk and Norwich, eighteen
 months ago. The surgical cap on the teddy bear's
 head was in Norwich City colours. He jiggled it in
 his hand.</p>

<p>'Come on, let's be having you!'</p>

<p>He smiled sadly and put it back in his locker. Took
 out his bright yellow duffel coat and closed the locker
 door. It was Amy's birthday in three days' time. Her
 twenty-first, and he had taken the rest of the week off
 to visit her. It'd give him a chance to get out to the
 shops and buy her something spectacular for it too.
 James Collins was a strict believer that special
 occasions should be marked appropriately. He had
 already made the call to his favourite jeweller in
 Piccadilly and he would visit there first thing in the
 morning before catching the train from Liverpool
 Street to Thorpe station in Norwich. The Canaries
 were playing at home at the weekend too, so he had,
 he sincerely hoped, double cause for celebration.</p>

<p>He sketched a wave at the receptionist as he strode
 through reception. The thunderstorm that had been
 raging only minutes before had stopped as suddenly
 as it began. He paused outside in the sheltered
 entrance and shivered suddenly, looking behind him.
 He thought he sensed someone watching him but
 there was no one there. Someone must have walked
 on his grave, he thought with a half-amused smile.
 He fastened the buttons of his coat and was glad to
 leave the hood of the duffel down as he strode across
 the car park. The cold air and the brisk walk would
 do him good, wake him up a bit.</p>

<p>Five minutes later and he was walking across the
 heath. Cutting through some trees on a little short cut
 that took a few minutes off his journey. He stopped
 abruptly. There was a sharp pain in his neck and he
 raised his hand to brush the stabbing branch away.
 But no branch was there and the muscles in his arm
 suddenly didn't seem to work. His knees buckled,
 toppling him to fall face up on the wet and muddy
 ground. A face he recognised was looking down at
 him.</p>

<p>A look of confusion passed momentarily across
 his face. If he could have articulated a question
 he would have done so. But the paralysis had
 spread to his face now. His eyes closed and the
 pump under his ribcage, made of tissue and muscle,
 spasmed.</p>

<p>A low sound of thunder rumbled overhead again
 and, as the wind picked up whistling wet leaves over
 his motionless form, the rain fell. Sending splashes of
 mud into the air and forming a channel of artificial
 tears from the surgeon's closed eyes.</p>

<p>Delaney pulled his jacket off the back of his chair and
 shrugged into it.</p>

<p>'Did you get that address?' he asked Sally
 Cartwright.</p>

<p>She picked up a piece of paper from her desk and
 handed it to him.</p>

<p>'Thanks.' He stuffed the paper into his jacket
 pocket. 'Get on to records. I want to know if any
 other crimes were reported in the neighbouring
 properties around the same time.'</p>

<p>'Sir.'</p>

<p>Kate stood up also and put on her coat, looking for
 her scarf for a moment and then grimacing as she
 remembered why she no longer had it.</p>

<p>'Where are you going, Kate?'</p>

<p>Kate turned round to Delaney, ready to say
 something flip, but when she saw the concern in his
 eyes the temptation vanished. 'I need to go home.'</p>

<p>'You're not staying at that house. You can stay
 with me.'</p>

<p>Kate hesitated for a moment and then nodded,
 relief coursing through her blood. 'I still need to go
 home, get some things.'</p>

<p>Delaney picked up his car keys off his desk.</p>

<p>'And one other thing, Jack.'</p>

<p>Delaney looked at her quizzically.</p>

<p>'We'll take my car.'</p>

<p>'We have to make a slight detour first.' Delaney
 turned back to Sally as they walked to the door.
 'Keep me in touch.'</p>

<p>'Sir.'</p>

<p>She stuck her thumb up in the air without looking
 at her boss, her attention focused on her computer
 screen, looking at the reports Kate Walker had
 printed out and the crime-scene photographs. She
 wondered whether she'd ever be able to look at
 photos like them and not feel physically sick. She
 fervently hoped not.</p>

<p>Sanjeev Singh was tall but as thin as a Lowry stick
 man. He wore large, black-framed glasses and was
 never dressed in anything other than a two-piece
 brown suit. He had always been of a nervous disposition
 and so why he had put a jangling bell over
 the entrance to his shop was a mystery to anyone
 who knew him.</p>

<p>He flinched as the door creaked open and the brass
 bell above it danced on its coiled brass spring,
 jangling his nerves once more.</p>

<p>'We're about to close,' he called over his shoulder
 as he placed an art deco sugar sifter, conical-shaped
 and decorated in Spring Crocus pattern, carefully
 back in a display cabinet. He put the price page next
 to it: four hundred and fifty pounds.</p>

<p>'Nice piece.'</p>

<p>He turned round and smiled at Kate, but his smile
 faded as Delaney stepped forward.</p>

<p>'We're not here for antiques.'</p>

<p>Sanjeev Singh lifted his arms and made an
 expansive gesture with his shoulders, a gesture he had
 used many times to good effect in the amateur pantomimes
 he had appeared in. 'I am sorry, but antiques
 is all I deal in.'</p>

<p>Delaney showed him his warrant card. 'It's
 information we need.'</p>

<p>Singh frowned. 'I don't understand.'</p>

<p>'Four years ago you sold your petrol station in
 Pinner Green. We want to know why, and we want
 to know who to.'</p>

<p>The antique dealer's shoulders slumped, and any
 pretence at good humour disappeared. 'My lawyers
 handled the sale. It was to a development company. I
 wanted to get out of the trade. Buy an antiques shop.
 The timing was right. Now I am sorry, but I really
 have to close.'</p>

<p>'It wasn't good timing for my wife, Mr Singh.'</p>

<p>Sanjeev Singh looked at Delaney again, recognition
 dawning in his eyes. He gestured with his hands
 again, hands that were suddenly trembling even more
 than was usual.</p>

<p>'Look, I am sorry about what happened to your
 wife. The next day someone made me an offer for the
 place and I accepted it.'</p>

<p>'Why?'</p>

<p>'Why do you think? I don't know who was behind
 it but their methods were pretty clear.'</p>

<p>'Somebody wanted you out?'</p>

<p>'I'd had an offer before but I turned it down. I
 thought that if they were desperate for my property
 they could pay top dollar. But that same week the
 florists next door had an accidental fire. Their dog, a
 Labrador, died in the fire. They sold. And after what
 happened to me, I sold too.'</p>

<p>'Who to?'</p>

<p>The man shrugged again, apologetically. 'I don't
 know. It was all done through a lawyer.'</p>

<p>'Okay.' Delaney gestured to Kate. 'Come on, let's
 get your things.'</p>

<p>Kate held up her hand. 'One minute.' She turned to
 the trembling Indian. 'One more thing.'</p>

<p>Sanjeev clasped his hands together. 'Please, I have
 told you everything I know.'</p>

<p>'What's your best price on the sugar sifter?'</p>

<p>A smile almost came back on his face. 'You have a
 remarkable eye, madam. This here is—'</p>

<p>'Yes, I know,' Kate said, interrupting. 'It's Clarice
 Cliff. What will you take for it?'</p>

<p>Some minutes after they had left, Sanjeev Singh
 finally brought his shaking hands under enough
 control to pick up a telephone.</p>

<p>Kate pulled her car to the side of the road with a
 practised spin of the wheel. She snapped her seat belt
 open and turned to Delaney. 'I won't be long.'</p>

<p>'I'm coming with you, Kate.'</p>

<p>She turned the key to open the front door of her
 house and the first thing that struck her was the cold,
 the wind was blowing from the inside out. The
 second thing was the carnage.</p>

<p>Every room in the maisonette had been turned
 upside down. In the lounge bookcases had been
 toppled to the floor, sofas and chairs upended, CDs
 and records strewn as though a hurricane had blown
 through the place. Her bedroom was equally
 ravaged, and in the kitchen, plates and crockery had
 been smashed, the table legs snapped off, food
 scattered everywhere. Kate was too numb to cry out.
 She looked at Delaney, fury bubbling through her.
 She slammed the open back door shut. 'We have to
 get him, Jack. We have to stop him.'</p>

<p>She began to shake, willing herself to stop but
 unable to get her twitching muscles to comply.</p>

<p>Delaney took two quick steps to her side and
 enveloped her in a hug. 'It's going to be all right,
 Kate. I swear it.'</p>

<p>And Kate, feeling the strength in his arms, feeling
 the passion in his voice, believed him. For the first
 time in years she felt protected. She loved him, she
 knew that now more than ever. He was the first man
 she had ever truly let into her life. He had hurt her,
 but she realised that she had been hurt so deeply
 because she loved him so deeply. She held him as
 though she could bind him to her for ever. Jack
 Delaney was part of her now and she would never let
 him go.</p>

<p>Delaney pulled out his phone. 'Dave, it's Delaney.
 I need to get a couple of units down here. Kate
 Walker's house has been trashed.'</p>

<p>Ten minutes later, Kate put down the small suitcase
 that she had packed, and locked her front door.
 Delaney picked up her suitcase and walked towards
 her car as she fished in her pocket for her car keys.
 She was just thinking that at least the Clarice Cliff
 sugar sifter hadn't been in the house, when a shot
 rang out in the night air like a sudden crack of
 thunder. Kate instinctively looked up at the sky then
 screamed as Delaney rocked on his heels, a surprised
 look on his face, then stumbled and fell sideways to
 crumple on to the cold, wet pavement.</p>

<p>Kate rushed over to him, calling his name, begging
 him to speak. But Delaney was beyond speech; he
 was beyond comprehension. She tried to shield his
 body with her own as she fumbled in her pocket for
 her phone, looking about desperately to see where
 the shot had come from.</p>

<p>'Stay with me, Jack. Stay with me.'</p>

<p>Her voice was no more than a whisper, but it
 echoed in her mind like a thunderous prayer. Before
 her trembling fingers could punch in 999 on her
 phone keypad, the sound of police sirens from the
 squad cars that Delaney had asked for came roaring
 into her street. And she prayed continually as she
 tried to find a pulse. 'Stay with me, Jack. Please stay
 with me.'</p>

<p>He rubbed the soft fabric over the gleaming grip of
 the gun. He had already anointed the wood with
 beeswax and polished it in with an old yellow duster.
 He was just giving the final finish with the superior
 cloth. He rubbed it some more, seeing his reflection
 looking back at him, distorted in the smooth surface
 of the wood. His eyes were widened and smiling.</p>

<p>He held the cloth to his nose and sniffed deeply as
 though it were an oxygen mask. Then he opened it
 out and lay it on the coffee table, like a trophy. It was
 a pair of plain, white cotton panties that he had
 stolen, like the scarf, from Dr Kate Walker's house.</p>

<empty-line /><empty-line /><p><strong>DAY THREE</strong></p>

<p>The rain had stopped sometime in the middle of the
 night. But the ground wasn't cold enough yet to
 freeze, and so the paths that ran through Hampstead
 Heath like veins through a body were slick with wet
 mud and leaves. Gillian Carter, a twenty-seven-year-old
 bookshop assistant, picked her way carefully
 down one of the paths. Not an easy task as the dog
 she had on the other end of the lead, a Briard,
 weighed nearly as much as she did and had the
 energy of a roomful of pre-school children on a diet
 of Red Bull. A bird clattered out of the trees ahead
 and the dog leapt after it. Gillian Carter, faced with
 the choice of losing control of the dog or herself on
 the slippery downward slope, chose the former and
 let the lead fly from her hand.</p>

<p>'Jake!' she called after the dog, but he was focused
 on the bird swirling upwards through the air and
 soon disappeared deep into the bracken. Gillian
 stopped to catch her breath and sighed. It wasn't even
 her dog. She was looking after him for some neighbours
 whilst they went for a holiday to Tenerife.
 Lucky buggers, she thought, as she skirted around a
 particularly large puddle on the path. She didn't envy
 them Tenerife, just the sun. Gillian would kill for a
 week of sunshine. She absolutely detested England in
 the winter, and even though every year she promised
 herself a trip to sunnier climes, she had yet to deliver
 on that promise.</p>

<p>'Jake!' she called again as she followed his trail
 through the bracken, more in hope than expectation,
 but was pleasantly surprised to see the frisky dog
 bounding up to her. There was some cloth in his
 mouth.</p>

<p>She bent down to take it from him and realised that
 it was a Burberry scarf. Some chav and his girlfriend
 getting jiggy with it on the heath, she speculated with
 a disapproving quirk of an eyebrow. Although, to be
 fair, in this weather she admired their resilience, if
 not their respect of urban social niceties.</p>

<p>She would have turned back to the path but the
 dog trotted into a small clearing ahead and barked at
 the prostrate and motionless figure of a small, bald
 man.</p>

<p>'My God!' Gillian gasped and ran over. She knelt
 and tried to find a pulse in his neck. She couldn't be
 sure but she thought she could feel the faintest of
 murmurs. She pulled out her phone and dialled emergency
 services. Slipping out of her Barbour jacket, she
 laid it under the man's head. Thank goodness that he
 was wearing such a thick coat, she thought, because
 even though it made him look like an ancient, hairless
 Paddington Bear, it had probably saved his life.</p>

<p>Kate Walker knew she shouldn't do it, but, as she sat
 at her friend's computer terminal, she couldn't help
 herself. She typed in the access code Jane Harrington
 had, under duress, given her, and typed in
 DELANEY to pull up his hospital records. She knew
 enough not to trust anything the staff at the hospital
 had told her. She wasn't a relative; she didn't know
 exactly what she was. Girlfriend didn't sound right.
 Partner was a bit formal for what they had had.
 Mother of his child, she decided, that was what she
 was, and that gave her rights.</p>

<p>The first hit came up with Siobhan Delaney.</p>

<p>Not the rights to look at confidential medical
 records, maybe, but the man she loved was recovering
 from an operation and she wanted to know how
 bad the damage was, she justified to herself.</p>

<p>But not the right to read his ex-wife's records. Kate
 found herself unable to click the screen away and
 carried on reading it instead. That night had defined
 Delaney, after all, for the last four years. It had
 certainly defined their relationship, if such it was.
 And so, moral qualms pushed aside, Kate read the
 report.</p>

<p>Everything was much as she knew it to be. His
 pregnant wife, suffering heavy blood loss, was rushed
 into theatre. They had performed an emergency C
 section. The baby, and subsequently the mother, had
 died. The procedures seemed in order, everything but
 the outcome was in order.</p>

<p>Apart from one thing.</p>

<p>She read the document again and wished she never
 had.</p>

<p>Kate closed down the computer screen. She'd read
 the reports on Jack's injury. He had been incredibly
 lucky. The bullet had passed through the lower part
 of his left shoulder, it had broken no bones and was
 well clear of any organs. Had the police not arrived
 when they did, she reflected, it was quite likely that
 whoever had shot him would have crossed the road
 and finished the job. And her with him, likely as not.
 She shivered at the thought.</p>

<p>The door creaked open and Jane Harrington came
 back into her office, carrying a couple of mugs of
 coffee.</p>

<p>'Keep meaning to get some WD40 on that,' she
 said.</p>

<p>'I'm sorry?' Kate looked back at her, not at all sure
 what she had said.</p>

<p>'The door. Needs some oil.'</p>

<p>Kate took the coffee and took a sip. It was
 welcome. She had been up all night. Waiting for
 Delaney to go into surgery. Waiting by his bedside
 after the operation. At seven o'clock she had called
 her friend. She needed to do something, even it was
 just to see his records for herself. Things were
 spiralling out of control, that much was clear. And
 Kate needed to do something. She needed to try and
 take control. And the one thing she did know about
 was medicine.</p>

<p>Her friend observed the way she held both hands
 round the coffee mug, as if to warm more than her
 fingers. 'How is he, Kate?'</p>

<p>'He's going to be okay. For now. The bullet did as
 little damage as possible under the circumstances. He
 must have an guardian angel looking over him.'</p>

<p>'Or the other kind.'</p>

<p>'What do you mean?'</p>

<p>'He's not had a lot of luck just lately, has he?'</p>

<p>Without being aware she was doing it, Kate ran a
 hand protectively over her stomach. 'Maybe that's all
 about to change.'</p>

<p>'What about you?'</p>

<p>'What about me?'</p>

<p>'With everything that's going on, Kate. Have you
 made any decisions?'</p>

<p>Kate took another sip of her coffee. 'Yeah, I've
 decided I'm not going to take any more crap in my
 life.'</p>

<p><emphasis>He was at the bottom of a deep pool, but the
 light streaking down from the green disc ahead
 was bright and strong, the gravel and pebbles
 beneath his questing fingers were dappled with
 it. They shone like precious stones. Jack held his
 breath as he searched. He had to find it, that one
 special pebble. He had to find it and put it back
 in its rightful place and then everything would be
 all right. The world would be right again.</emphasis></p>

<p><emphasis>He didn't know how long he had been under
 but he felt the stale oxygen in his lungs swelling
 his chest painfully. He let a slow trickle of air
 bubble from his lips as he raked his fingers
 through the stones. He tried to fight back the
 rising panic as the carbon dioxide in his lungs
 now put a dull throbbing in his head. He let out
 another trickle of air and with one last scan of
 his straining eyes he realised he had failed in his
 mission, for now at least. He kicked his legs and
 swam up to the ovoid shape, the underside of his
 rowing boat. But as he neared it and tried to put
 his hand up to pull himself out, a thick arm
 descended, wrapping around his neck and
 keeping him beneath the water. His legs
 thrashed wildly as stars started exploding before
 his eyes, he knew he had to break free, he
 couldn't hold his breath any longer. He had to
 break free or drown. But he couldn't. He
 couldn't loosen the grip.</emphasis></p>

<p>Delaney eyes flew open in panic, he tried to breathe
 but couldn't. Then the man standing over him,
 dressed in a white doctor's coat, released the grip on
 his throat slightly and Delaney gulped in hungry
 swallows of air.</p>

<p>The man grunted, letting Delaney breathe but
 keeping an iron grip on his throat, keeping him
 pinned to the hospital bed. 'You got a good reason
 why I shouldn't kill you here and now?'</p>

<p>'No. But you have.'</p>

<p>'That a fact?'</p>

<p>Delaney shrugged as calmly as he could under the
 circumstances. 'Seems to be, Norrell.'</p>

<p>Norrell glared at him and finally grunted again.
 'I'll make a deal with you.'</p>

<p>'Go on.'</p>

<p>'I'll let you live and I'll even tell you who was
 behind the petrol station job. Who it was that got
 your wife killed.'</p>

<p>'The shooter.'</p>

<p>Norrell shook his head. 'The shooter was just a
 tool. You want the man who set the whole thing in
 motion.'</p>

<p>'And in return?'</p>

<p>Norrell shook his head. 'Nothing.'</p>

<p>'Nothing?'</p>

<p>'You're a loaded gun, Delaney, I'm just pulling the
 trigger.' Norrell took his hand off Delaney's throat.
 'It was Mickey Ryan.'</p>

<p>Delaney rubbed his sore throat. The man really did
 have hands like hams. 'How do you know?'</p>

<p>'He came to me first. I turned him down.'</p>

<p>Delaney was impressed. People didn't turn Mickey
 Ryan down. He was as close to an organised crime
 godfather as west London had. From a small-time
 drug dealer, he had built his empire up over the years
 like a Richard Branson of sleaze. Serious crime had
 been after him for years, but he was clever, his money
 was invested offshore. Put into holding companies.
 Shells. It made sense he was behind the property deal
 in Pinner Green. Never mind the downturn, as far as
 Delaney was concerned property prices were still the
 crime of the century. No wonder scum like Mickey
 Ryan was involved.</p>

<p>'Why'd did you say no?'</p>

<p>Norrell shrugged. 'My dad used to work for him
 when I was a kid. He treated my mother like a piece
 of shit.'</p>

<p>'Right.'</p>

<p>'I mean she <emphasis>was</emphasis> a piece of shit. But . . .' He
 shrugged again.</p>

<p>'So what do you expect me to do?' Delaney asked.</p>

<p>'Do what you do best.'</p>

<p>'Which is?'</p>

<p>'Fuck people's lives up.'</p>

<p>Norrell looked at his watch and winked at
 Delaney. 'This place isn't good for my health. I'll see
 you around.' He strode out of Delaney's private
 room.</p>

<p>Delaney thought about pushing the alarm button
 by the side of his bed, then discarded the notion. He
 knew why Norrell had just volunteered the
 information. He might just as well have put a gun to
 Mickey Ryan's head himself. There was a contract
 out on Norrell and if Delaney removed Ryan he also
 removed the contract. Delaney didn't like the idea of
 being used by Norrell, but in the end, in the grand
 scheme of things, he didn't much give a shite either.
 Mickey Ryan was a dead man walking. That was all
 that mattered. It was time to cut off his feet. Delaney
 lay his head back on the pillow and closed his eyes,
 strangely peaceful. The waiting was over.</p>

<p>He had taken the day off and so had plenty of time
 to prepare. His lizard-skin cowboy boots had been
 polished to a high shine. His black jeans had been
 neatly ironed, as had his white shirt. He held the
 shoestring tie in his hand and snapped it a couple of
 times. Form and functionality.</p>

<p>He had just had a long bath and was planning to
 have a nice relaxing morning. He was going to need
 plenty of energy tonight. He lay back naked on his
 bed and flicked the leather tie at his penis. He
 immediately started to stiffen and he flicked it
 again, harder this time. His hand moved down and
 he held himself for a moment, and then took his
 hand away. It was all about release. It was all about
 control.</p>

<p>Delaney groaned, his eyelids twitched and then fell
 still once more. He was in that halfway stage, not
 quite awake, not quite asleep, when you know your
 dreams have hold over you, but you are powerless to
 let them go.</p>

<p>The smell was universal. The noises in the dark.
 Hospital. Other hospitals.</p>

<p><emphasis>Jack Delaney was nine years old. He was
 walking back from school alone. His best friend
 Rory had been off sick with measles and he was
 forbidden to visit him. Jack was okay with that.
 He had seen kids with the measles right enough
 and he could do without them. He'd catch up
 with Rory when he was well.</emphasis></p>

<p><emphasis>Like Jack, Rory was big for his age, bigger
 even than Jack. Everyone said when he grew up
 he'd either be a policeman or professional
 wrestler. It was their joke. What Rory wanted to
 do when he grew up was be a carpenter like his
 da. Heck, his ma always joked, sure enough he
 could just pick the trees out of the ground, he'd
 have no need for lumberjacks for his raw
 materials. Rory took it in good humour, you had
 to keep the women on your side.</emphasis></p>

<p><emphasis>Jack agreed with him on that one. He didn't
 know what he wanted to do when he grew up,
 though. They talked about it often enough but
 he couldn't fix himself on anything. Fireman one
 week. A soldier a few years back before the
 Troubles had flared up in earnest. Sometimes he
 secretly dreamed of being a priest. Jack could see
 himself standing up there in the pulpit, holding
 everybody in awe as he railed and castigated. He
 was not so hot at the academics, however, and
 he saw how the black crows knew everything
 about everything, and that must take an awful
 lot of book studying and the like.</emphasis></p>

<p><emphasis>He bent down to pick up a pebble form the
 path. He threw the stone high in the air to clatter
 down on the salt-crusted stones on the beach
 below, when he heard the cry. And he recognised
 the voice.</emphasis></p>

<p><emphasis>He rushed down the path and around the
 corner. And there, sure enough, was Liam
 Corrigan, his cousin. Liam was a couple of years
 younger than Jack, a few inches shorter, and was
 surrounded by four older boys with mischief on
 their faces and sticks in their hands. Jack could
 see that Liam had tears in his eyes and a small
 trickle of blood running down his nose.</emphasis></p>

<p><emphasis>Jack knew the other boys. All MacWhites. All
 trouble. Like the family had always been. Jack
 turned to the eldest. 'Brave of you to be taking
 on the one boy.'</emphasis></p>

<p><emphasis>Barry MacWhite looked at Jack and grinned,
 strolling over to him. 'You want to join in, do
 you? Do you want some of—'</emphasis></p>

<p><emphasis>But he never finished the sentence as Jack had
 smashed his fist furiously and suddenly into the
 older boy's nose. The boy dropped squealing to
 his knees, Jack snatched the stick from his hand
 and turned to the three remaining MacWhites.</emphasis></p>

<p><emphasis>'Come on then, ya gobshites.'</emphasis></p>

<p><emphasis>He waved the stick in front of him and pushed
 Liam towards the road. 'Get out of here, Liam.'</emphasis></p>

<p><emphasis>And as his young cousin ran off the road for
 help, Delaney turned and faced the others, an
 anger beyond his years burning in his eyes and
 the other youths circled him as warily as a pack
 of dogs would approach a wounded wolf.</emphasis></p>

<p><emphasis>Had help not arrived when it did, things might
 have gone a lot worse for Jack than it did. But
 that was just the first time he ended up in
 hospital because of his cousin Liam. On that
 occasion it was for a fractured wrist. On the
 second occasion it was for something far more
 serious.</emphasis></p>

<p><emphasis>'He's coming round.'</emphasis></p>

<p><emphasis>Jack heard the voice and tried to open his eyes.
 He felt as if he had been run over by a herd of
 cattle. Every muscle in his body ached. But most
 of all there was a stabbing pain in his side.</emphasis></p>

<p><emphasis>'God bless you, Jack. You've done a
 marvellous thing.'</emphasis></p>

<p><emphasis>Jack blinked his eyes and could just about
 make out his aunt looking down at him, smiling
 gratefully.</emphasis></p>

<p><emphasis>'Is he going to be all right?' he asked.</emphasis></p>

<p><emphasis>'Yes, Jack,' his aunt said, taking his hand and
 patting it. 'He's going to be just grand. You both
 are.'</emphasis></p>

<p><emphasis>The fact that she crossed herself immediately
 after saying it might have given others cause for
 concern, but Jack Delaney was sixteen years old
 and invincible.</emphasis></p>

<p><emphasis>'You've saved his life, Jack. You've saved his
 life,' cried his aunt, bursting into tears.</emphasis></p>

<p><emphasis>Jack shrugged. 'Sure, it was only a kidney.'</emphasis></p>

<p>A hospital trolley laden with pills and syringes and
 God knows what else clattered past his bed and
 Delaney cursed silently. The thin tendrils of sleep that
 were clinging to him were severed by the sound. He
 was awake now, he was in pain, and he was going to
 have to deal with it.</p>

<p>He leaned his head further up the pillow and
 groaned, the last few images of his dreams lingering
 in his consciousness. Why had he been dreaming
 about his cousin Liam? Why had he been remembering
 those incidents? It wasn't just being in
 hospital. Delaney groaned again and raised himself to
 sit up in bed. He ran his good right hand over his
 bandaged shoulder and strapped-up left arm and
 grimaced. Who was he kidding? He knew exactly
 why he was thinking about Liam. He threw back the
 covers and slid his legs to the floor. Standing up and
 wincing at the pain in his shoulder, he looked at the
 clock. Way past time. The pain forgotten as he picked
 up his clothes from the chair beside his bed.</p>

<p>As an alarm bell sounded, Kate and Sally ran concerned
 down the corridor and into his room.</p>

<p>Kate couldn't believe her eyes. 'Bloody, stupid,
 bloody man!'</p>

<p>'Where's he gone?'</p>

<p>'I don't know, Sally. You're the detective. Where
 do men with no brain cells go?' Kate snapped.</p>

<p>Sally shrugged. 'Paddington Green?'</p>

<p>Kate glared at her. 'Yeah, not funny.'</p>

<p>They went back outside and Kate stopped one of
 two nurses who were hurrying down the corridor.
 'What's going on?'</p>

<p>'A prisoner's escaped from the secure room.'</p>

<p>Kate sighed. 'Don't tell me – Kevin Norrell.'</p>

<p>The nurse nodded. 'The officer who was guarding
 them is seriously hurt.'</p>

<p>'And the other prisoner here? The one with the
 broken jaw?'</p>

<p>The nurse looked at Kate, shocked, as if she could
 hardly believe the words that were coming out of her
 mouth. 'He's dead.'</p>

<p>Sally took Kate's arm. 'You don't think Jack's
 busted Norrell loose?'</p>

<p>Kate shook her head, her voice trembling with
 anger and fear. 'I don't know, Sally. Let's find the
 stupid man.'</p>

<p>Melanie Jones sat at her desk writing on her computer.
 She read what she had just written and then
 highlighted and deleted it. It was all garbage. This
 was supposed to be her big break and what did she
 have to show for it? They had a guy in custody who
 they figured was good for the murders, but she had
 listened to his voice at the police's request and she
 couldn't be sure it was the man who had telephoned
 her. She had no idea what Delaney had been doing
 with his comments about deformed genitalia in his
 press statement either. She had dealt with the police
 enough times to know that they didn't release that
 kind of detail. If she didn't know better, she would
 have said he was deliberately trying to rile the
 murderer. But if he was already in custody, what was
 the point? She thought ironically about the title of the
 book she had in mind. <emphasis>Intimate Conversations With
 a Serial Killer</emphasis>. Some intimacy! She'd exchanged
 about ten words with the man. And the main part of
 the book, looking at the investigation through the
 eyes of the lead detective, had gone tits up as well.
 The suspect had been arrested by plain clothes and
 not only had Jack Delaney been taken off the case it
 looked like he had been taken out for good. Some
 nutter, probably an ex-girlfriend and good luck to
 her, had shot him and left him in intensive care in
 South Hampstead Hospital. Be just her luck if he died
 on her as well. So much for the New York office and
 the dream job. She had seen herself as a modern-day
 Truman Capote; as it was she was turning into more
 of a Lois Lane. Everything happened when she wasn't
 there, and her Superman turned out to be an Irish
 drunk whose IQ was no higher than her shoe size.</p>

<p>'Shit,' she said aloud, for the thirtieth time that
 day. And then the phone rang.</p>

<p>She picked it up, suppressing a yawn. 'Melanie
 Jones, Sky News.'</p>

<p>The lilting brogue on the other end of the line
 jolted the yawn into oblivion.</p>

<p>'Roses are crap, me darlin'. Violets are shit. Sit on
 me face, and wriggle a bit.'</p>

<p>'Delaney?'</p>

<p>'Ah no, sad to hear he's not well.'</p>

<p>'Who is this?'</p>

<p>There was laugher on the other end of the line and
 the accent changed to English. 'Well now, it's not
 Santa's little helper. But I could be your lucky charm.'</p>

<p>And Melanie recognised the voice, belatedly
 hitting the record button built into her digital phone
 system.</p>

<p>'I'm listening.'</p>

<p>'www.truecrimeways.com.'</p>

<p>'What's that?'</p>

<p>'The password is Whitechapel and your birthday.'</p>

<p>'But what is it?'</p>

<p>The line went dead and Melanie was left listening
 to a single persistent tone. She blinked for a moment
 as though mesmerised and then hung up the phone,
 her fingers flashing across her keyboard with more
 enthusiasm than she had had all morning.</p>

<p>Delaney winced, held his side and leaned against the
 wall of the visitors' centre. He put a cigarette in his
 mouth and searched through his pockets for a box of
 matches. He twisted his hand to the other pocket and
 picked out the box with his fingertips. He pulled the
 box open with his teeth and managed to get a match
 out. But how he was going to strike it he had
 absolutely no idea.</p>

<p>'Jack Delaney!'</p>

<p>He looked across and cursed as he saw Kate
 Walker and Sally Cartwright bearing down on him.
 Great, he thought, double tagged.</p>

<p>'What the hell do you think you're doing?'</p>

<p>'I'm trying to have a cigarette, Kate.'</p>

<p>Kate glared at him. 'I thought you'd given up?'</p>

<p>'I did. I'm very good at giving up. I do it all the
 time.'</p>

<p>'You should be in bed, boss,' Sally said, taking the
 box of matches off him and lighting his cigarette.</p>

<p>Kate shook her head, resigned. 'You realise Norrell
 has escaped.'</p>

<p>'Yeah, I know.'</p>

<p>'It's not safe for you, Jack.'</p>

<p>'He's not going to do anything to me.'</p>

<p>'How can you be so sure?'</p>

<p>'I just know.' Delaney drew deep on his cigarette.
 'Sally, I need you to drive me.'</p>

<p>Kate sneered. 'Are you mad? You're not going
 anywhere.'</p>

<p>'I have to.'</p>

<p>'For God's sake, Sally, talk some sense into him.'</p>

<p>'Where do you want to go?' Sally asked.</p>

<p>'I'll tell you in the car.'</p>

<p>Kate stepped between them. 'No, if anybody is
 driving you it will be me.'</p>

<p>Delaney looked across at Sally, then shrugged with
 a little smile and kissed Kate full on the lips, who was
 too startled to back away. 'No, I've got another job
 for you to do.'</p>

<p>'What?'</p>

<p>'There's a man in intensive care. I saw him on my
 way out and recognised him. He was shot on
 Hampstead Heath last night. Near where we found
 the first victim.'</p>

<p>'I thought the latest theory was it was a Jack the
 Ripper copycat, killing prostitutes.'</p>

<p>'Maybe we were supposed to think that. He was
 shot in the same area with a tranquilliser rifle. I don't
 believe in coincidences, Kate. Check it out, find out if
 it's the same tranquillising drug.'</p>

<p>'What does it mean if it is?'</p>

<p>Delaney ground his cigarette under his heel. 'I have
 absolutely no idea.'</p>

<p>He turned to Sally. 'Come on, Constable, you can
 drive.'</p>

<p>Sally shrugged helplessly at Kate and followed him
 to the car.</p>

<p>*</p>

<p>George Napier hung up the telephone. He was far
 from pleased. Serious crimes had just released Ashley
 Bradley on police bail. On top of that Kevin Norrell
 had escaped from the police guard at the South
 Hampstead Hospital. And if that wasn't enough,
 Delaney had gone walkabout too. Napier opened the
 bottom drawer of his desk cabinet and pulled out a
 bottle of milk of magnesia. He had just taken a
 healthy swig, when Diane Campbell walked into the
 room. Why couldn't she keep a damn leash on her
 Irish bloody inspector? he'd like to know. Was it too
 much to ask?</p>

<p>Diane read his expression and nodded, at the
 bottle. 'Ulcer?</p>

<p>Napier grimaced. 'Indigestion.'</p>

<p>'It's going to get a lot worse.'</p>

<p>'What are you talking about?'</p>

<p>Diane picked up the TV remote control from
 Napier's desk, pointed it at the large television in the
 corner of the room and turned it on. Melanie Jones's
 picture-perfect face filled the screen.</p>

<p>'Sky News is now exclusively able to reveal a
 gruesome new development in the murders of two
 sex workers. One was found on Hampstead Heath
 three days ago and the second found murdered in a
 flat in Camden Town. Sky News understands that
 horrific details concerning the murders lead police to
 believe they are dealing with a Jack the Ripper
 copycat killer. Sky News has been given exclusive
 access to scene-of-the-crime photographs and
 forensic details that show that there is no
 coincidence. In a further development, the suspect the
 police were holding in connection with these killings
 has now been released.'</p>

<p>Diane Campbell pushed the mute button cutting
 off the sound as the television now flashed up
 pictures of the two dead women.</p>

<p>'How the hell did they get hold of this, Diane?'</p>

<p>'The killer told them, sir.'</p>

<p>'Why?'</p>

<p>'Clearly he didn't think he was getting the
 recognition he deserved.'</p>

<p>'Get that reporter in here. And where the fuck is
 Delaney?'</p>

<p>It wasn't the first time Chief Inspector Diane
 Campbell had heard that question, but it was the first
 time she had ever heard George Napier swear.</p>

<p>Sally pulled the car to a stop outside a betting shop
 on the Kilburn High Road. It was called Right Bet
 and was either in danger of going bust or the owners
 felt it didn't do to advertise wealth.</p>

<p>Delaney struggled to get the seat belt out of its
 socket and Sally leaned across. 'Let me.'</p>

<p>She pushed the button and his seat belt snapped
 back. Delaney rubbed his sore shoulder. 'It would be
 a lot easier if I didn't wear the fricking thing in the
 first place. I'm in enough pain as it is, you know.'</p>

<p>Sally smiled at him. 'Clunk click, every trip.'</p>

<p>'Just wait here.' Delaney opened the car door.</p>

<p>'You sure you don't want me with you?'</p>

<p>'Quite sure.'</p>

<p>Delaney got out of the car and walked to the shop,
 kicking aside an empty tin of Special Brew as he
 entered. It was a small shop. No customers. Sheets of
 paper posted around the room with the various horse
 and dog race meets covered on them. In the corner
 was a small television showing dogs running at
 Brough Park in Newcastle. Behind the counter was a
 large, bored-looking, bald man in his forties with a
 barrel of a beer belly and, in defiance of the regulations,
 a lit fag dangling from his lips. He looked up
 from his copy of <emphasis>Sunday Sport</emphasis>.</p>

<p>'Help you?'</p>

<p>'Is Liam in?'</p>

<p>'And who wants him?'</p>

<p>Delaney looked over his shoulder at the empty
 shop behind him then back at the man again. 'That
 would be me.' The large man opened his mouth to
 say something but Delaney didn't have the energy for
 it. 'Just tell him it's Jack Delaney.'</p>

<p>The man grunted and disappeared through the
 door to his left.</p>

<p>Delaney looked up at the television screen. A
 brindled greyhound carrying the number seven won
 the race. Delaney's lucky number.</p>

<p>'Jack Delaney, you Irish motherfucker!'</p>

<p>Delaney turned round to see his cousin grinning at
 him. He may have been smaller than Delaney at age
 seven, now he was four inches taller and good few
 stones heavier. And all of it muscle. He threw open
 the hatch and grappled Delaney in a bear hug.</p>

<p>'Oi. Watch my fecking shoulders.'</p>

<p>'Sorry, big man.' Liam released him and gestured.
 'Come on back. I'll pull the ring on a cup of tea.'</p>

<p>Delaney followed him through the counter and
 back into a medium-sized office. A desk, an
 armchair, a fridge, some filing cabinets. The dusty
 window at the back showed a yard with a skip, a
 shopping trolley and a couple of cars. One of them a
 brand new jag. Liam was doing okay for himself,
 Delaney reckoned, but then he already knew that.</p>

<p>Liam opened the fridge and pulled out a couple of
 tins of lager. Foster's, thankfully, not Special Brew,
 and handed one to his cousin.</p>

<p>Delaney awkwardly pulled the tab and took a
 couple of grateful swallows. He hadn't realised how
 thirsty he was.</p>

<p>'So, what can I do for you, big man?'</p>

<p>'I need a piece, Liam.'</p>

<p>'I see.' His cousin nodded seriously and gestured at
 his bandaged shoulder. 'This got anything to do with
 the fancy dress outfit?'</p>

<p>'Yup. I want to repay the compliment.'</p>

<p>'I'd advise you make a better job of it if you do.'</p>

<p>'Count on that.'</p>

<p>Liam smiled, not doubting it. 'And what makes
 you think your law-abiding cousin would have access
 to unlicensed and unauthorised firearms?'</p>

<p>'Just get me a piece, Liam.'</p>

<p>Liam considered for a moment and then stood up.
 'Anything for you, Jack. You know that.'</p>

<p>He stood up and moved the fridge to one side,
 pulled up a loose floorboard, rummaged beneath and
 pulled out a cloth-wrapped package, which he
 handed to Delaney.</p>

<p>'Ammunition in there. You want to tell me what
 you need it for?'</p>

<p>'Nope.'</p>

<p>'You want any help with it?'</p>

<p>Delaney held up the bundle. 'Just this.'</p>

<p>Liam laughed. 'What are you going to do, stick it
 down your trousers? Jesus, man, you'll be back in
 casualty with your cock shot off, and what'll I tell
 your daughter then? Hang on. I'll get you a holster.'</p>

<p>Delaney nodded gratefully. His cousin had a point.</p>

<p>Kate Walker tapped on Diane Campbell's office,
 walked in and shut the door behind her. She wasn't
 surprised to see the superintendent standing by the
 open window smoking a cigarette. Jack Delaney and
 Diane Campbell could support a tobacco plantation
 between them.</p>

<p>'Hi, Kate.'</p>

<p>'Diane.'</p>

<p>'Want to tell me where Jack Delaney is?'</p>

<p>'Believe me, if I knew I'd be more than happy to
 tell you.'</p>

<p>'Why do we put up with him?'</p>

<p>'God's punishment for a previous life.'</p>

<p>'Now I <emphasis>do</emphasis> believe you have spent too much time
 with him.' She tossed her cigarette out of the window
 and walked across the room as Kate opened her
 shoulder bag. 'What have you got for me?'</p>

<p>Kate pulled out two photos and a sheet of paper
 which she handed to the superintendent.</p>

<p>'Both female victims had the same puncture wound
 to the neck. A very forceful puncture wound made, I
 believe, by a tranquilliser gun or rifle.'</p>

<p>Diane had picked up on what Kate had said. 'What
 do you mean by "the female victims"?'</p>

<p>Kate pointed at the paper she had given Diane.
 'Last night a man was shot on Hampstead Heath.
 Again it looks like with a tranquilliser dart. He had a
 near fatal dose of the stuff in him. He was lucky to
 survive the night.'</p>

<p>'Does he have any idea who did it?'</p>

<p>'He's not speaking yet.'</p>

<p>'But he's going to make it?'</p>

<p>'Yeah, he's going to make it.'</p>

<p>Diane's forehead creased as she looked back at the
 photos. 'So, you're saying this is the same killer.
 What's the connection? Mr James Collins the surgical
 registrar is not exactly a female prostitute, is he?'</p>

<p>'Not unless my seven years of medical training
 missed something very important.'</p>

<p>'So what the hell is going on?'</p>

<p>But if Dr Walker had any answers to that they
 certainly weren't showing on her face.</p>

<p>Jimmy Skinner rubbed his eyes. He was used to
 staring at a computer monitor for hours, but that was
 playing poker. Wading through reports was a
 different matter. Plus, he reckoned he was wasting his
 time. Paddington Green were in charge of the case
 now. But the killer was still at large, the public were
 at risk, and at times like this all hands were called to
 the deck. It just wasn't the deck he would have
 preferred.</p>

<p>He flicked on and read the inventory of what had
 been found in the second victim's apartment. All the
 videos and DVDs were sex videos. As were the
 magazines. No <emphasis>Home &amp; Country</emphasis>, no <emphasis>Good
 Housekeeping</emphasis>, not even a Delia Smith cookery book.
 He lived on his own and never ever cooked and even
 he had a copy of her summer cookery book. For this
 working girl the property was clearly just that: a
 workplace. She lived elsewhere, he'd bet on it like he
 was holding a royal flush.</p>

<p>He made himself a cup of coffee and went through
 the copies of the paperwork again. There were about
 twelve shoeboxes' worth of them, mostly receipts for
 items all paid for by cash, and letters from prospective
 or satisfied clients. There were no phone bills
 as there was no landline to the property, she
 obviously only took bookings on her mobile.</p>

<p>As he rubbed his tired eyes an hour later he realised
 one receipt didn't match all the others. A vet's bill. It
 was the one thing that didn't have a connection with
 anything in the flat. Suddenly energised he picked up
 the phone and got the directory service to connect
 him directly with the office named on the receipt.</p>

<p>A short while after that and Jimmy hung up the
 phone, picked up his coat and was hurrying out the
 door. The vet had confirmed the receipt was
 regarding surgical work done on a Siamese cat, but
 the name didn't match the one Jimmy had given him.
 The vet refused to give out the name and address
 unless he saw some identification. His premises were
 in Mornington Crescent off the Hampstead Road.
 Jimmy stood up and pulled his jacket off the back of
 the chair when Diane Campbell came in and leaned
 against the door frame.</p>

<p>'You got something?'</p>

<p>Skinner nodded. 'Got a lead on the second victim.'</p>

<p>'Good. Looks like we might have the name of the
 first, too.'</p>

<p>'How come?'</p>

<p>'Her mother's made contact. At least she thinks it's
 her daughter.'</p>

<p>'Thinks?'</p>

<p>'She hasn't seen her since she was fifteen years old.'</p>

<p>'Family row?'</p>

<p>'The father was abusing her.'</p>

<p>'What's her name?'</p>

<p>'When she left home she was called Maureen
 Carey. But no such name is flagging on our
 databases.'</p>

<p>'Working girl?' Jimmy shrugged. 'Likely not using
 her real name.'</p>

<p>Campbell nodded in agreement and stood aside for
 Skinner to leave. 'Keep me posted.'</p>

<p>'You got it.'</p>

<p>Sally pulled her car to a stop by the McDonald's on
 the corner of Shaftesbury Avenue and Dean Street,
 ignoring the angry honking from furious motorists
 behind her.</p>

<p>'Are you sure you don't want me to come with you,
 sir?'</p>

<p>'Quite sure, Sally, thanks.'</p>

<p>'You going to be back in time for a drink tonight?'</p>

<p>'I thought you had a hot date?</p>

<p>'Hardly that, sir. Just dinner with Michael Hill. But
 a few of us are going to the Pig first. You wouldn't be
 a gooseberry.'</p>

<p>'I'll think about it.'</p>

<p>Sally put her hand on his arm as he reached across
 for the door handle. 'I want to help, sir. Whatever it
 is you know I've got your back.'</p>

<p>Delaney nodded and quickly opened the door before
 she could press the matter. This was something he had
 to take care of himself and it was way past time.</p>

<p>It was a typically grey, wet and windy late-autumn
 day in Soho as Delaney walked up Dean Street,
 pulling his jacket as best he could around him. Since
 dislocating his shoulder and then being shot he was
 certainly feeling the cold a lot more. Christ, I'm
 getting old, he thought. Maybe he should do a Kate
 Walker, get out of the madness of it all while he still
 had a chance. The thought of Kate made him smile
 almost, took a little of the chill off his bones. To
 think he had almost let her get away again. And for
 what? For the fear he wouldn't be able to change?
 That he would carry the past around with him like a
 hunchback unable to straighten himself? Well, today
 was the day for all that to be put in the past once and
 for all. If Delaney was a sickness then Kate Walker
 was his cure. She would take the curve from his spine
 and make him walk tall again. But first he had
 business to attend to. The man who was responsible
 for his wife's death, who had put the weight on his
 back in the first place, the man who was responsible
 for Delaney being shot, for the murder of Derek
 Watters, for the attack on Kevin Norrell. The man
 responsible for all that was going to look in his eyes
 today. That man was going to look in his cold,
 brown eyes and regret he had ever heard the name
 Jack Delaney. Today was the day for drawing a line.</p>

<p>A crowd of loudly smug media types spilled out of
 the Groucho Club as he passed, knocking into him
 and making him wince as his shoulder jarred. Any
 other day he would have had words, but today he
 kept his head down. The pieces of the puzzle were
 finally coming together and Delaney had no time for
 petty distractions.</p>

<p>He looked at his watch. Two o'clock. He used his
 less damaged shoulder to push a door open and
 walked into one of the new breed of bars that had
 sprung up in the area. All polished wood and chrome
 and bright lights. Might as well be drinking in an
 IKEA store, he reckoned, but today he hardly
 registered it. He ordered a large whisky straight up
 and downed it one. He ordered another and held out
 his hand looking at the slight tremble in his fingers.
 He put it down to his injuries. His nervous system
 was shot to pieces, that's all it was.</p>

<p>He finished his second drink and left the pub,
 crossing over the street fifty yards further up the road
 and heading down a narrow cul-de-sac, at the end of
 which was a small club called Hot Totty. It didn't open
 until the late afternoon, but Delaney waited for a
 moment or two and then taking a deep breath he
 pulled a balaclava over his head, pushed the door open
 and went inside. A thin man in his mid-twenties was
 behind the counter of a small bar refilling the spirit
 optics. He called over his shoulder as he heard the
 door.</p>

<p>'We're not open.'</p>

<p>'I've not come for a lap dance.'</p>

<p>The man turned round and nearly dropped the
 bottle of whisky he was holding. Delaney was
 pointing a gun straight at him.</p>

<p>'Hey, I just work here.'</p>

<p>'Is he in the back?'</p>

<p>The barman nodded nervously.</p>

<p>'You got a good memory, son?'</p>

<p>The barman considered it for a bit not sure what
 he was supposed to say. 'No, sir.'</p>

<p>Delaney jerked his thumb at the door behind him.
 'Get out then. You want to stay alive, keep it that
 way.'</p>

<p>The man held his hands up, nodding and scuttling
 out of the door like a scorpion on a hot skillet.</p>

<p>Delaney thought about Mickey Ryan as he
 watched the barman scurry away. There wasn't a
 detective in the Met who hadn't come up against him
 in one way or another. But he was the original Teflon
 man, nothing stuck to him. Witnesses were silenced,
 detectives were bought off, blackmailed or terrorised.
 He was a brutal, vicious, successful, self-made man.
 A shining example of everything Thatcher's Britain
 had created.</p>

<p>Delaney took off the balaclava. He didn't care if
 Mickey Ryan saw him. In fact he wanted him to
 know who was putting him in the ground.</p>

<p>He walked to the back of the small auditorium,
 past the stage and the pole, not even registering the
 slightly sour smell of body oil that tainted the air like
 a cheap perfume.</p>

<p>It wasn't hard to find Ryan's office. He pushed the
 door open holding the gun forward and walked in. It
 was a windowless room, but glowed with opulence.
 Rich carpeting, Tiffany-style lamps, artwork on the
 walls. His dead wife's brother-in-law would fit right
 in here, Delaney thought. Mickey Ryan was sitting
 behind a large desk typing on a laptop. He looked up,
 bored.</p>

<p>'What do you want, Delaney?'</p>

<p>Delaney gestured at the cubic man who stood not
 far from his boss.</p>

<p>'Put your hands up, Nigel.'</p>

<p>The man glared at him. 'My name's not fucking
 Nigel.'</p>

<p>'Just do what he says, Pete.'</p>

<p>The man raised his hands, glaring venomously at
 Delaney.</p>

<p>Delaney turned back to the man behind the desk.
 'Tell him to stop staring at me, Mickey. I might just
 wet myself.'</p>

<p>'What the fuck do you want, Delaney?'</p>

<p>'You know what I want.'</p>

<p>'I'm the fucking oracle of Delphi, am I now?'</p>

<p>'No, you're a two-bit slag who has made good on
 other people's misery for far too long. And now it's
 time to pay the rent.'</p>

<p>Ryan laughed out loud. 'Do you hear this guy,
 Pete? He should be on the fucking telly.' His smile
 died. 'After what happened to Norrell and that
 prison guard, you should have taken the hint,
 Delaney. Nobody fucks with me and walks away.'</p>

<p>'That a fact?' Delaney moved the gun forward
 aiming at his forehead.</p>

<p>'You had the balls, Irishman, you'd have done it
 already. Your wife was in the wrong place at the wrong
 time, that's all. If someone hadn't interfered she'd still
 be alive today, wouldn't she? That's down to you.'</p>

<p>Delaney's finger tightened on the trigger as he put
 his left hand on his right shoulder. 'You should have
 killed me when you had the chance.'</p>

<p>'Yeah, well, can't get the staff, isn't that what they
 say? But I've got a better man on the case now.'</p>

<p>Delaney smiled unimpressed. 'Who, Nigel here?'</p>

<p>'No,' said Mickey Ryan. 'Him.' And pointed
 behind Delaney.</p>

<p>Delaney couldn't stop himself from turning round
 as he felt a presence behind him, and reacted unable
 to conceal the surprise at who he saw.</p>

<p>'Liam?'</p>

<p>'Sorry, Jack.' And his cousin hit Delaney on the
 side of the head with a narrow leather cosh.</p>

<p>He dropped to the floor like a hanged man with
 the noose cut.</p>

<p>Jimmy Skinner rang the bell for a third time. There
 was still no answer. He looked around him then
 picked up the door ram he had brought with him just
 in case, and smashed the door open. A Siamese cat
 screamed at him and went howling and hissing past
 his legs, nearly knocking him over. He guessed the
 operation it had had, whatever it was, had been a
 success.</p>

<p>Inside the maisonette the smell was pretty bad.
 The cat obviously hadn't been let out for a couple of
 days. He walked into the lounge and opened the
 windows. On the mantelpiece there was a photo of a
 woman. He picked it up and looked at it closely, he
 could see a slight resemblance to the woman he had
 seen on the website but he would have never recognised
 her. The woman in the photo had mousy hair
 and wore little make-up. She smiled shyly at the
 camera. No wonder nobody had phoned in after
 their televised appeals for information about her. In
 the kitchen the cat's litter tray needed to be cleaned
 out. Skinner crinkled his nose, picked up a black
 leather Filofax from the kitchen table and took it
 back into the lounge.</p>

<p>He flicked through the pages and turned to the
 diary section. She had kept a list of appointments
 with clients. One of the names, Paul Archer, jumped
 out at him, but he couldn't put his finger on why.
 Seemed he liked rough games and she had refused to
 see him any more, blacklisted him with her contacts
 too. He filed the name away. Somebody had a grudge
 with her, that much was obvious. Another part of the
 Filofax was day-to-day diary stuff. After half an hour
 he flicked back to the contacts section; he sighed and
 closed the Filofax and walked over to a table that had
 a collection of framed photographs on it and picked
 one up. It showed two women, one in her twenties
 and one in her thirties. Hands around each other's
 waists and smiling at the camera, as if they knew
 their profession was to be judged now by the quality
 of that smile as much as it was by the service and care
 they provided.</p>

<p>And he realised as he looked at the photograph
 that they had all got it completely wrong.</p>

<p>Delaney felt like someone had taken a heavy hammer
 and struck him on the head. It was definitely time for
 a new job, he thought. Somewhere warm.
 Somewhere quiet. But, as he cracked open his
 bloodshot eyes, he realised that new employment
 prospects were the least of his problems. His hands
 had been tied behind his back and he was sitting in a
 lock-up garage somewhere, propped uncomfortably
 on a wooden chair. The door opened and Mickey
 Ryan walked in, followed by his cubic minder and his
 traitorous fucking cousin. If Delaney could have
 worked up the saliva he would have spat at him.</p>

<p>There was a metallic clang. Delaney looked across
 to see the gorilla of a henchman putting a toolbox on
 the workbench that ran along the whole left-hand
 side of the garage. The man made Kevin Norrell look
 human, he realised with a shudder.</p>

<p>'You might wonder why you are still alive,
 Delaney.'</p>

<p>'Must be my guardian angel.'</p>

<p>Ryan laughed, his blue eyes sparkling with amusement.
 'I wonder if you'll still be laughing when my
 man here goes to work on you with a pair of needle-tooth
 pliers.</p>

<p>Liam stepped forward. 'Nobody said anything
 about that.'</p>

<p>'Nobody points a gun at me and gets away with it.
 You're going to learn that, Delaney. And that
 grassing tub of lard Norrell is going to be next.' He
 turned to Liam. 'Put one in his gut, give him
 something to think about.'</p>

<p>Liam raised the pistol he had been holding in his
 right hand, a semi-automatic with a silencer. Delaney
 could see no mercy, no compassion in his eyes as he
 pulled the trigger.</p>

<p>The minder made a sound like a dog swallowing a
 fly and dropped to the floor, a hand fluttering
 towards his heart but not making it. Liam pointed the
 gun at Mickey Ryan.</p>

<p>'The fuck you think you're doing?'</p>

<p>'The fuck you think I'm doing?' Liam retorted.</p>

<p>Ryan shook his head. 'We had a deal.'</p>

<p>'I don't make deals with scum. Gut shot, wasn't it?'
 He pulled the trigger again, and Mickey Ryan
 dropped to his knees, squealing and holding his
 stomach. 'Hurts, doesn't it?'</p>

<p>Ryan's face had gone purple and he hissed between
 his teeth, but if they were words they were not
 intelligible.</p>

<p>Liam grabbed a Stanley knife from the toolbox and
 slashed the ropes binding his cousin.</p>

<p>Delaney stood up and wobbled on his legs. He had
 to hold on to his cousin's arm before he could steady
 himself. 'What's going on?'</p>

<p>Liam smiled. 'I made some calls after you left.
 Figured out what was what and realised you'd be
 way out of your depth.'</p>

<p>'I had it covered.'</p>

<p>'Sure you did, cousin. But you weren't going to kill
 him, were you?'</p>

<p>Delaney didn't answer.</p>

<p>'Which means that one way or another he would
 have ended up killing you.'</p>

<p>'Maybe.'</p>

<p>'No maybe about it.'</p>

<p>'What did you have to hit me for, then?'</p>

<p>'You might be ten kinds of death-wish on legs,
 Jack, but I still enjoy my life. I did what I had to do.
 And you should be grateful, so take a Panadol and
 shut the fuck up with the whining already.'</p>

<p>Ryan gurgled again, hissing through wet lips, his
 face contorted with pain.</p>

<p>Liam turned to Delaney and held the gun out. 'Do
 you want to do it?'</p>

<p>Delaney made no move to take the pistol. Liam
 nodded then fired two bullets into the kneeling man's
 head. He slumped sideways and the gurgling stopped.</p>

<p>Delaney looked at the dead body. He wasn't sure
 what to think any more. 'What now?'</p>

<p>'Now, cousin, we walk away from here.'</p>

<p>Delaney shook his head. 'We can't. There's DNA
 all over the place. You go. Leave me the gun.'</p>

<p>Liam reached into his overcoat and pulled out a
 large brown packet. 'Did you know Mickey Ryan
 was in big with the old IRA? Back in the seventies?'</p>

<p>'No.'</p>

<p>Liam nodded. 'Back in the day he made a fair few
 bob out of it. Pissed a fair few people off too. People
 who didn't take the laying down of arms at all
 happily. Formed new groups.'</p>

<p>'The Real IRA?'</p>

<p>Liam shrugged. 'Amongst others. Either way, he's
 on a list. And this . . .' he tossed the packet on the
 workbench, 'is the boys' old friend.'</p>

<p>'Semtex?'</p>

<p>'There won't be enough left of Mickey Ryan, his
 sidekick, or this garage to fill a teaspoon.'</p>

<p>Delaney nodded. It didn't feel like closure. He just
 felt empty.</p>

<p>'I guess that makes us even, Liam.'</p>

<p>'Hardly.' He handed back his mobile phone.
 'Thought you might like this back.'</p>

<p>'Thanks.' Delaney flipped it open and pushed the
 speed dial for Kate Walker.</p>

<p>'Jack, where the hell have you been?'</p>

<p>Liam smiled, he could hear every word. 'What is it
 with you and feisty women?'</p>

<p>'Are you still at the station?' Delaney asked
 Kate.</p>

<p>'Yes, I'm still here.'</p>

<p>'Good, stay there. I'm on my way in.'</p>

<p>*</p>

<p>Sally Cartwright looked at her watch for the fifth
 time.</p>

<p>'Has he stood you up, Sally?'</p>

<p>'Yeah, funny, Danny.' Sally flashed a none too
 amused smile at her colleague at the other end of the
 table. There were a few of them there, having a drink
 or two and, as yet, Michael Hill hadn't shown up.
 Danny, jealous that she was going out for a curry
 with him, had been making snide little remarks,
 doing himself no favours in her book at all. But she
 wasn't worried about Michael, she'd seen the eagerness
 in his puppy-dog eyes. He was probably
 nervous. No, it wasn't Michael Hill who had her
 looking at her watch, it was Jack Delaney she was
 concerned about. There was a darkness is his eyes
 when he had left her on Shaftesbury Avenue.
 Something darker than she had ever seen before.</p>

<p>A cheer went up from Danny and a couple of his
 mates as Michael Hill eventually came in and walked
 over to join them. Sally thought he looked nice. Black
 jeans, a nicely ironed white shirt and a black jacket.</p>

<p>'It's Rhydian!' Danny called out. 'Go on, sing us a
 song.'</p>

<p>'Ignore him,' Sally said. 'He's an idiot.'</p>

<p>'I will.'</p>

<p>He sat down beside her.</p>

<p>'Actually, I'm glad you're here,' said Sally.</p>

<p>'Of course. We're going for a curry, aren't we?'</p>

<p>'Yes. Later. But I meant I'm glad you're here
 because I want to talk to you. About work. About the
 crime-scene photos of the second victim that were
 posted on the Net. There's something a little wrong
 with them.'</p>

<p>Michael Hill stood up. 'Well, if we're going to talk
 shop, there's a little bar I found. I thought we could
 go there for a drink first, before the ruby? Bit quieter
 than here.'</p>

<p>Sally looked down at his feet as she stood up. 'New
 boots?'</p>

<p>Michael Hill looked down at his snakeskin cowboy
 boots, polished to a gleam, and smiled as he admired
 them, stroking his black shoestring tie as he did so.
 'Fairly new, yes.'</p>

<p>Sally looked at her watch again and then shrugged;
 if anybody could take care of himself, Jack Delaney
 certainly could. Besides, she had earned herself a bit
 of fun.</p>

<p>She stood up and gave Michael a quick kiss on the
 cheek. 'Come on then. Let's leave the peanut gallery
 to it.'</p>

<p>Sally headed for the door, Michael Hill put his
 hand to his cheek where Sally had brushed her lips,
 and then followed her, desire dancing in his eyes and
 the faintest of smiles quirking the corners of his
 mouth.</p>

<p>Diane Campbell was leaning against Jack Delaney's
 desk. Looking through the Filofax that Jimmy
 Skinner had just brought back from the flat in
 Mornington Crescent. Kate Walker, meanwhile, was
 working at Sally's computer going over the forensics
 reports on both the dead women. 'So Jennifer Cole's
 real name is Katherine Wingrove.'</p>

<p>Jimmy Skinner nodded, a gesture on his tall thin
 body somewhat akin to an albatross dipping for
 food. 'She was a midwife at the South Hampstead
 Hospital, and did escorting work on the side. The
 first victim, Maureen Casey but calling herself Janet
 Barnes, was a student nurse, also at the South
 Hampstead, about eighteen months ago. According
 to Katherine Wingrove's diary, she had been
 working in prostitution since she was fifteen years
 old and had come to London as a runaway from
 domestic abuse. She wanted to qualify as a nurse,
 put that life behind her, but found she couldn't.
 Student bills to pay, debt mounting up. Katherine
 Wingrove helped her out, showed her the classier
 end of the trade. She gave up the nursing and took
 up escorting full-time.'</p>

<p>'Why did nobody recognise them at the hospital?'</p>

<p>'They look completely different, with the make-up
 and clothes on. Katherine Wingrove was on
 scheduled holiday this week so no one was expecting
 to see her anyway. And Maureen's own mother took
 some time to come forward she looked so different.'</p>

<p>'Either way it's not about prostitution, it's about
 the hospital. All three of his victims have worked
 there at some time.'</p>

<p>Kate typed in the address that Melanie Jones had
 given the police, truecrimeways.com. It opened on to
 a general site detailing true crimes, murders of a
 particularly brutal and violent nature. On the sixth
 page was a picture of a gravestone, at the bottom of
 a long article about Fred West. Following the
 instructions they had been given, Kate clicked on the
 cross at the top of the gravestone. A box appeared
 requesting a password.</p>

<p>Skinner watched what she was doing. 'It's just a
 like the paedophiles, hiding hyperlinks within a
 seemingly legal site. You need to know where it is
 and a password to get into the specialised area.' He
 said the word 'specialised' with a definite curl to his
 lip.</p>

<p>'And people actually pay money to look at these
 pictures?' Kate asked the room in general as crime-scene
 photos of the mutilated women appeared on
 the computer screen.</p>

<p>Diane shrugged. 'Kate, people pay a licence fee to
 watch <emphasis>Holby City</emphasis> at dinner time.'</p>

<p>Kate nodded, she had a good point. How close-ups
 of heart surgery, ribcages being cracked open and
 worse, had become evening family viewing on the
 BBC she had absolutely no idea.</p>

<p>'Can they be traced, whoever's putting up these
 pictures?'</p>

<p>Diane shrugged again. 'Paddington Green has their
 best technical people on it but they don't hold out
 much hope. Not of finding the guy who posted these
 pictures. Anyone can set up a bogus account, from an
 Internet cafe or a library. Hack into our systems,
 download the photos and put them up where they
 like. It can be impossible to trace.'</p>

<p>'Why lead us to it then?'</p>

<p>Diane rummaged in her handbag. 'Because we
 hadn't mentioned it to the press. These sad fucks
 need an audience, Kate. Pardon my fucking French.'</p>

<p>Kate sensed that Diane Campbell was hanging out
 for a cigarette. She was proved right as Diane found
 what she was looking for in her handbag, opened the
 window in front of Delaney's desk and lit one up.</p>

<p>Kate looked at the photos on the screen, pausing at
 one and then flicking through her files to look at the
 same photo in hard copy. She leaned in and peered at
 the computer screen when a voice behind her made
 her heart leap into her throat.</p>

<p>'You better have one of those for me, Diane.'</p>

<p>Kate spun round and jumped out of her chair. She
 didn't know whether to kiss him or slap him.</p>

<p>'Where have you been, Jack?'</p>

<p>'Christ, Delaney. You look like you've been run
 over by a combine harvester,' Diane Campbell added.</p>

<p>Delaney ran a hand over the rough stubble of his
 chin and nodded. 'I've had better days.'</p>

<p>Diane Campbell threw him a cigarette which he just
 about managed to catch with one hand. He leaned in
 for her to light it for him. 'Jimmy has identified the
 first two victims,' she told him. 'They both worked at
 the South Hampstead as did the third. The escorting
 isn't the link, it's the hospital itself.'</p>

<p>Kate pointed at the computer monitor. 'And
 there's something else. Look at this picture that was
 posted on the web. Sally Cartwright left me a note,
 something she'd picked up on. Asking me to check
 our forensic records.'</p>

<p>Diane walked round. 'What is it?'</p>

<p>'Look closely at this picture of the second victim.
 You can just about see the foot of the photographer
 reflected in the bit of mirror that the killer left.'</p>

<p>'And?'</p>

<p>Kate held up the photo from her file. 'And in this
 one you can't see anything. The mirror is clear, no
 reflection. No foot.'</p>

<p>Delaney shrugged. 'So? What does that mean?'</p>

<p>'The second is from our files and the first isn't. We
 don't have it. It means that whoever it was who put
 these pictures up on the Internet in the first place
 hasn't hacked into our files. Because that photo
 wasn't in our files in the first place.'</p>

<p>Diane nodded, taking it in. 'So that means—'</p>

<p>'Christ!' Delaney interrupted her as the implications
 hit him. 'Where's Sally Cartwright?'</p>

<p>Skinner ran a hand over his head. 'She said she had
 a hot date tonight.'</p>

<p>'Michael Hill.'</p>

<p>'That's right,' Skinner answered him. 'Danny Vine
 wasn't too happy about it, been moaning all
 afternoon.'</p>

<p>'Who's Michael Hill?' Kate asked, puzzled by their
 tone.</p>

<p>'He's the scene-of-crime photographer, Kate. He
 took those pictures and if there is one on that site
 that isn't on our files then he took that one too, and
 made a mistake when he was putting them up on the
 Net.'</p>

<p>Diane stabbed her cigarette in the air. 'We've got
 the bastard then.'</p>

<p>Delaney shook his head angrily. 'Not yet we
 haven't.'</p>

<p>Kate Walker stood up. 'For Christ's sake, Jack. Are
 you telling me he's got Sally?'</p>

<p>'He doesn't know we're on to him. There's no need
 to panic.'</p>

<p>Diane Campbell shook her head. 'He's been
 playing games with you all along.'</p>

<p>'It doesn't fit the pattern, Diane. She never worked
 at the hospital.'</p>

<p>'And what if she mentions what she asked Kate to
 look into?'</p>

<p>Delaney didn't answer her, what colour left in it
 was draining from his face.</p>

<p>Jessica Tam smiled at the sour-faced receptionist as
 she headed for the exit but, as usual, got nothing in
 response. The woman had been working there long
 enough to recognise most people by now, but there
 was no sign of it on her stony face. Maybe she
 reserved the smiles for the doctors and consultants, in
 that regard she wouldn't be unlike many others that
 worked at the South Hampstead. Seemed to her that
 if you didn't like people, being a receptionist wasn't
 exactly the best job in the world. Jessica loved people,
 loved helping people in need, and for her nursing
 wasn't just a job, it truly was a vocation. Shame it
 didn't pay any better, though, she couldn't help
 thinking as she stepped out into the cold car park not
 at all surprised to see it was raining again. Be nice to
 be able to save up enough to buy a better car. One
 that had heating that worked properly, that didn't
 steam up every time in wet weather. One that would
 start first time in the winter. She looked up at the sky
 above her, far too dark for this time of year. It was
 nights like these she wished her paternal grandfather
 hadn't come all that way and fallen in love with an
 English barmaid. Mind you, if he hadn't come to
 England, she thought with a little wry smile, she
 wouldn't have been born.</p>

<p>She slipped her handbag off her shoulder and
 fumbled for her car keys, thinking to herself that her
 car might be a bit of a heap, but at least she didn't
 have to walk across the common and through the
 heath. She shuddered thinking of the poor woman
 who had been found there and said a silent prayer for
 her colleague Mr Collins who was probably one of
 the nicest registrars she had ever worked with. A
 loving father, a kind and generous man. She couldn't
 even begin to imagine why anyone would want to
 hurt him. Her hands shook slightly as she tried to fit
 the key in the car door and fumbling she dropped
 them to the ground. She bent over and startled
 slightly as a man stepped up from behind her and
 snatched them up from the ground. She looked up a
 little scared, but then smiled, relieved, as she saw who
 it was.</p>

<p>'Dr Archer. You startled me.'</p>

<p>Paul Archer smiled back at her, his brown eyes
 almost black in the gloom of the poorly lit car park.
 'Then for that I do apologise. I really must make it up
 to you in some way.'</p>

<p>Jessica Tam held her hand out for her keys and
 Paul Archer smiled once more.</p>

<p>Some pleasures are to be savoured. Michael Hill
 thought. Some to be played out over time, like a symphony.
 But some morsels you want to rush at, devour
 and move on to the next.</p>

<p>He looked at the blonde woman, dressed only in
 her underwear, one hand hanging from a manacle. At
 the moment she was unconscious, but she would be
 awake soon enough. Would he do her quickly like the
 others, or would he leave her for a while? She wasn't
 part of the original plan but then she had made
 herself part of it, wrote herself into a leading role
 when she was only supposed to be a supporting
 extra. Jack Delaney's eager-eyed sidekick, lusting
 after the Irishman like the rest of them. Asking
 questions, beavering away, keen to get on the arrogant
 prick's good side. She had asked one question
 too many, however, and the thought of how Delaney
 was going to react to what was going to happen to
 her . . . well, that was just going to make it all the
 more enjoyable. He smiled at the prospect and then
 collected himself, he needed to focus, there was other
 work to do first. He went to the side table and picked
 up a dark, curly-haired wig and put it on. Looking at
 himself in the mirror on the wall he smiled again. The
 perfect disguise. Jack Delaney, eat your heart out.
 'Hey, cowboy. Time to ride,' he said out loud.</p>

<p>A coughed laugh behind him made him spin round.</p>

<p>'You're really pathetic, you know that? You're not
 a tenth the man he is.'</p>

<p>Michael Hill spun round and shook his head
 angrily. 'The way I see it, one of us looks pathetic,
 but it isn't me.'</p>

<p>Sally grimaced as she tried to loosen the manacle
 on her wrist.</p>

<p>'Hurts, doesn't it?' He held up his right wrist. 'I
 should know. My aunt used to hang me from the
 manacle and beat me when I was a child.'</p>

<p>'That's a tattoo, Michael.'</p>

<p>'Shut up!' he barked angrily at her and slapped her.</p>

<p>'And you never lived with your aunt as a child.'</p>

<p>'You don't know anything about me.'</p>

<p>Sally fought to keep her voice level, she had read
 the books at college. She knew that people like him
 got off on fear. It was all about power and control.
 The moment she showed herself as weak, the
 moment he smelled her fear, was the moment she was
 lost. 'I'm a detective, dickhead. I don't just go out on
 dates with men without finding out about them first.
 Your parents died when you were ten years old and
 your twenty-one-year-old sister took custody of you
 because your aunt was registered blind.'</p>

<p>'I told you to shut up!' He raised his hand as if to
 slap her again but then dropped it, his voice almost a
 whisper. 'You don't know anything about me.'</p>

<p>Sally softened her own voice. 'I know that you're
 scared, Michael. But it's not too late. You can put a
 stop to this. You can get help.' Her eyes pleaded with
 him. 'Let me help you.'</p>

<p>Hill walked across to the table again and picked up
 a length of cloth, then stepped forward and tied the
 cloth round her mouth. He leaned in and whispered
 in her ear. 'I've someone to take care of first. But I'll
 be back for you. Then we'll see who's scared.'</p>

<p>Sally twisted her head away, the feel of his moist
 breath in her ear far worse than the slap he had given
 her.</p>

<p>He headed to the corner of the cellar and up the
 steps. Sally stared at him defiantly until the small
 square of light disappeared as he closed the hatch
 above.</p>

<p>Sally howled with rage as best she could through
 the tight gag, then slumped against the wall. Her eyes
 scared now, filling with tears as fought to keep
 control of her bladder. She wasn't sure she had done
 the right thing provoking him, but she knew one
 thing: if she was going to die it wasn't going to be
 without a fight. After a few minutes working her jaw
 she managed to loosen the gag, enough to shout for
 help, but as her voice echoed in the thick walls of the
 cellar she realised it was a futile exercise. No one was
 ever going to hear her. She twisted her wrist once
 more, grunting with pain and desperation as she tried
 to slide her hand through the manacle.</p>

<p>And failed.</p>

<p>Delaney hung up the phone and shook his head. 'He's
 not at home.' An army of flak-jacketed officers had
 descended on Michael Hill's flat. But there was no
 sign either of him or Sally Cartwright.</p>

<p>Diane lit up another cigarette. 'He may not be
 meaning to hurt her.' But her voice betrayed her true
 feelings.</p>

<p>Kate walked across from the printer. 'This is a list
 of everyone working at the South Hampstead over
 the last year. And the smaller list is ones who have all
 at one time worked with the three victims so far.'</p>

<p>Delaney scanned the small list – names, addresses
 and phone numbers – and two of the names jumped
 out at him straight away: Paul Archer and Jessica
 Tam. Jessica had been one of the team who had
 fought so desperately to save his wife's life. He
 remembered her genuine grief that they hadn't been
 able to save either of them. He remembered her kind
 words, her genuine solicitude. He remembered her
 small, delicate body, her almost oriental features.
 Most of all he remembered her gentle smile and her
 humanity. And then he remembered what had been
 done to the other two women.</p>

<p>He snatched up the phone, looked at the list and
 punched in a number. It rang for a while before it
 was answered.</p>

<p>'South Hampstead Hospital.'</p>

<p>'Can I speak to Jessica Tam please?'</p>

<p>'She's off shift, I'm sorry. You've missed her.' The
 voice at the other end of the line was curt.</p>

<p>Delaney hung up and looked at the list again. She
 didn't live far from the hospital. He dialled her home
 number, it rang for a while but there was no answer.
 He stood up and hunched as best he could into his
 jacket.</p>

<p>'Come on, Kate. You can drive.'</p>

<p>'Let uniform deal, Jack,' Diane Campbell said, a
 warning tone in her voice. 'You are in no fit
 condition to do anything.'</p>

<p>'I can't just sit here, boss. By the time we get there
 she'll be home.'</p>

<p>'He's right, Diane,' Kate said as she stood up and
 put her own coat on.</p>

<p>Campbell sighed and lit another cigarette, calling
 out from her perch by the window as they walked to
 the door. 'Jack . . .'</p>

<p>'Yes.'</p>

<p>'Just be fucking careful.'</p>

<p>Jessica Tam fought desperately to stay awake as the
 man above looked down at her with the cold smile of
 an executioner.</p>

<p>It had all happened so quickly: she had opened her
 door, hardly registering the dark-haired man
 standing there before he had moved quickly forward,
 there was a sharp prick in her neck and her legs had
 gone rubbery beneath her. Unable even to speak she
 had been bustled back into her house, the door
 kicked closed behind them, and she was laid on her
 couch. As the man looked at his watch, like an
 anaesthetist waiting for a sedative to take hold, she
 knew all too well what was going to happen next if
 she lost consciousness; she could see it in the absolute
 chill of his eyes. If she could just fight it. Keep awake,
 then there was hope. But she could almost feel the
 rhythm of her heart slowing. She tried to lift her
 head, but it felt as if a sandbag had been placed over
 it. Maybe it had. Her eyes flickered open very
 slightly, she tried to seize the light, draw herself up
 along it. But she just felt so tired. So very, very tired.
 Her eyes closed again and she half formed the
 thought to fight it, to open them again, and then the
 thought died.</p>

<p>Kate pulled her car behind a Land Rover parked on
 pavement outside the nurse's house, and cut the
 engine.</p>

<p>'You wait here, Kate,' Delaney said.</p>

<p>'I'm coming with you. No arguments.'</p>

<p>Delaney shrugged and regretted it immediately as
 spikes of pain shot through his battered shoulders.
 They got out of the car and walked towards the
 house. Delaney looked through the back windows of
 a blue Transit van that was parked outside, but he
 couldn't make anything out, the windows were too
 deeply tinted.</p>

<p>Inside, Michael Hill couldn't believe his eyes as he
 crouched low and looked through the window. Jack
 Delaney and his bitch of a girlfriend walking towards
 the door. How the hell had he tracked him down?
 The man had the detecting skills of a blind goose. So
 far everything had had to be laid out on a plate for
 him. He hefted Jessica Tam under one arm and lifted
 the tranquilliser gun, which he had reloaded, in the
 other. There was nowhere to go. He pointed the gun
 at the door and waited.</p>

<p>The doorbell rang. He stayed motionless. It rang
 again. He could hear Delaney move around the side of
 the house, peering in the windows, but he wasn't
 visible in the hall. The bell rang a third time. He held
 the nurse tighter to him, grateful that she was so small.</p>

<p>After another couple of minutes he heard footsteps
 moving away. Then a car engine starting up and the
 car pulling away. He let out the breath he had
 unconsciously been holding and propped his arm
 under Jessica Tam and around her waist. Walking
 her to the door as if she had had too much too drink.</p>

<p>He opened the door and manoeuvred her clumsily
 towards his vehicle. He was halfway there when
 Delaney stepped around from the side of the van and
 pointed a pistol at him.</p>

<p>'Your exhaust pipe is still hot.'</p>

<p>Michael Hill stiffened, holding the gun against the
 petite nurse's head.</p>

<p>'I'll kill her.'</p>

<p>Delaney looked at the man's curly brown wig.
 Could see the madness dancing in his dark eyes. He
 had no doubt at all that he meant what he said.</p>

<p>'You pull that trigger and you're a dead man.'</p>

<p>'Maybe I'm a dead man anyway. But we're not
 finished here yet. I'm a force of nature, Delaney.'</p>

<p>Delaney looked at him and wondered at his own
 hesitation. Earlier that day he had been unable to kill
 a man responsible for the death of his wife and the
 death of his unborn baby. Something in him had
 changed, that much was clear. A couple of months
 ago he wouldn't have hesitated. He'd have put a
 bullet in each of Mickey Ryan's kneecaps first and
 then put one in his head. He looked at the frail
 woman who had tried so hard to help him all those
 years ago. He was powerless. He looked at the
 expression in the man's eyes facing him. He took a
 step closer, saw the pupils grow wider as though the
 man had come to some kind of decision. He moved
 slowly towards the man, positioning the barrel of the
 gun in the centre of his forehead.</p>

<p>'Drop the gun, Michael.'</p>

<p>'Look into my eyes, Delaney. You know I'll do it.'</p>

<p>Delaney looked in his eyes and then pulled the
 trigger. Michael Hill's head snapped back in a way
 the spine wasn't designed for. His dark brown wig
 fell off and as he crashed to the floor with his arms
 held out, his head landed with a wet, slapping thud,
 jolting one of the brown contact lenses he was
 wearing loose. He now had one brown eye and one
 blue and looked, Delaney thought, with his blond
 hair and white face exactly as David Bowie might
 have looked if he had carried on with the heroin.</p>

<p>The nurse, Jessica Tam, had fallen from his lifeless
 arms and was now laid across his body in an
 unnaturally intimate manner.</p>

<p>Delaney barely registered the sound of car tyres as
 Kate pulled back into the driveway. He picked the
 nurse up in his arms and carried her over to the car.
 Kate opened the door for him to lay her on the back
 seat and then leaned over her to check her vital signs.
 She put a finger on her carotid artery and then bent
 over to listen to her breathing.</p>

<p>'She's got a strong, steady rhythm, Jack. She's
 going to be fine. Just drugged, that's all.' She looked
 over at dead figure of Michael Hill and shuddered.
 'Are you okay?'</p>

<p>Delaney looked down at his hand, which was
 trembling now and nodded. 'I'm fine.'</p>

<p>He pulled out his phone, and turned his back to
 shield himself from the wind as he made a call.</p>

<p>'Jimmy, it's Jack. I've got Michael Hill. He's dead.
 He had a gun. We struggled. He lost.'</p>

<p>'Glad to hear it.'</p>

<p>'Don't be too glad. He didn't tell me where Sally
 Cartwright is.'</p>

<p>'I've got another address, Jack. One from his
 original application. His aunt's. She died recently.'</p>

<p>'Where is it?'</p>

<p>'About a quarter of a mile from where you are.
 Priory Road. Number thirty-two.'</p>

<p>'Put it out. I'll make my way there. And get an
 ambulance sent over here.'</p>

<p>'You reckon he needs it?'</p>

<p>'It's for the nurse. At least we saved one of them.'</p>

<p>Delaney walked over to the Michael Hill's supine
 body. He took the tranquilliser gun off him and put
 it in his pocket. Then wiped his own gun and put the
 dead man's hand over the grip of the gun, fitting his
 finger in the trigger guard. He squeezed the dead
 man's hand a couple of times and then used it to
 throw the gun on the floor about three feet away.</p>

<p>He walked back to Kate. 'You didn't see any of that.
 We struggled. His gun went off.' He ran his fingers
 through his hair, realising his hands were still
 trembling and there was nothing he could do to stop it.</p>

<p>Kate stepped forward and hugged him. 'You can't
 save everyone, Jack.'</p>

<p>Delaney kissed the top of her head. 'I can try.'</p>

<p>Kate looked up at him and ran her hand over his
 unshaven face. 'What am I going to do with you?'</p>

<p>'I've got to go. The ambulance and the others
 won't be long. Will you be all right waiting here?'</p>

<p>'Just find Sally, Jack.' She kissed him. 'And be
 careful.'</p>

<p>Delaney nodded at the body. 'He's dead, Kate.'</p>

<p>They're both dead, he thought, as he walked off
 into the wind and rain not daring to let himself
 believe that Sally Cartwright was still alive.</p>

<p>Michael Hill's aunt may have only been dead a short
 while but her house had already been stripped of
 furniture; a painted dresser in the kitchen, a bed in
 one of the upstairs bedrooms, some old clothes
 hanging in a musty wardrobe. But nothing apart
 from that. Just dust and damp.</p>

<p>Delaney toured the rooms once again to see if he
 had missed anything. But he hadn't. The house was
 empty.</p>

<p>He pushed the front door shut and leaned against
 the porch wall; using his body to shield against the
 wind, he lit a cigarette. He took a deep drag and
 played back in his mind what Michael Hill had said
 before he shot him. He was a force of nature, he'd
 said. And before that he said he wasn't finished. No.
 He hadn't. His exact words were 'We're not
 finished'. The women being mutilated, the man not.
 The whole Jack the Ripper nonsense. 'We.' He cursed
 as he fumbled for his phone.</p>

<p>We. There were two of them.</p>

<p>'Shit!'</p>

<p>Detective Inspector Robert Duncton of the serious
 crimes unit thundered up the stairs, the men behind
 running to keep up. Half of them were in flak jackets
 and armed. He got to the top of the stairs and walked
 along the external corridor. He was not in a good
 mood. White City had been pissing all over his
 investigation again. Little men trying to play with the
 big boys. One of them, Jack Delaney, had just shot
 dead the prime suspect and was now claiming that
 Michael Hill was acting with a partner. That there
 were two of them. If they had made a mistake in
 letting the first one go it was the sort of thing that
 could wreck a promising career. And Robert
 Duncton's career was very promising indeed. At least
 it had been up until today.</p>

<p>He waited for two of the armed officers to position
 themselves either side of the door and hammered on
 it with a fist as heavy as his heart.</p>

<p>Ashley Bradley's grandmother peered out. 'Can I
 help you?'</p>

<p>Duncton took her by the arms and moved her
 outside. 'Is he here?'</p>

<p>'Ashley?'</p>

<p>'Yes, Mrs Bradley. Is your son here?'</p>

<p>'No, he's not in right now. And he's my grandson.'</p>

<p>Duncton gestured and the armed men piled into
 the house. A few seconds later they emerged shaking
 their heads.</p>

<p>'I told you,' said Mrs Bradley.</p>

<p>Duncton sighed. 'Where is he, then?'</p>

<p>'He's gone to the cinema. Some film he wanted to
 see. He loves romantic films.'</p>

<p>Delaney jogged painfully back the way he had come
 and had to stop by a bus shelter to catch his breath.
 He leaned against it as he pulled out his packet of
 cigarettes, cursing at the awkwardness of only having
 one arm to use as he fumbled one into his mouth. A
 handsomely dressed middle-aged couple walked past,
 putting as much room between him and them as
 possible. Delaney didn't blame them. He used the flat
 of his hand to brush some of the dust from his
 trousers. He sneezed. He lit his cigarette and sneezed
 again. And then he realised, the cigarette almost
 falling from his mouth, but not quite. 'Idiot!' He
 almost shouted it.</p>

<p>The middle-aged couple ahead looked back, but
 Delaney didn't even register them. He began running
 back towards the house he had left just five minutes
 previously. Running in real earnest now.</p>

<p>Ashley did like romantic films. Quite often in the
 early screenings it meant there was a fair scattering of
 women in the audience. Single women who didn't
 want to come later and feel jealous of the happy
 couples sitting all around them. Ashley could relate
 to that. He settled back and enjoyed the trailers. His
 overcoat was pulled lightly together, his jeans were
 unbuttoned beneath it and with a hole already cut in
 his right-hand pocket he was good to go.</p>

<p>While he had been sat there she had already eaten
 a hot dog and was now munching her way through a
 bin-sized bucket of popcorn. Not that he was objecting,
 he liked to hear women eat. He enjoyed listening
 to the wet sounds her lips made as they slapped
 together, the little, almost inaudible groans of
 pleasure as she swallowed.</p>

<p>He gave himself a little preparatory stroke. The
 next trailer was for a Sandra Bullock film. Ashley
 Bradley was a big fan of Sandra Bullock. Had been
 ever since <emphasis>Demolition Man</emphasis>, when she ran around in
 her tight black pants and futuristic cop outfit. Ashley
 had had a really bad couple of days and he figured he
 deserved a treat. And treats didn't come much better
 than Sandra Bullock in tight clothing. He closed his
 eyes for a moment, picturing her in her uniform,
 when the sound of men running loudly down the
 gently sloping aisle made him snap them open again.</p>

<p>Robert Duncton and four of his men stopped
 opposite Bradley's seat, fanning out, two of them
 training semi-automatic pistols at him.</p>

<p>'Get him.'</p>

<p>The other two leaned in and yanked him up. His
 coat flew open, his jeans dropped, and his penis,
 semi-priapic, twisted and scarred, wagged in the
 direction of the woman sitting next to him.</p>

<p>She looked at it, screamed and promptly threw up.</p>

<p>Ashley's day wasn't getting any better.</p>

<p>Nor was Detective Inspector Robert Duncton from
 Paddington Green's. 'Get him out of here,' he
 shouted, stepping back and wiping some of the
 splatter from his once immaculate trousers.</p>

<p>Delaney pushed open the front door that he had
 earlier forced and walked in again, listening for any
 sounds, but there were none. He flicked the light on
 and walked down to the kitchen. He turned the light
 on in the kitchen and looked at the floor. It was as
 clean as he remembered it. Too clean. There was no
 dust on it. He walked across to the dresser that was
 positioned in the far corner opposite the sink and
 leaned against the wall at a diagonal. He put his
 hands either side of the base unit and pulled. It was
 sitting on a rug and came away surprisingly easy. He
 pulled it a little further out and looked behind it.
 There was a trap door.</p>

<p>Bingo.</p>

<p>He bent down, put his finger through the ring and
 pulled it open and called out.</p>

<p>'Sally.'</p>

<p>'Sir, you can't come down here.'</p>

<p>'It's all right, Sally, it's just me.'</p>

<p>Delaney took off his jacket and walked down the
 stairs.</p>

<p>'You can't see me like this.'</p>

<p>'I can't see a thing,' said Delaney. 'It's like the
 black hole of Calcutta down here.'</p>

<p>'Don't mention Indian restaurants.'</p>

<p>Delaney could hear the fragility behind her laugh,
 he reached out with his jacket and she managed to
 drape it around her shoulders. Delaney went back to
 the bottom of the stairs and fumbled for the light
 switch. He found and turned it on; a bare bulb flared
 up overhead. It was a small wine cellar. Empty apart
 from a side table, a mirror and his young assistant
 who was manacled to the wall, her arm raised like an
 overeager child with the answer to a difficult
 question in class.</p>

<p>'Did he hurt you, Sally?'</p>

<p>She shook her head. 'He took me to another bar
 for a drink. He must have slipped something in it,
 because I remember feeling suddenly woozy and I
 hadn't drunk that much. He said he'd drive me home.
 The last thing I can remember is getting into his car.
 And then I passed out.'</p>

<p>Delaney took a hold of the ring set into the wall
 with his one good hand and tried pulling it. It
 wouldn't budge. He managed to loosen the manacle
 a little, but not enough for Sally to free her hand.</p>

<p>'Don't worry, Sally, we'll get you out.'</p>

<p>'Michael Hill, sir. Did he hurt anyone else?'</p>

<p>'No, and he's not going to hurt anyone again. He's
 dead.'</p>

<p>'Good!'</p>

<p>Delaney nodded. She was right. He headed back to
 the steps. 'I'm going upstairs to find something to get
 you free with.'</p>

<p>Delaney walked up the stairs and into the kitchen
 and stopped dead as he saw the rifle pointing at him.</p>

<p>He looked at the person holding it and held his
 hands up. She looked familiar to him but he couldn't
 place her at first. And then he did. She was the
 receptionist at the South Hampstead Hospital. She
 wasn't smiling.</p>

<p>'Put the rifle down,' he said.</p>

<p>The woman smiled and there was poison in it. 'I
 don't think so.'</p>

<p>'Who are you?'</p>

<p>'Not that it's going to matter to you, but my name
 is Audrey Hill.'</p>

<p>Delaney nodded. 'Michael Hill, he's your
 husband?'</p>

<p>'No, Detective Delaney. He's my baby brother. I
 brought him up.'</p>

<p>'You know who I am then?'</p>

<p>'I know exactly who you are.'</p>

<p>'And you knew what your brother was doing?'</p>

<p>'He didn't do anything, Detective. He never does
 without my permission . . .' She looked at Delaney
 with flat eyes, and he felt a chill run up his spine.
 'Not any more.'</p>

<p>Delaney swallowed drily, his mind racing, running
 through the options. He wasn't thinking so much
 about himself, he was thinking about the young,
 near-naked detective constable chained to the wall in
 the cellar beneath them. He had to keep her talking,
 he had to keep this madwoman away from her. He
 didn't know what he was going to do but he knew
 this much, she stopped talking and it was over for
 him. Over for both of them.</p>

<p>'Why then, Audrey?'</p>

<p>She moved closer to Delaney, her unblinking eyes
 staring at him like a entomologist might examine a
 newly discovered specimen. 'Neither of them suffered.
 They were all painless deaths. Anaesthetised and then
 a simple cut to the jugular. They died in their sleep.'</p>

<p>'And the surgeon?'</p>

<p>The woman shrugged. 'We were disturbed. I'll get
 back to him later.'</p>

<p>'What had they done to you?'</p>

<p>Delaney tried to edge closer to her but she raised
 the rifle and shook her head very slightly. 'This is a
 tranquilliser rifle, but it's loaded for very large
 animals. It's hard to describe the damage it would do
 to a human central nervous system.'</p>

<p>Delaney held up his hands, calming. 'Why did you
 kill them, Audrey?'</p>

<p>'Because of what they did to me.'</p>

<p>'What?'</p>

<p>'Were you aware that one in seven hundred people
 wake up during an operation under general
 anaesthetic, Detective?' she said.</p>

<p>Delaney wasn't. 'No,' he replied.</p>

<p>'You're paralysed, immobile, you can't move. Not
 even an eyelid. But you can feel. Feel the cold steel of
 the scalpel slicing into you. Feel your flesh parting as
 they open you up.'</p>

<p>Delaney didn't respond, it was putting it mildly to
 say that he already had a very bad feeling about this
 woman, he knew what she was capable of, after all.
 He could feel the anger and sickness radiating off her
 like the shimmering haze of a tarmac road in a
 heatwave.</p>

<p>Audrey Hill took another step closer to him. 'You
 can hear too, Detective Inspector. And that's the
 worst part of it. They were talking, the two sluts
 whispering to each other about clients they'd fucked.
 The surgeon talking about football to the vapid
 nurse. Talk, talk talk, When they should have been
 concentrating on what they were doing. The
 anaesthetist spotted something was wrong and put
 me under again, but by then it was too late.'</p>

<p>'I can understand it must have been a terrible
 experience—'</p>

<p>'You understand nothing!' She spat the words at
 him, the rifle shaking in her hands for the first time
 as her hands shook with fury.'</p>

<p>'They killed our baby.'</p>

<p>'What do you mean?'</p>

<p>'What do you think I mean? Our baby died!'</p>

<p>'Yours and Michael's?'</p>

<p>'We were a family. We were supposed to be a
 family. They took that away from us.'</p>

<p>Delaney looked at the rifle trembling in her hands,
 and held his hand up again, trying to keep the disgust
 from his face and voice. 'It's okay.'</p>

<p>'Nothing is okay. It was supposed to be routine but
 they made a mistake with the anaesthetic and had to
 deliver my baby by Caesarean section. I heard them!'</p>

<p>Delaney could see the madness and rage still
 dancing in her eyes. 'That must have been terrible for
 you.'</p>

<p>'He died because of their butchery. Then they
 performed a hysterectomy. Performed it without my
 consent.'</p>

<p>'They were trying to help you.'</p>

<p>'No.' Her voice was quiet now and Delaney didn't
 feel more reassured by it, in fact he felt the opposite.
 'I am a trained veterinary nurse by trade, not a
 receptionist. I took that job just to get close to them,
 Detective. So I understand surgery. I heard them
 admit their mistakes. They murdered my baby and
 then they cut out my womb. So that's why, Detective.
 A life for a life.'</p>

<p>'And the mutilations? Did they deserve that?'</p>

<p>She smiled joylessly again. 'It's what they did to
 me.' Her eyes dropped to her stomach and the smile
 fell from her lips. 'They mutilated me.'</p>

<p>Delaney could hear the change in the tone of her
 voice. As if their conversation was at an end. He had
 to say something. Do something.</p>

<p>Audrey Hill raised the rifle a fraction, pointing at
 his heart now, as if she had come to a decision. 'Do
 you believe in God, Inspector?'</p>

<p>Delaney shrugged. 'Yeah I do. Someone has to be
 responsible for all this shite.'</p>

<p>She didn't smile this time. 'Now that we know how
 big the universe really is . . .' She shook her head
 puzzled. 'How can you believe in God? We're not
 ants. Were not even germs. So if there is no justice
 from God, we have to make our own, don't we?'</p>

<p>'It doesn't have to be like this.'</p>

<p>'It already is, Detective Inspector Delaney.'</p>

<p>Delaney heart thudded in his chest as he heard a
 familiar voice shout out.</p>

<p>'Jack,' Kate called from the front door. 'Are you in
 there?'</p>

<p>'Stay back!' Delaney shouted, almost screamed it.
 'Just stay where you are.'</p>

<p>'Jack!'</p>

<p>Kate walked into the room and as Audrey Hill
 spun round and pointed the rifle at her, she froze in
 place.</p>

<p>'Maybe I'll just shoot her then.'</p>

<p>Delaney saw her hand trembling on the trigger, the
 madness in her eyes and stepped forward. Kate
 Walker was the woman he loved. He knew that now
 more than ever. He loved her and she was carrying
 his child. He wasn't going to lose another one.
 'Jessica Tam isn't dead and Michael isn't bringing her
 here,' he said.</p>

<p>'What are you talking about?'</p>

<p>'I killed him. Michael's dead.'</p>

<p>The woman shook her head, shocked, as she spun
 round and trained the rifle back on him. 'You're
 lying!'</p>

<p>Delaney took another step towards her. 'I put a
 bullet in his diseased brain, Audrey. He's dead, it's
 over. Now put down the rifle.'</p>

<p>Delaney watched her hands tremble. He didn't
 know if it was a deliberate tightening of her finger on
 the trigger as the rifle fired, or if it was accidental. He
 didn't register the sound of Kate screaming, he didn't
 know that Sally Cartwright had come charging into
 the room and was throwing herself at Audrey Hill.</p>

<p>Falling to the floor, he didn't know anything at all.</p>

<p>He was already dead.</p>

<empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p><strong>EPILOGUE</strong></p>

<p>When she was seven years old Kate Walker had
 attended her grandmother's funeral. It was a bitterly
 cold day in October, and, as she had stood in the rain
 in her black coat and her black skirt with a black hat
 on her head that did nothing to stop the swirling bite
 of the wind, she had decided she didn't like funerals
 or cemeteries. Why couldn't people live for ever?
 Why couldn't she be seven for ever? Why do people
 have to grow up and die?</p>

<p>Maybe, at heart, that was why she had become a
 pathologist. Maybe she chose her career to answer
 that question. As a young boy will break apart a
 favourite toy to try and see how it works, maybe she
 had been breaking apart human bodies. Dissecting
 and disassembling them to their component parts,
 flesh, tissue, sinew and blood, to answer the question
 that, outside religion, had no answer. She had learned
 that as a child Michael Hill had killed and tortured
 animals, for the same reason, before his sickness had
 been identified and he had been put on medication.
 Medication his abusive sister had later withheld from
 him. Had she, herself, been doing the same thing all
 this time, Kate wondered, only with dead human
 bodies? Maybe she was a lot more like him than she
 realised. She shivered. She was nothing like Michael
 Hill. She was alive, for one thing.</p>

<p>She shivered because it was cold that day as well.
 Not as bitterly cold as the day of her grandmother's
 funeral, but the wind had an edge like a scalpel and
 Kate put her right hand around the folds of her scarf
 and pulled it tight to her throat. It was a cashmere
 scarf, white, and she found comfort in the warmth of
 its touch. She never thought she would buy a
 coloured scarf ever again.</p>

<p>She looked down at the gravestones. At the surname
 DELANEY carved twice in bold chisel strokes.</p>

<p>She still didn't know why people had to die. In all
 her years of medical training she hadn't even come
 close to knowing. She only knew that people did. The
 important thing to do, she had decided, if you were
 living, was to live.</p>

<p>Jack Delaney had come back to life in more ways
 than one. She took her hand from her scarf, took his
 hand in her own and squeezed it.</p>

<p>He looked at her and smiled sadly and she had
 never felt more alive. She remembered the confusion
 of that evening. Delaney collapsing to the floor. His
 body in such a bad state, after the battering he had
 taken over the previous few days, that his heart
 had literally given out at the massive dose of
 tranquilliser shot into him. He claimed that he knew
 that Kate would have her medical bag with her in
 the car, and, moreover, as he knew that the surgical
 registrar James Collins had survived over night,
 after being shot with the same drug, he was going to
 be fine. But Kate didn't believe him. He knew the
 risk he had been taking, but he took it anyway. He
 deliberately goaded the woman into shooting him
 because she was threatening me, Kate thought, and
 threatening the life of our unborn baby. Kate
 couldn't remember the words she mumbled as she
 stabbed the adrenalin shot into his lifeless heart, but
 it was a prayer of some kind. And in those few
 moments between life and death her own heart
 almost stopped itself as the world tilted on its axis
 once more for Delaney and he breathed again.
 Opening his eyes and smiling with them at her as
 though reborn.</p>

<p>She looked back down at the gravestones of his
 wife and son and realised she could never tell Jack the
 terrible truth about the boy. That when the baby had
 been born it had needed blood; the surgical team had
 checked automatically but Jack Delaney was not a
 match.</p>

<p>He wasn't a match because he hadn't been the
 father.</p>

<p>Jack knelt down on one knee, laid some flowers on
 his wife's grave, stayed there for a moment, then stood
 up and put his arm around Kate's waist. 'Let's go.'</p>

<p>They walked back towards the cemetery gates.
 Jack had told her that the man responsible for his
 wife's death was dead. He didn't provide any more
 details, nor yet did she ask for them. What she knew
 was that Jack Delaney was a new man. There was
 still a darkness at the heart of him but he had closed
 a chapter on his life and was ready to start a new one.
 A new one with her.</p>

<p>For the first time in her life she truly felt protected
 and she truly felt loved, the barriers she had fought so
 long to build were coming down.</p>

<p>That night they made love for the first time. It
 seemed.</p>

<p>It was three o'clock in the morning. Kate murmured
 drowsily, half awake, half asleep. She settled into her
 pillow and put her arm around Delaney's waist and
 then started, flashing to the morning she woke up
 with Paul Archer in her bed. But as she lay back on
 her pillow she remembered more; lowering her
 barriers had let Delaney truly into her life, but it also
 brought back memories, as though it was only now
 that she was strong enough to deal with them.</p>

<p><emphasis>She was quite drunk. Goodness knows how
 many vodkas she had had. She was dancing to
 another female singer now. She sang along and
 wobbled a bit. She sat down on the sofa.</emphasis></p>

<p><emphasis>'Ooops.'</emphasis></p>

<p><emphasis>Paul Archer stood up and reached for his
 jacket. 'I'd better be getting home.'</emphasis></p>

<p><emphasis>'Where do you live?'</emphasis></p>

<p><emphasis>'Finchley. I used to live down the road. My
 soon-to-be ex-wife has the house.' He shrugged
 with a smile. 'The bitch.'</emphasis></p>

<p><emphasis>She looked at her watch. 'It's too late. You'll
 never catch a taxi. Not at this time of night.'</emphasis></p>

<p><emphasis>'Then I'll walk.'</emphasis></p>

<p><emphasis>'To Finchley?! No!' She wagged a finger and
 was aware her words were slurred. And the
 more she tried to concentrate, the more slurred
 they seemed to become. 'You'll stay here. No
 funny business. But you might as well stay.'</emphasis></p>

<p><emphasis>Paul Archer smiled. He was a good-looking
 man, and she reckoned that smile had charmed
 the pants off plenty of women in the past. But all
 she wanted to do was go to bed and sleep for a
 week. She stood up and stumbled her way to the
 hall closet where she pulled out a duvet and
 handed it to him. 'The sofa is large enough to
 sleep on.' She knew that, because the last man she
 had given the duvet to was Jack bloody Delaney.
 'You sleep here and I'll see you in the morning.'</emphasis></p>

<p><emphasis>She went to her own bedroom, left her pile of
 clothes on the floor and climbed into bed. She
 looked at the ceiling for a moment or two, at
 least the room wasn't spinning. She turned off
 the light and a short while later she heard Paul
 Archer come into the room.</emphasis></p>

<p><emphasis>'It's cold out there. Can't I sleep with you?
 Like you say, no funny business, I promise.'</emphasis></p>

<p><emphasis>She couldn't remember speaking but she
 remembered shaking her head. And she
 remembered the sound of him taking off his
 clothes and climbing into bed and thinking what
 the hell, as long as he just went to sleep.</emphasis></p>

<p><emphasis>'You try anything,' she said, 'and you're out
 the door.' She remembered him leaning over her.
 Showing his left wrist which had a Celtic tattoo
 of a chain. He turned it around so she could see
 the chain was broken. 'See this. I had it done the
 day after my wife made me leave my house. It's
 a symbol of freedom. I used to have a watch on
 this wrist which she bought me. I sold that the
 same day as well. Ten thousand pounds. She was
 a passive bitch as well, but she warmed up when
 I taught her how.'</emphasis></p>

<p><emphasis>Kate's eyelids drooped. 'What are you
 saying?'</emphasis></p>

<p><emphasis>His voice was hard now. 'I'm saying it would
 be no fun fucking you like this. Like a drunken
 slut. But I want you to know that when I am
 ready</emphasis> . . . <emphasis>I will fuck you. And what you want
 will have nothing to do with it.'</emphasis></p>

<p><emphasis>She struggled, trying to tell him to get out, but
 she couldn't seem to speak and his voice became
 soft and soothing like melted molasses as he
 stroked her forehead.</emphasis></p>

<p><emphasis>He spoke some more but she couldn't
 remember the words, she couldn't make them
 out. It was like nonsense he was speaking. And
 she couldn't keep her eyes open. She felt herself
 falling as if into a deep chasm of sleep and then
 she remembered no more.</emphasis></p>

<p>Kate sat bolt upright in bed and reached for the
 telephone on the bedside cabinet, hurriedly dialling a
 number.</p>

<p>Delaney stirred and rubbed his eyes. 'What's going
 on?'</p>

<p>'Shush.'</p>

<p>The phone rang a few times and was picked up.
 The voice on the other end of the line far from
 pleased.</p>

<p>'This had better be good. Have you any idea what
 bloody time it is?'</p>

<p>'Jane, it's Kate.'</p>

<p>'Kate.' The sleepy voice on the other end of the line
 became more alert. 'What the hell's going on? Are
 you all right?'</p>

<p>'I'm fine. Just tell me . . . Paul Archer. He worked
 with children, you said?'</p>

<p>'Yes.'</p>

<p>'What specialty?'</p>

<p>'Paediatric psychology. Mainly in the area of
 trauma counselling.'</p>

<p>'Does he use hypnosis?'</p>

<p>'Yes, I think he does.'</p>

<p>'Son of a bitch.'</p>

<p>'Has something happened?'</p>

<p>Kate smiled. 'No. Nothing happened. That's
 exactly the point. I'll speak to you later.' She hung up
 the phone and smiled broadly at Jack. Then she
 realised something else.</p>

<p>'Oh, shit.' She almost whispered it.</p>

<p>Helen Archer looked up a little startled as Kate
 came into one of the rooms for witnesses at the
 courthouse. Her hand flew involuntarily to her
 mouth like a wounded bird as she bit on a fingernail.
 She willed her hand down. 'Sorry, I'm a bundle
 of nerves today.'</p>

<p>'I can understand,' said Kate.</p>

<p>'I nearly felt like not turning up. I'm not sure, when
 I see him, how I'm going to react. I'm not sure I can
 do it.'</p>

<p>'He's a forceful man. I don't blame you, Helen.'</p>

<p>'But he deserves to pay for what he's done, doesn't
 he?'</p>

<p>Kate looked at the woman, could see the nerves
 running through her body like electricity, making her
 twitch and fidget. 'When we talked earlier this week,
 you said he was wearing a watch. That night, when
 he attacked you . . . you said he was wearing the
 watch you bought him as an anniversary present?'</p>

<p>Helen Archer nodded, a little puzzled by the
 question. 'That's right. He always wore it. He didn't
 care about scratching me. About hurting me.'</p>

<p>'That was the same night?'</p>

<p>'What same night?'</p>

<p>'As the rape?'</p>

<p>Helen stood up and gestured with her trembling
 hands, agitated now. 'Yes, of course it was the same
 night! Why are you asking me that?'</p>

<p>'He told me he sold the watch, Helen.'</p>

<p>'When?'</p>

<p>'The day after he moved out of the house.'</p>

<p>'He's a liar. He's always been a liar. When did he
 tell you this?'</p>

<p>'The night he stayed at my place. I am getting some
 of the memory back. Flashes of it.'</p>

<p>'Are you saying you don't believe me?'</p>

<p>'What about his wrist, Helen? What can you tell
 me about his wrist?'</p>

<p>'There's nothing to tell. He had his watch on.' She
 shook her head angrily. 'I don't understand why you
 are talking like this.'</p>

<p>'Because he had his wrist tattooed, Helen. The day
 after he moved out of the house.'</p>

<p>'He's lying.'</p>

<p>'To me? At that time, why would he? You made no
 mention about his watch in your police statement. It
 was only to me you mentioned it and that was after
 he told me about the watch. Only I didn't remember
 at the time.'</p>

<p>Helen Archer seemed to slump, she sat back on the
 chair and looked up at Kate, pleading with her sad
 eyes. 'What if it didn't happen that night? Not that
 one time. But what if it happened a lot before, when
 we were married? Does that make him any less
 guilty?'</p>

<p>Kate sighed. 'I don't know, Helen.'</p>

<p>'What if he made my life a living hell?' Her voice
 was more strident now and she stood up again.
 'What if he phoned every day after he moved out?
 What if he kept leaving messages on the answerphone?
 Not threatening messages. Not anything you
 could take to the police. But I understood what he
 meant. I understood the subtext. With Paul it was his
 way, always. You didn't tell him it was over.'</p>

<p>Kate remembered the whispered words Paul
 Archer had said to her.</p>

<p>'So you set him up, you invited him over and let
 him have sex with you?' she asked.</p>

<p>Helen tore at her thumbnail. Her voice on the edge
 of manic. 'What are you going to do?'</p>

<p>'That was why there was no evidence of drugs,'
 said Kate. 'There never were any, were there?'</p>

<p>Helen looked at her, the desperation naked in her
 eyes. 'What are you going to do?' she said again.</p>

<p>But Kate couldn't answer her.</p>

<p>Back in the entrance foyer of the courthouse, Delaney
 stood up gratefully from the long wooden bench he
 had been sitting on as Kate approached. He could see
 how tense she was.</p>

<p>'What did she say?'</p>

<p>'She lied to me, Jack. She lied to everyone.'</p>

<p>'What are you going to do?'</p>

<p>'I have to do what's right. I'm going to have to
 testify. I'm an officer of the court.'</p>

<p>Kate Walker felt a tickle in the back of her throat.
 She coughed into her hand a little and realised she
 was sweating. She had been in court many times
 before, but this time felt different. She looked across,
 reassured to see Jack sitting in the public gallery. He
 gave her a smile. But she couldn't get the muscles in
 her face to smile back. She placed her hand on the
 Bible and promised to tell the truth, the whole truth
 and nothing but the truth.</p>

<p>'Can you tell us in your own words what happened
 that night?'</p>

<p>Kate blinked, she had been lost in thought and had
 missed most of what the barrister had been asking
 her.</p>

<p>She looked across at Paul Archer. He was sat with
 his arms folded, looking at her with a calm, self-assured
 expression.</p>

<p>'We had been drinking. I had been drinking quite a
 lot, in fact. It was late. It was cold and I thought it
 unlikely Dr Archer would flag down a cab easily.'</p>

<p>'And so?'</p>

<p>'And so I offered him the use of my sofa.'</p>

<p>'Your sofa?'</p>

<p>'Yes. Nothing else. Dr Archer took advantage of
 my hospitality by coming unbidden to my bedroom
 and climbing naked into my bed.'</p>

<p>'Are you saying he assaulted you?'</p>

<p>'He assaulted my hospitality. He assaulted all
 acceptable norms of behaviour.'</p>

<p>'But did he touch you?'</p>

<p>'Not then, but he made it very clear that he
 intended to . . .' she gestured apologetically to the
 jury, '. . . in his own words "fuck me" at a later stage
 and what I wanted would have nothing to do with it.'</p>

<p>She looked at the jury and back at Paul Archer
 before he had a chance to wipe that smug smile off
 his lips and she knew the jury had seen it too. 'He
 made it clear he liked his women to resist him, Your
 Honour. He left me in no doubt as to his intentions
 towards me.'</p>

<p>Archer's brief stood up. 'My client is not on trial
 for things he may be imagined to do in the future.'</p>

<p>Kate pointed at Helen Archer. 'He raped that poor
 woman.' She turned again to the jury. 'And he should
 be made to pay.'</p>

<p>Archer's barrister leapt to his feet again,
 summoning some outrage. 'I object, Your Honour.'</p>

<p>'Sustained,' said the judge. 'The jury will disregard
 that last remark.</p>

<p>Which was like telling a drowning man not to
 breathe in.</p>

<p>Delaney leaned against a lamp post. He lit a cigarette
 and wondered how long it would be before smoking
 was banned in all outdoor public places too. As it
 was you could be fined fifty pounds for flicking a fag
 end into a drain. But the law was the law, you had to
 respect it.</p>

<p>The sky overhead for once had a remarkable
 amount of blue in it, the soft white clouds that dotted
 here and there were motionless and the sun was
 actually shining. It was a bright, crisp, chill autumn
 day. An autumn day like it should be. As it was in his
 childhood, when the seasons knew how to behave
 themselves.</p>

<p>It was a day for new beginnings.</p>

<p>Kate came out of the courthouse, her smile, the
 epicentre now of Delaney's solar system, as bright as
 the sun itself.</p>

<p>'What happened?'</p>

<p>'He got seven years and four months.'</p>

<p>'You don't feel guilty?'</p>

<p>'Not a bit of it.'</p>

<p>Delaney nodded. 'A certain degree of moral
 flexibility allows us to do what we do.' He grinned
 and flicked his cigarette into the drain at his feet
 watching it spark as it hit the grating below.</p>

<p>'I didn't perjure myself, Jack, I just didn't tell them
 I knew Helen Archer was lying.'</p>

<p>At that moment the woman in question came out
 of the courthouse, she was surrounded by friends and
 family. She looked across at Kate and gave her a
 small, quick smile.</p>

<p>Delaney pointed at the statue adorning the roof of
 the court building. 'Audrey Hill told me that there is
 no God and we all know that Justice is blind, so we
 just have to look out for each other, don't we?'</p>

<p>Kate linked her arm in his as they walked away.
 'Seems to me that looking after you is going to be a
 full-time job.'</p>

<p>Delaney dropped his voice to the rich burr of his
 childhood tongue. 'That's because I'm all man,

<p>Kate laughed. 'All ego maybe.'</p>

<p>Delaney's phone trilled in his pocket and he flicked
 it out to answer it. 'Delaney.'</p>

<p>The voice on the other end of the line took him
 straight back to that childhood, almost as if he had
 summoned it. Took him back to a day of sunshine
 and wonders and joy at the world.</p>

<p>'Jack, it's Mary, your cousin Mary. I need your
 help,' she said.</p>

<p>And at that moment a crow took off from the roof
 of the court building behind them, its dusty wings
 flapping like shook canvas in the bright, still air, and
 its caw like the mockery of God.</p>

<empty-line /><empty-line /><p><strong>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</strong></p>

<p>This is a work of fiction and although all of the
 characters are indeed fictional some of the places
 mentioned within are real – so firstly a big apology to
 London! One of the most diverse, exhilarating and
 dynamic cities on the planet, and yet in these pages it
 comes across as rather a bleak place, to say the least;
 but all cities are viewed through different eyes and
 Jack Delaney's are a little more bloodshot and
 jaundiced than most. Some of the places mentioned
 in the book, however, are not real. Delaney works
 out of an entirely fictional police station and The Pig
 and Whistle is a pub that, sadly, does not exist;
 likewise a curious tourist would struggle to find
 South Hampstead Common or South Hampstead
 Tube or the Royal South Hampstead Hospital, but
 they would be well rewarded indeed, however, if they
 decided to check if the Holly Bush pub really did add
 a dash of wine to their Bloody Marys!</p>

<p>A lot of people should be thanked for the hard
 work they have put into bringing <emphasis>Blood Work</emphasis> to
 the bookshelf. And so, many thanks to James
 Nightingale, Tess Callaway and the lovely Caroline
 Gascoigne for their incredible help and support, the
 sales and marketing team from Hutchinson who did
 so much to get Jack Delaney out amongst the public,
 Justine for her eagle eye, Anna Hughes who handled
 the baton like an Olympiad and Robert Caskie for his
 continual encouragement and advice. Lucie Birnie of
 Lucy's Cafe for making me big in the Runtons and
 especially Lynn Butler for keeping my spirits high and
 the decanter full!</p>

<p>But the biggest thanks to you the reader, without
 whom Jack Delaney would just be a sad and bitter
 man, mumbling incoherently to himself in the corner
 of an empty bar as he sips his solitary pint.</p>

<p>ALSO AVAILABLE IN ARROW, A COLLECTION OF COMING-OF-AGE
 STORIES FROM SOME OF THE MASTERS OF CRIME
 FICTION, SELECTED AND EDITED BY JOHN HARVEY</p><empty-line /><p><strong><emphasis>Men From Boys</emphasis></strong></p>

<p>'Terrific tales' <emphasis>Independent on Sunday</emphasis></p>

<p>Featuring Mark Billingham, Lawrence Block, Michael Connelly,
 Jeffery Deaver, John Harvey, Reginald Hill, Bill James, Dennis
 Lehane, George P. Pelecanos, Peter Robinson, James Sallis, John
 Straley, Brian Thompson, Don Winslow, Daniel Woodrell and a
 novella by Andrew Coburn.</p>

<p>Little is perfect for the men in these seventeen crime stories and
 nothing is straightforward. The worlds they inhabit are as different
 as a deprived London housing estate and a rundown jazz joint in
 Manhattan, but each of them is striving to determine what is right,
 what will given them dignity, what will earn them self-respect. Some
 succeed. Others fail.</p>

<p>In this acclaimed collection of stories, John Harvey has gathered
 together some of the very best names in contemporary crime
 writing. Together thse writers answer what it is to be a father, a son,
 a man.</p>

<p>'Bonus points to Harvey as editor for taste, virtuosity and some
 weird kind of compatibility-spotting which detects kinship between
 the most dissimilar authors. An original, outstanding collection –
 readable and rewarding from start to finish' <emphasis>Literary Review</emphasis></p>

<p>Karin Slaughter</p>

<p><strong>Three people with something to hide. One killer with
 nothing to lose.</strong></p>

<p>When Atlanta police detective Michael Ormewood is called out
 to a murder scene at the notorious Grady Homes, he finds
 himself faced with one of the most brutal killings of his career:
 Aleesha Monroe is found in the stairwell in a pool of her own
 blood, her body horribly mutilated.</p>

<p>As a one-off killing it's shocking, but when it becomes clear that
 it's just the latest in a series of similar attacks, the Georgia
 Bureau of Investigation are called in, and Michael is forced into
 working with Special Agent Will Trent of the Criminal
 Apprehension Team – a man he instinctively dislikes.</p>

<p>Twenty-four hours later, the violence Michael sees around him
 every day explodes in his own back yard. And it seems the
 mystery behind Monroe's death is inextricably entangled with a
 past that refuses to stay buried . . .</p>

<p>'This is without doubt an accomplished, compelling and
 complex tale, with page-turning power aplenty' <emphasis>Daily Express</emphasis></p>

<p>Why did he do it? Why had it happened? What sort of fiend
 was he? Why should Victor Jenner, the child of happily-married,
 middle-class parents, succumb to such violent rages? Why
 should he have needed to make motiveless attacks on women?
 Victor didn't know.</p>

<p>But Victor did know that the last ten years – the years in prison
 – had been a mistake. He had never intended to harm anyone.
 It had all been an accident. In fact, his life had been a series of
 accidents, one mistake leading to the next.</p>

<p>Now, out of prison at last, Victor still isn't free. The past holds
 him so he can't go forward. So Victor goes back – and begins a
 chain of accidents, a new string of tragic mistakes.</p>

<p>Richard Montanari</p>

<p>Philadelphia is blistering in the summer heat and detectives
 Kevin Byrne and Jessica Balzano prowl the streets with growing
 unease. Suddenly, a series of crimes shatters the restless city.
 A beautiful secretary is slashed to death in a grimy motel
 shower; a street hustler brutally murdered with a chainsaw.
 Piece by piece, a sickening puzzle presents itself: someone is
 recreating famous Hollywood murder scenes and inserting the
 clips into videos – for an unsuspecting public to find.</p>

<p>Investigations reveal a violent world of underground film,
 pornography and seedy nightclubs, hidden to all but the
 initiated. None of The Actor's victims are as innocent as they
 appear, though, and Kevin and Jessica soon discover they're not
 just chasing a homicide suspect. They are stalking evil itself . . .</p>

 Forty-eight hours. If you don't find them in that, likely
 they're sodding dead . . .</emphasis></p>

<p>A cabbie's been beaten up, there's a drunk and disorderly in the
 interview room and a possible child abuser on the way in.
 Nothing unusual there, then, just a pretty normal Christmas
 holiday for DI Resnick and his team.</p>

<p>Normal, that is, until Dana Mattheison calls to report her
 flatmate, Nancy, missing</p>

<p>Pretty soon the police have proof that Nancy was kidnapped, and
 then – as the New Year celebrations wind down – the first tape
 arrives, and Resnick knows they're dealing with a dangerous
 psychopath.</p>
