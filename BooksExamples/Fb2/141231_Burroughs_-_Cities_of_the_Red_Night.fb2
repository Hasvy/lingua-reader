liberal principles embodied in the French and American revolutions
and later in the liberal revolutions of 1848 had already been
codified and put into practice by pirate communes a hundred years
earlier. Here is a quote from <emphasis>Under the Black Flag </emphasis>by Don C.
Seitz:</p><empty-line /><p>Captain Mission was one
of the forbears of the French Revolution. He was one hundred years in
advance of his time, for his career was based upon an initial desire
to better adjust the affairs of mankind, which ended as is quite
usual in the more liberal adjustment of his own fortunes. It is
related how Captain Mission, having led his ship to victory against
an English man-of-war, called a meeting of the crew. Those who wished
to follow him he would welcome and treat as brothers; those who did
not would be safely put ashore. One and all embraced the New Freedom.
Some were for hoisting the Black Flag at once but Mission demurred,
saying that they were not pirates but liberty lovers, fighting for
equal rights against all nations subject to the tyranny of
government, and bespoke a white flag as the more fitting emblem. The
ship's money was put in a chest to be used as common property.
Clothes were now distributed to all in need and the republic of the
sea was in full operation.</p>

<p>	Mission bespoke them
to live in strict harmony among themselves; that a misplaced society
would adjudge them still as pirates. Self-preservation, therefore,
and a cruel disposition, compelled them to declare war on all nations
who should close their ports to them. "I declare such war and at
the same time recommend to you a humane and generous behavior towards
your prisoners, which will appear by so much more the effects of a
noble soul and as we are satisfied we should not meet the same
treatment should our ill fortune or want of courage give us up to
their mercy...."</p>

<p>The
<emphasis>Nieustadt</emphasis> of Amsterdam was made prize;, giving up two thousand
pounds and gold dust and seventeen slaves. The slaves were added to
the crew and clothed in the Dutchman's spare garments; Mission made
an address denouncing slavery, holding that men who sold others like
beasts proved their religion to be no more than a grimace as no man
had power of liberty over another....</p><empty-line /><p>Mission explored the
Madagascar coast and found a bay ten leagues north of Diégo-Saurez.
It was resolved to establish here the shore quarters of the
Republic—erect a town, build docks, and have a place they might
call their own. The colony was called Libertatia and was placed under
Articles drawn up by Captain Mission. The Articles state, among other
things: all decisions with regard to the colony to be submitted to
vote by the colonists; the abolition of the death penalty; and
freedom to follow any religious beliefs or practices without sanction
or molestation.</p>

<p>	Captain Mission's
colony, which numbered about three hundred, was wiped out by a
surprise attack from the natives, and Captain Mission was killed
shortly afterwards in a sea battle. There were other such colonies in
the West Indies and in Central and South America, but they were not
able to maintain themselves since they were not sufficiently populous
to withstand attack. Had they been able to do so, the history of the
world could have been altered. Imagine a number of such fortified
positions all through South America and the West Indies, stretching
from Africa to Madagascar and the East Indies, all offering refuge to
fugitives from slavery and oppression: "Come to us and live
under the Articles."</p>

<p>	At
once we have allies in all those who are enslaved and oppressed
throughout the world, from the cotton plantations of the American
South to the sugar plantations of the West Indies, and the whole
Indian population of the American continent peonized and degraded by
the Spanish into subhuman poverty and ignorance, exterminated by the
Americans, infected with their vices and diseases, the natives of
Africa and Asia—all these are potential allies. Fortified
positions supported by and supporting guerilla hit-and-run bands;
supplied with soldiers, weapons, medicines and information by the
local populations ... such a combination would be unbeatable. If the
whole American army couldn't beat the Viet Cong at a time when
fortified positions were rendered obsolete by artillery and air
strikes, certainly the armies of Europe, operating in unfamiliar
territory and susceptible to all the disabling diseases of tropical
countries, could not have beaten guerilla tactics <emphasis>plus</emphasis>
fortified positions. Consider the difficulties which such an invading
army would face: continual harassment from the guerillas, a totally
hostile population always ready with poison, misdirection, snakes and
spiders in the general's bed, armadillos carrying the deadly
earth-eating disease rooting under the barracks and adopted as
mascots by the regiment as dysentery and malaria take their toll. The
sieges could not but present a series of military disasters. There is
no stopping the Articulated. The white man is retroactively relieved
of his burden. Whites will be welcomed as workers, settlers,
teachers, and technicians, but not as colonists or masters. No man
may violate the Articles.</p>

<p>	Imagine such a
movement on a world-wide scale. Faced by the actual practice of
freedom, the French and American revolutions would be forced to stand
by their words. The disastrous results of uncontrolled
industrialization would also be curtailed, since factory workers and
slum dwellers from the cities would seek refuge in Articulated areas.
Any man would have the right to settle in any area of his choosing.
The land would belong to those who used it. No white-man boss, no
Pukka Sahib, no Patróns, no colonists. The escalation of mass
production and concentration of population in urban areas would be
halted, for who would work in their factories and buy their products
when he could live from the fields and the sea and the lakes and the
rivers in areas of unbelievable plenty? And living from the land, he
would be motivated to preserve its resources.</p>

<p>	I cite this example of
retroactive Utopia since it actually could have happened in terms of
the techniques and human resources available at the time. Had Captain
Mission lived long enough to set an example for others to follow,
mankind might have stepped free from the deadly impasse of insoluble
problems in which we now find ourselves.</p>

<p>	The chance was there.
The chance was missed. The principles of the French and American
revolutions became windy lies in the mouths of politicians. The
liberal revolutions of 1848 created the so-called republics of
Central and South America, with a dreary history of dictatorship,
oppression, graft, and bureaucracy, thus closing this vast,
underpopulated continent to any possibility of communes along the
lines set forth by Captain Mission. In any case South America will
soon be crisscrossed by highways and motels. In England, Western
Europe, and America, the overpopulation made possible by the
Industrial Revolution leaves scant room for communes, which are
commonly subject to state and federal law and frequently harassed by
the local inhabitants. There is simply no room left for "freedom
from the tyranny of government" since city dwellers depond on it
for food, power, water, transportation, protection, and welfare. Your
right to live where you want, with companions of your choosing, under
laws to which you agree, died in the eighteenth century with Captain
Mission. Only a miracle or a disaster could restore it.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>Invocation</p><empty-line /><p>This

13, 1923.</p>

<p>Farnsworth,
the District Health Officer, was a man so grudging in what he asked
of life that every win was a loss; yet he was not without a certain
plodding persistence of effort and effectiveness in his limited area.
The current emergency posed by the floods and the attendant cholera
epidemic, while it did not spur him to any unusual activity, left him
unruffled.</p>

<p>Every
morning at sunrise, he bundled his greasy maps—which he studied
at breakfast while he licked butter off his fingers—into his
battered Land-Rover and set out to inspect his district, stopping
here and there to order more sandbags for the levees (knowing his
orders would be disregarded, as they generally were unless the
Commissioner happened to be with him). He ordered three bystanders,
presumably relatives, to transport a cholera case to the district
hospital at Waghdas and left three opium pills andinstructions for
preparing rice water. They nodded, and he drove on, having done what
he could.</p>

<p>The
emergency hospital at Waghdas was installed in an empty army barracks
left over from the war. It was understaffed and overcrowded, mostly
by patients who lived near enough and were still strong enough to
walk. The treatment for cholera was simple: each patient was assigned
to a straw pallet on arrival and given a gallon of rice water and
half a gram of opium. If he was still alive twelve hours later, the
dose of opium was repeated. The survival rate was about twenty
percent. Pallets of the dead were washed in carbolic solution and
left in the sun to dry. The attendants were mostly Chinese who had
taken the job because they were allowed to smoke opium and feed the
ash to the patients. The smell of cooking rice, opium smoke,
excrement and carbolic permeated the hospital and the area around it
for several hundred yards.</p>

<p>At
ten o'clock the Health Officer entered the hospital. He requisitioned
more carbolic and opium, and sent off another request for a doctor,
which he expected and hoped would be ignored. He felt that a doctor
fussing around the hospital would only make matters worse; he might
even object to the opium dosage as too high, or attempt to interfere
with the opium smoking of the attendants. The Health Officer had very
little use for doctors. They simply complicated things to make
themselves important.</p>

<p>After
spending half an hour in the hospital, he drove to Ghadis to see the
Commissioner, who invited him to lunch. He accepted without
enthusiasm, declining a gin before lunch and a beer with lunch. He
picked at the rice and fish, and ate a small plate of stewed fruit.
He was trying to persuade the Commissioner to assign some convicts to
work on the levees.</p>

<p>"Sorry,
old boy, not enough soldiers to guard them."</p>

<p>"Well,
it's a serious situation."</p>

<p>"Daresay."</p>

<p>Farnsworth
did not press the point. He simply did what he could and let it go at
that. Newcomers to the district wondered what kept him going at all.
Old-timers like the Commissioner knew. For the Health Officer had a
sustaining vice. Every morning at sunrise, he brewed a pot of strong
tea and washed down a gram of opium. When he returned from his rounds
in the evening, he repeated the dose and gave it time to take effect
before he prepared his evening meal of stewed fruit and wheat bread.
He had no permanent houseboy, since he feared a boy might steal his
opium. Twice a week he had a boy in to clean the bungalow, and then
he locked his opium up in an old rusty safe where he kept his
reports. He had been taking opium for five years and had stabilized
his dosage after the first year and never increased it, nor gone on
to injections of morphine. This was not due to strength of character,
but simply to the fact that he felt he owed himself very little, and
that was what he allotted himself.</p>

<p>Driving
back to find the sandbags not there, the cholera patient dead, and
his three relatives droopy-eyed from the opium pills he had left, he
felt neither anger nor exasperation, only the slight lack that had
increased in the last hour of his drive, so that he stepped harder on
the accelerator. Arriving at his bungalow, he washed down an opium
pill with bottled water and lit the kerosene stove for his tea. He
carried the tea onto the porch and by the time he had finished the
second cup, he was feeling the opium wash through the back of his
neck and down his withered thighs. He could have passed for fifty;
actually he was twenty-eight. He sat there for half an hour looking
at the muddy river and the low hills covered with scrub. There was a
mutter of thunder, and as he cooked his evening meal the first drops
of rain fell on the rusty galvanized iron roof.</p>

<p>He
awoke to the unaccustomed sound of lapping water. Hastily he pulled
on his pants and stepped onto the porch. Rain was still falling, and
the water had risen during the night to a level of twelve inches
under the bungalow and a few inches below the hubcaps of his
Land-Rover. He washed down an opium pill and put water on the stove
for his tea. Then he dusted off an alligator-skin Gladstone bag and
started packing, opening drawers and compartments in the safe. He
packed clothes, reports, a compass, a sheath knife, a 45 Webley
revolver and a box of shells, matches, and a mess kit. He filled his
canteen with bottled water and wrapped a loaf of bread in paper.
Pouring his tea, the water rising under his feet, he experienced a
tension in the groin, a surge of adolescent lust that was stronger
for being inexplicable and inappropriate. His medical supplies and
opium he packed in a separate bag, and as an added precaution, a slab
of opium the size of a cigarette package, wrapped in heavy tinfoil,
went into his side coat pocket. By the time he had finished packing,
his pants were sticking out at the fly. The opium would soon take
care of that.</p>

<p>He
stepped from the porch into the Land-Rover. The motor caught, and he
headed for high ground above the flood. The route he took was seldom
used and several times he had to cut trees out of the road with an
ax. Towards sundown, he reached the medical mission of Father Dupré.
This was out of his district, and he had met the priest only once
before.</p>

<p>Father
Dupré, a thin red -faced mad with a halo of white hair,
greeted him politely but without enthusiasm. He brightened somewhat
when Farnsworth brought out his supplies and went with him to the
dispensary and hospital, which was simply a large hut screened-in at
the sides. The Health Officer passed out opium pills to all the
patients.</p>

<p>"No
matter what is wrong with them, they will feel better shortly."</p>

<p>The
priest nodded absently as he led the way back to the house.
Farnsworth had swallowed his opium pill with water from his canteen,
and it was beginning to take effect as he sat down on the porch. The
priest was looking at him with a hostility he was trying hard to
conceal. Farnsworth wondered what exactly was wrong. The priest
fidgeted and cleared his throat. He said abruptly in a strained
voice, "Would you care for a drink?"</p>

<p>"Thank
you, no. I never touch it."</p>

<p>Relief
flooded the priest's face with a beneficent glow. "Something
else then?"</p>

<p>"I'd
love some tea."</p>

<p>"Of
course. I'll have the boy make it."</p>

<p>The
priest came back with a bottle of whiskey, a glass, and a soda
siphon. Farnsworth surmised that he kept his whiskey under lock and
key somewhere out of the reach of his boys. The priest poured himself
a generous four fingers and shot in a dash of soda. He took a long
drink and beamed at his guest. Farnsworth decided that the moment was
propitious to ask a favor, while the good father was still relieved
at not having to share his dwindling supply of whiskey, and before he
had overindulged.</p>

<p>"I
want to get through to Ghadis if possible. I suppose it's hopeless by
road, even if I had enough petrol?"</p>

<p>The
priest got a map and spread it out on the table. "Absolutely out
of the question. This whole area is flooded. Only possibility is by
boat to here ... from there it's forty miles downriver to Ghadis. I
could lend you a boat with a boy and outboard, but there's no petrol
here...."</p>

<p>"I
think I have enough petrol for that, considering it's all
downstream."</p>

<p>
"You'll run into logjams—may take hours
to cut through ... figure how long it could take you at the longest,
and then double it ... my boy knows the route as far as here. Now
this stretch here is very dangerous ... the river narrows quite
suddenly, no noise you understand, and no warning ... advise you tot
ake the canoe out and carry it down to here ... take one extra day,
but well worth it at this time of year. Of course you <emphasis>might</emphasis>
get through—but if anything goes wrong ... the current, you
understand ... even a strong swimmer ..."</p>

<p>The
following day at dawn, Farnsworth's belongings and the supplies for
the trip were loaded into the dugout canoe. The boy, Ali, was a smoky
black with sharp features, clearly a mixture of Arab and Negro stock.
He was about eighteen, with beautiful teeth and a quick shy smile.
The priest waved from the jetty as the boat swung into midstream.
Farsnworth sat back lazily, watching the water and the jungle slide
past. There was not much sign of life. A few birds and monkeys. Once
three alligators wallowing in a mudbank slid into the water, showing
their teeth in depraved smiles. Several times logjams had to be
cleared with an ax.</p>

<p>At
sundown they made camp on a gravel bank. Farnsworth put water on for
tea while Ali walked to the end of the band and dropped a hook baited
with a worm into a deep clear pool. By the time the water was
boiling, he was back with an eighteen-inch fish. As Ali cleaned the
fish and cut it into sections, Farnsworth washed down his opium pill.
He offered one to Ali, who examined it, sniffed at it, smiled, and
shook his head.</p>

<p>"Chinese
boy ..." He leaned over holding an imaginery opium pipe to a
lamp. He drew the smoke in and let his eyes droop. "No get—"
He put his hands on his stomach and rocked back and forth.</p>

<p>By
the afternoon of the second day the stream had widened considerably.
Towards sundown Farnsworth took an opium pill and dozed off. Suddenly
he was wide awake with a start, and he reached for the map. This was
the stretch that Father Dupré had warned him about. He turned
towards Ali, but Ali knew already. He was steering for shore.</p>

<p>The
silent rush of the current swept the boat broadside, and the rudder
wire snapped like a bowstring. The boat twisted out of control, swept
towards a logjam. A splintering crash, and Farnsworth was underwater,
struggling desperately against the current. He felt a stab of pain as
a branch ripped through his coat and along his side.</p>

<p>He
came to on the bank. Ali was pushing water out of his lungs. He sat
up breathing heavily and coughing. His coat was in tatters, ozzing
blood. He felt for his pocket, and looked at his empty hand. The
opium was gone. He had sustained a superficial scratch down the left
hip and across the buttock. They had salvaged nothing except the
short machete that Ali wore in a sheath at his belt, and Farnsworth's
hunting knife.</p>

<p>Farnsworth
drew a map in the sand to approximate their positing. He calculated
the distance to one of the large tributaries to be about forty miles.
Once there, they could fashion a raft and drift downstream to Ghadis,
where of course ... the words of Father Dupré played back in
his mind: "Figure the longest time it could take you and then
double it...."</p>

<p>Darkness
was falling, and they had to stay there for the night, even though he
was losing precious travel time. He knew that in seventy-two hours at
the outside he would be immobilized for lack of opium. At daybreak
they set out heading north. Progress was slow; the undergrowth had to
be cut step by step. There were swamps and streams in the way, and
from time to time deep gorges that necessitated long detours. The
unaccustomed exertion knocked the opium out of his system, and by
nightfall he was already feverish and shivering.</p>

<p>By
morning he was barely able to walk, but managed to stagger along for
a few miles. The next day he was convulsed by stomach cramps and they
barely covered a mile. The third day he could not move. Ali massaged
his legs, which were knotted with cramps, and brought him water and
fruit. He lay there unable to move for four days and four nights.</p>

<p>Occasionally
he dozed off and woke up screaming from nightmares. These often took
the form of attacks by centipedes and scorpions of strange sizes and
shapes, moving with great speed, that would suddenly rush at him.
Another recurrent nightmare was set in the market of a Near Eastern
city. The place was at first unknown to him but more familiar with
each step he took, as if some hideous jigsaw of memory were slowly
falling into place: the stalls all empty of food and merchandise, the
smell of hunger and death, the greenish glow and a strange smoky sun,
sulfurous blazing hate in faces that turned to look at him as he
passed. Now they were all pointing at him and shouting a word he
could not understand.</p>

<p>On
the eighth day he was able to walk again. He was still racked with
stomach cramps and diarrhea, but the leg cramps were almost gone. On
the tenth day he felt distinctly better and stronger, and was able to
eat a fish. On the fourteenth day they reached a sandbank by a wide
clear river. This was not the tributary they were looking for, but
would certainly lead into it. Ali had saved a piece of carbolic soap
in a tin box, and they stripped off their tattered clothes and waded
into the cool water. Farnsworth washed off the dirt and sweat and
smell of his sickness. Ali was rubbing soap on his back and
Farnsworth felt a sudden rush of blood to the crotch. Trying to hide
his erection, he waded ashore with his back to Ali, who followed
laughing and splashing water to wash the soap off.</p>

<p>Farnsworth
lay down on his shirt and pants and fell into a wordless vacuum,
feeling the sun on his back and the faint ache of the healing
scratch. He saw Ali sitting naked above him, Ali's hands massaging
his back, moving down to the buttocks. Something was surfacing in his
body, drifting up from remote depths of memory, and he saw as if
projected on a screen a strange incident from his adolescence. He was
in the British Museum at the age of fourteen, standing in front of a
glass case. He was alone in the room. In the case was the figure,
about two feet long, of a reclining man. The man was naked, the right
knee flexed, holding the body a few inches off the grond, the penis
exposed. The hands were extended in front of the man palms down, and
the face was reptile or animal, something between an alligator and a
jaguar.</p>

<p>The
boy was looking at the thighs and buttocks and genitals, breathing
through his teeth. He was getting stiff and lubricating, his pants
sticking out at the fly. He was squeezing into the figure, a dream
tension gathering in his crotch, squeezing and stretching, a strange
smell unlike anything he had ever smelled before but familiar as
smell itself, a naked man lying by a wide clear river—the
twisted figure. Silver spots boiled in front of his eyes and he
ejaculated.</p>

<p>Ali's
hands parted his buttocks, he spit on his rectum—his body
opening and the figure entering him in a silent rush, flexing his
right knee, stretching his jaw forward into a snout, his head
flattening, his brain squeezing out the smell from inside ... a
hoarse hissing sound was forced from his lips and light popped in his
eyes as his body boiled and twisted out scalding spurts.</p><empty-line /><p><emphasis>Stage with a jungle

stopped a few hundred yards from the village on the bank of a stream.
Yen Lee studied the village through his field glasses while his men
sat down and lit cigarettes. The village was built into the side of a
mountain. The stream ran through the town, and water had been
diverted into pools on a series of cultivated terraces that led up to
the monastery. There was no sign of life in the steep winding street
or by the pools. The valley was littered with large boulders which
would serve as cover if necessary, but he did not expect resistance
on a military level. He lowered his glasses, signaling for the men to
follow.</p>

<p>	They crossed a stone
bridge two at a time, covered by the men behind them. If any
defenders were going to open fire, now would be the time and place to
do it. Beyond the bridge the street twisted up the mountainside. On
both sides there were stone huts, many of them fallen into ruin and
obviously deserted. As they moved up the stone street, keeping to the
sides and taking cover behind the ruined huts, Yen Lee became
increasingly aware of a hideous unknown odor. He motioned the patrol
to halt and stood there sniffing.</p>

<p>	Unlike his
counterparts in western countries, he had been carefully selected for
a high level of intuitive adjustment, and trained accordingly to
imagine and explore seemingly fantastic potentials in any situation,
while at the same time giving equal consideration to prosaic and
practical aspects. He had developed an attitude at once probing and
impersonal, remote and alert. He did not know when the training had
begun, since in Academy 23 it was carried out in a context of
reality. He did not see his teachers, whose instructions were
conveyed through a series of real situations.</p>

<p>	He had been born in
Hong Kong and had lived there until the age of twelve, so that
English was a second language. Then his family had moved to Shanghai.
In his early teens he had read the American Beat writers. The volumes
had been brought through Hong Kong and sold under the counter in a
bookshop that seemed to enjoy freedom from official interference,
although the proprietor was also engaged in currency deals.</p>

<p>	At the age of sixteen
he was sent to a military academy, where he received intensive
training in the use of weapons. After six months he was summoned to
the Colonel's office and told that he would be leaving the military
school and returning to Shanghai. Since he had applied himself to the
training and made an excellent showing, he asked the Colonel if this
was because his work had not been satisfactory. The Colonel was
looking not at him but around him, as if drawing a figure in the air.
He indicated obliquely that while a desire to please one's superiors
was laudable, other considerations were in certain cases even more
highly emphasized.</p>

<p>	The smell hit him like
an invisible wall. He stopped and leaned against a house. It was like
rotten metal or metal excrement, he decided. The patrol was still in
the ruined outskirts of the village. One man was vomiting violently,
his face beaded with sweat. He straightened up and started towards
the stream. Yen Lee stopped him: "Don't drink the water or
splash it on your face. The stream runs through the town."</p>

<p>	Yen Lee sat down and
looked once again at the town through his field glasses. There were
still no villagers in sight. He put his glasses down and conducted an
out-of-body exploration of the village—what westerners call
"astral travel." He was moving up the street now, his gun
at the ready. The gun would shoot blasts of energy, and he could feel
it tingle in his hands. He kicked open a door.</p>

<p>	One glance told him
that interrogation was useless. He would get no information on a
verbal level. A man and a woman were in the terminal stages of some
disease, their faces eaten to the bone by phosphorescent sores. An
older woman was dead. The next hut contained five corpses, all
elderly.</p>

<p>	In another hut a youth
lay on a pallet, the lower half of his body covered by a blanket.
Bright red nipples of flesh about an inch in height, growing in
clusters, covered his chest and stomach and sprouted from his face
and neck. The growths looked like exotic plants. He noticed that they
were oozing a pearly juice that ate into the flesh, leaving
luminescent sores. Sensing Yen Lee's presence the youth turned
towards him with a slow idiot smile, arching his body and caressing
the flesh clusters with one hand while the other hand slid under the
blanket and moved to his crotch. In another hut, Yen Lee glimpsed a
scene that he quickly erased from memory.</p>

<p>	Yen Lee advanced
towards the monastery. Then he stopped. The gun went heavy and solid
in his hands as energy left it. His training had not quite prepared
him for the feeling of death that fell in a steady silent rain from
the monastery above him. The monastery must contain a deadly force,
probably some form of radioactivity, perhaps psychic fission. He
surmised further that the illness afflicting the villagers was a
radioactive virus strain. He knew that top-secret research in the
West was moving in this direction: as early as World War II, England
had developed a radioactive virus known as the Doomsday Bug.</p>

<p>	Returning to his body
Yen Lee weighed his observations and surmises. What had he glimpsed
and hastily looked away from? Tiny creatures like translucent shrimp
feeding at the flesh nipples ... and something else.... He did not
push himself, knowing that a biologic protective reaction was
shielding him from knowledge he was unable to assimilate and handle.
The monastery probably contained a laboratory and the village had
been used as a testing ground. How did the technicians protect
themselves from the radiation? Could the laboratory be operated by
remote control? Or had the technicians been immunized by gradient
exposure? Did the laboratory contain a sophisticated DOR
installation?</p>

<p>	He picked up a
walkie-talkie. "Pre-Talk calling Dead Line...."</p>

<p>	"Well?" The
Colonel's voice was cool, edged with abstract impatience. Cadets were
expected to use their own initiative on patrol and only call in the
case of emergency. Yen Lee recounted what he had seen in the village
and described the feeling of death that emanated from the monastery.
"It's like a wall. I can't get through it. Certainly my men
can't...."</p>

<p>	"Withdraw from
the village and make camp. A sanitary squad and a health officer are
on the way."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>The doctor is on the
market</p><empty-line /><p>Doctor Pierson was a
discreet addict who kept himself down to three shots a day, half a
grain in each shot—he could always cover for that. Towards the
end of an eight-hour shift he tended to be perfunctory, so when he
got the call from emergency he hoped it wouldn't take long or keep
him overtime. Of course he could always slip a half-grain under his
tongue, but that was wasteful and he liked to be in bed when he took
his shot, and feel it hit the back of his neck and move down the
backs of his thighs while he blew cigarette smoke towards the
ceiling. As he reached for his bag he noticed that he had barked his
knuckles. He couldn't remember where or when—that happens, when
you are feeling no pain.</p>

<p>	"It looks like
measles, Doctor."</p>

<p>	The
doctor looked a the boy's face with distaste. He disliked children,
adolescents, and animals. The word <emphasis>cute</emphasis> did not exist in his
emotional vocabulary. There were red blotches on the boy's face but
they seemed rather large for measles....</p>

<p>	"Well, get it in
here, Nurse, whatever it is ... away from the other patients. Not
that I care what they catch; it's just hospital procedure."</p>

<p>	The boy was wheeled
into a cubicle. His finger cold with reluctance, the doctor folded
the sheet down to the boy's waist and noticed that he was wearing no
shorts.</p>

<p>	"Why is he
naked?" he snapped at the attendants.</p>

<p>	"He was like that
when they picked him up, Doctor."</p>

<p>	"Well, they might
have put something on him...." He turned back to the attendants.
"What are you standing there for? Get out! And you, Nurse, what
are you gawking at? Order a bed in isolation."</p>

<p>	His temper was always
evil when he ran over like this, but right after a shot he could be
nice in a dead, fishy way. The doctor turned back to the boy on the
bed. His duty as a physician was clear—Hippocrates pointing
sternly to the sheet. "Well, I suppose I have to look at the
little naked beast." He folded the sheet down to the boy's
knees. The boy had an erection. The genitals and areas adjacent were
bright red like a red bikini.</p>

<p>	The doctor leaped back
as he would from a striking snake, but he was too late. A gob of
semen hit the back of his hand right on the skinned knuckles. He
wiped it off with an exclamation of disgust. He recalled later that
he felt a slight tingling sensation which he didn't notice at the
time, being that disgusted with the human body—he wondered why
he had chosen the medical profession. And this dirty child was
delaying his fix. "You filthy little beast!" he snapped.
The boy sniggered. The doctor pulled the sheet up to the boy's chin.</p>

<p>	He
was washing his hands when the nurse came in with a stretcher table
and an orderly to take the boy to isolation. The doctor sniffed. "My
God, what's that smell? ... I don't know what this is, Nurse, but
it's rather disgusting. He seems to be in some state of sexual
delirium. He also seems to be giving off a horrible odor. Order the
broad spectrum ... cortisone, of course—it may be an allergic
condition red-haired animals are especially liable to—and the
usual antibiotics....If the sexual condition continues, do not
hesitate to administer morphine." The doctor gasped and clasped
a handkerchief in front of his mouth and nose. <emphasis>"Get it out of
here!"</emphasis> (He always referred to a patient as "the
disease.") "Do you have a typhoid bed in isolation?"
he asked.</p>

<p>	"Not now we
don't."</p>

<p>	"Well
<emphasis>it</emphasis> can't stay here."</p><empty-line /><p>He had barely settled
in bed after his fix when the phone rang. It was the super. "Seems
we have an epidemic on our hands, Pierson. All staff report back to
the hospital immediately."</p>

<p>	Could it be that dirty
little boy? he thought as he dressed and picked up his satchel and
walked to the hospital. He saw there was a police line around the
entrance.</p>

<p>	"Oh, yes, Doctor,
Right over there for your mask."</p>

<p>	"I'll
help you put it on, Doctor." A brisk young girl in some sort of
uniform rubber her tits against him in a most offensive manner. And
before she got the mask on, he smelled it and he knew: it <emphasis>was</emphasis>
that dirty little boy.</p>

<p>	Inside was a scene
from Dante: stretchers side by side in the corridors, sperm all over
the sheets, the walls and the floor.</p>

<p>	"Be careful,
Doctor." A garrulous old nurse caught his arm in time. "Just
put one foot solidly in front of the other, Doctor, that's
right....It's terrible, Doctor, the older patients are dying like
flies."</p>

<p>	"I don't want to
hear any generalities, Nurse ... take me to my ward."</p>

<p>	"Well, Doctor,
you can take the northeast wing if you want—right here."</p>

<p>	Every sort of
copulation was going on in front of him, every disgusting thing they
could think of. Some of them had pillow-cases and towels wrapped
around each other's necks in some kind of awful contest. As these
crazed patients seemed in danger of strangulation (and here the
doctor almost slipped in shit), he ordered attendants to restrain
them, but no attendants were available. "We'll start with
morphine and a curare derivative, Nurse."</p>

<p>	"Sorry, Doctor,
the morphine stocks are exhausted on the older patients. They go into
the most awful spasms at the end, Doctor."</p>

<p>	The doctor turned pale
as death at this terrible pronouncement. He slumped to the floor in a
faint, his face covered with red blotches. By the time they got his
clothes off, his body was also affected, and spontaneous orgasms were
observed.</p><empty-line /><p>Doctor Pierson

for the pickle factory on a sensitive biological project.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>Politics here is death</p><empty-line /><p>Muted remote boardroom.
Doctor Pierson sits at the head of the table with notes in front of
him. He speaks in a dry flat academic voice.</p>

<p>	"Ladies and
gentlemen of the Board, I am here to give a report on preliminary
experiments with Virus B-23.... Consider the origins of this virus in
the Cities of the Red Night. The red glow that covered the northern
sky at night was a form of radiation that gave rise to a plague known
to be the etiological agent.</p>

<p>	"Virus B-23 has
been called, among other things, the virus of biological mutation,
since this agent occasioned biologic alterations in those
affected—fatal in many cases, permanent and hereditary in the
survivors, who became carriers of the strain. The original
inhabitants of these cities were black, but soon a wide spectrum of
albino variations appeared, and this condition was passed on to their
descendants by techniques of artificial insemination which were, to
the say the least, highly developed. In fact, how some of these
mutant pregnancies were contracted is unknown to modern science.
Immaculate or at least viral conception was pandemic and may have
given rise to legends of demon lovers, the succubi and incubi of
medieval folklore."</p>

<p>	Doctor Pierson
continues: "The virus, acting directly on neural centers,
brought about sexual frenzies that facilitated its communication,
just as rabid dogs are driven to spread the virus of rabies by
biting. Various forms of sexual sacrifice were practiced ... sexual
hangings and strangulations, and drugs that caused death in erotic
convulsions. Death during intercourse was a frequent occurrence and
was considered an especially favorable circumstance for conveying the
viral alterations.</p>

<p>	"We are speaking
of more or less virgin genetic material of high quality. At this time
the newly conceived white race was fighting for its biological
continuity, so the virus served a most useful purpose. However, I
question the wisdom of introducing Virus-23 into contemporary America
and Europe. Even though it might quiet the uh silent majority, who
are admittedly becoming uh awkward, we must consider the biologic
consequences of exposing genetic material already damaged beyond
repair to such an agent, leaving a wake of unimaginably unfavorable
mutations all ravenously perpetrating their kind....</p>

<p>	"There have been
other proposals. I cite the work of Doctor Unruh von Steinplatz on
radioactive virus strains. Working with such established viruses as
rabies, hepatitis, and smallpox, he exposed generations of virus to
atomic radiation to produce airborne strains of unbelievable
virulence capable of wiping out whole populations within days.
However, this blueprint contains a flaw: the disposal problem posed
by billions of radioactive corpses unfit even for fertilizer.</p>

<p>	"Ladies and
gentlemen, I propose to remove the temporal limits, shifting our
experimental theater into past time in order to circumvent the whole
tedious problem of overpopulation. You may well ask if we can be
certain of uh containing the virus in past time. The answer is: we do
not have sufficient data to speak with certainty. We propose; the
virus may dispose...."</p>

<p>	A thin man in his
early thirties with sandy hair and pale blue eyes had been taking
notes while Doctor Pierson was speaking. He looked up and spoke in a
clear, rather high-pitched voice with a faint trace of Germanic
accent. "Doctor Pierson, I have a few questions."</p>

<p>	"Certainly,"
said Pierson with cold displeasure. He knew exactly who this man was,
and wished that he had not been invited to attend the meeting. This
was Jon Alistair Peterson, born in Denmark, now working on a secret
government project in England. He was a virologist and mathematician
who had devised a computer to process qualitative data.</p>

<p>	Peterson leaned back
in his chair, one ankle crossed over his knee. He extracted a joint
from his shirt pocket. It was a loud Carnaby Street shirt. Pierson
thought it vulgar. Peterson lit the joint and blew smoke towards the
ceiling, seemingly oblivious of disapproving looks from the board
members. He glanced down at his notes. "My first question is a
matter of uh nomenclature." Pierson was annoyed to realize that
Peterson was mimicking his own academic tones.</p>

<p>	"Professor
Steinplatz's experiments, as you must know, consisted of inoculating
animals with various viruses and then exposing the animals to
radiation. This exposure produced virus mutations tending towards
increased virulence and ..." He took a long drag and blew smoke
across his notes. "... uh increased communication potential. In
plain English, the mutated viruses were much more infectious."</p>

<p>	"I would say that
is a more or less accurate paraphrase of what I have just said."</p>

<p>	"Not
precisely. The mutated virus strains were produced by radiation and
the test animals, having been exposed to radiation, were of course
radioactive to a point but not dangerously so....The viruses were
<emphasis>produced</emphasis> by radiation, but it does not necessarily follow that
the viruses were themselves radioactive. Is not your use of the term
<emphasis>radioactive</emphasis> virus and your uh evocation of billions of
radioactive corpses uh misleading?"</p>

<p>	Doctor Pierson found
it difficult to conceal his annoyance. "I have pointed out that,
owing to the grave dangers inherent in large-scale experimentation
which could among other things severely damage our public image, our
data is incomplete...."</p>

<p>	"Ah yes, to be
sure. And now if you will bear with me, Doctor, I have some
additional questions.... You have said that Virus B-23 resulted from
radiation?" asked Peterson.</p>

<p>	"I did."</p>

<p>	"In what way does
it differ from the strains developed by Doctor Steinplatz?"</p>

<p>	"I thought I made
that point quite clear: the form of radiation emanating from the red
light is unknown at the present time."</p>

<p>	"You are then
ignorant of the nature of this wondrous radiation, or as to how it
could be produced in the laboratory?"</p>

<p>	"Yes."</p>

<p>	"Has it occurred
to you that it might be similar to Reich's DOR, or Deadly Orgone
Radiation, which is produced by placing radioactive material in an
organic container lined with iron?"</p>

<p>	"Preposterous!
Reich was a charlatan! A lunatic!"</p>

<p>	"Perhaps
... but such a simple and <emphasis>inexpensive</emphasis> experiment ... we could
start with herpes simplex."</p>

<p>	"I fail to see
that any useful purpose ..." Pierson glanced around the table.
Stony faces looked back at him. He was concealing something and they
knew it.</p>

<p>	Doctor Pierson looked
at his watch. "I'm afraid I must cut this short. I have a plane
to catch."</p>

<p>	Peterson
held up his hand. "I'm not quite finished, Doctor....I am sure
that a slight delay in takeoff could be arranged for a person of your
importance.... Now, the virus strains developed by Doctor Steinplatz
were, to be sure, more contagious and more virulent than the mother
strains from which they were derived, but still quite recognizable.
For example, for <emphasis>example</emphasis>, the good doctor's airborne rabies
would still be clinically recognizable as rabies. Even if the viruses
were mixed into a cocktail, the individual ingredients would still be
comparatively easy to identify. You would agree, Doctor Pierson?"</p>

<p>	"In theory, yes.
However, we do not know, in the absence of large-scale exposure,
whether the virus might not undergo further mutations that rend
identification difficult."</p>

<p>	"To
be sure. The point I am making is simply that Doctor Steinplatz
started his experiments with certain known viruses.... Doctor
Pierson, you have stated that Virus B-23 <emphasis>resulted</emphasis> from unknown
radiation. Do you imply that this virus was so produced out of thin
air? Let me put it this way: What virus or viruses known to unknown
mutated as a result of this radiation?</p>

<p>	"At the risk of
repeating myself, I will say again that both the radiation and the
virus or viruses are unknown at this time," said Pierson archly.</p>

<p>	"The symptoms of
a virus are the attempts of the body to deal with a virus attack By
their symptoms you shall know them, and even a totally unknown virus
would yield considerable data by its symptoms. On the other hand, if
a virus produces no symptoms, then we have no way of knowing that it
exists ... no way of knowing that it is a virus."</p>

<p>	"So?"</p>

<p>	"So the virus in
question may have been latent or it may have been living in benign
symbiosis with the host."</p>

<p>	"That is, of
course, possible," admitted Pierson.</p>

<p>	"Now let us
consider the symptoms of Virus B-23: fever, rash, a characteristic
odor, sexual frenzies, obsession with sex and death.... Is this so
totally strange and alien?"</p>

<p>	"I don't follow
you."</p>

<p>	"I will make
myself clearer. We know that a consuming passion can produce physical
symptoms...fever...loss of appetite...even allergic reactions...and
few conditions are more obsessional and potentially self-destructive
than love. Are not the symptoms of Virus B-23 simply the symptoms of
what we are pleased to call 'love'? Eve, we are told, was made from
Adam's rib ... so a hepatitis virus was once a healthy liver cell. If
you will excuse me, ladies, nothing personal... we are all tainted
with viral origins. The whole quality of human consciousness, as
expressed in male and female, is basically a virus mechanism. I
suggest that this virus, known as 'the other half,' turned malignant
as a result of the radiation to which the Cities of the Red Night
were exposed."</p>

<p>	"You lost me
there."</p>

<p>	Did I indeed.... And I
would suggest further that any attempts to contain Virus B-23 will
turn out to be ineffectual because we carry this virus with us,"
said Peterson.</p>

<p>	"Really, Doctor,
aren't you letting fantasy run away with you? After all, other
viruses have been brought under control. Why should this virus be an
exception?"</p>

<p>	"Because
it is the <emphasis>human</emphasis> virus. After many thousands of years of more
or less benign coexistence, it is now once again on the verge of
malignant mutation ... what Doctor Steinplatz calls a virgin soil
epidemic. This could result from the radiation already released in
atomic testing...."</p>

<p>	"What's your
point, Doctor?" Pierson snapped.</p>

<p>	"My point is very
simple. The whole human position is no longer tenable. And one last
consideration ...as you know, a vast crater in what is now Siberia is
thought to have resulted from a meteor. It is further theorized that
this meteor brought with it the radiation in question. Others have
surmised that it may not have been a meteor but a black hole, a hole
in the fabric of reality, through which the inhabitants of these
ancient cities traveled in time to a final impasse."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>The rescue</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>A sepia etching
onscreen. Written at the bottom in gold lettering: "The Hanging
of Captain Strobe the Gentleman Pirate. Panama City, May 13, 1702."
In the center of the square in front of a courthouse Captain Strobe
stands on a gallows platform with a noose around his neck. He is a
slender handsome youth of twenty-five in eighteenth-century costume,
his blond hair tied in a knot at the back of his head. He looks
disdainfully down at the crowd. A line of soldiers stands in front of
the gallows.</p>

<p>	The etching slowly
comes alive, giving off a damp heat, a smell of weeds and mud flats
and sewage. Vultures roost on the old courthouse of flaking yellow
stucco. The gypsy hangman—thin, effeminate-looking, with greasy
crinkled hair and glistening eyes—stands by the gallows with a
twisted smirk on his face. The crowd is silent, mouths open, waiting.</p>

<p>	At a signal from an
officer, a soldier steps forward with an ax and knocks the support
from under the platform. Strobe falls and hangs there, his feet a few
inches above the limestone paving which is cracked here and there,
weeds and vines growing through. Five minutes pass in silence.
Vultures wheel overhead. On Strobe's face is a strange smile. A
yellow-green aura surrounds his body.</p>

<p>	The silence is
shattered by an explosion. Chunks of masonry rain down on the square.
The blast swings Strobe's body in a long arc, his feet brushing the
weeds. The soldiers rush offstage, leaving only six men to guard the
gallows. The crowd surges forward, pulling out knives, cutlasses, and
pistols. The soldiers are disarmed. A lithe boy who looks like a
Malay shows white teeth and bright red gums as he throws a knife. The
knife catches the hangman in the throat just above the collarbone. He
falls squawking and spitting blood like a stricken bird. Captain
Strobe is cut down and borne to a waiting carriage.</p>

<p>	The carriage careens
into a side street. Inside the cart the boy loosens the noose and
presses air in and out of Strobe's lungs. Strobe opens his eyes and
writhes in agony from the pricklings and shootings as his circulation
returns. The boy gives him a vial of black liquid.</p>

<p>	"Drink this
Captain."</p>

<p>	In a few minutes the
laudanum takes effect and Strobe is able to walk as they leave the
cart. The boy leads the way along a jungle path to a fishing boat
moored at a pier on the outskirts of the city. Two younger boys are
in the boat. The boat is cast off and the sail set. Captain Strobe
collapses on a pallet in the cabin. The boy helps him undress  and
covers him with a cotton blanket.</p><empty-line /><p>Strobe lay back with
closed eyes. He had not slept since his capture three days ago. The
opium and movement of the boat spread a pleasant languor through his
body. Pictures drifted in front of his eyes.</p>

<p>	A vast ruined stone
building with square marble columns in a green underwater light ... a
luminous green haze, thicker and darker at ground level, shading up
to light greens and yellows ... deep blue canals and red brick
buildings ... sunlight on water ... a boy standing on a beach naked
with dusky rose genitals ... red night sky over a desert city ...
clusters of violet light raining down on sandstone steps and bursting
with a musky smell of ozone ... strange words in his throat, a taste
of blood and metal ... a white ship sailing across a gleaming empty
sky dusted with stars ... singing fish in a ruined garden ... a
strange pistol in his hand that shoots blue sparks ... beautiful
diseased faces in red light, all looking at something he cannot
see....</p>

<p>	He awoke with a
throbbing erection and a sore throat, his brain curiously blank and
factual. He accepted his rescue as he had been prepared to accept his
death. He knew exactly where he was: some forty miles south of Panama
City. He could see the low outline of mangrove swamps laced with
inlets, the shark fins, the stagnant seawater.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>Harbor Point</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>Early morning

picks out their faces.</p>

can go with the Blake mark on it...."</p>

<p>	"Old Lady Norton
stuck her head in the shop and said I shouldn't be working on the
Lord's Day."</p>

<p>	"And she
shouldn't be sniffing her long snot-dripping nose into my shop on the
Lord's Day or any other. The Nortons have never bought so much as a
ha'penny measure of nails off me." His father looks around the
shop, his fingers hooked in his wide belt. Lean and red-haired, he
has the face of a mechanic: detached, factual, a face that minds its
own business and expects others to do the same. "We'll be moving

<p>	"No, son, Boston.

<p>	Father and son put on
coats and gloves. They lock the shop and step out into the muted
streets of the little snowbound village on Lake Michigan. As they
walk through the snow, villagers pass. Some of the greetings are
quick and cold with averted faces.</p>

call from the woods. Noah Blake and his father, Bert Hansen, Clinch

says in her penetrating voice, "Good riddance to the lot of

<p>	"I share the same
views," he says hastily.</p><empty-line /><p>Boston: two years
later. Mr. Blake has prospered. He works now on contracts from
shipowners, and his guns are standard issue. He has remarried. His

importers and merchants with political connections. Mr. Blake plans
to open a New York branch, and there is talk of army and navy
contracts. Noah Blake is studying navigation. He wants to be a ship's
captain, and all five of the boys want to ship out.</p>

<p>	"Wait till you
find the right ship," Mr. Blake tells them.</p><empty-line /><p>One
winter day, Noah is walking on the waterfront with Bert, Clinch, Sean
and Paco. They notice a ship called <emphasis>The Great White</emphasis>. Rather
small by very clean and trim. A man leans over the rail. He has a
beefy red smiling face and cold blue eyes.</p>

<p>	"You boys looking
for a ship?"</p>

<p>	"Maybe,"
says Noah cautiously.</p>

<p>	"Well, come
aboard."</p>

<p>	He
meets them at the gangplank. "I'm Mr. Thomas, First Mate."
He extends a hand like callused beef and shakes hands with each boy
in turn. He leads the way to the master's cabin. "This is
Captain Jones—master of <emphasis>The Great White</emphasis>. These boys are
looking for a ship ... maybe ..."</p>

<p>	The boys nod politely.
Captain Jones looks at them in silence. He is a man of indeterminate
age with a gray-green pallor. He speaks at length, in a flat voice,
his lips barely moving.</p>

<p>	"Well, I could
use five deckhands.... You boys had any experience?"</p>

<p>	"Yes. On the
Great Lakes." Noah indicates Bert Hansen. "His father owned
fishing boats."</p>

<p>	"Aye," says
Captain Jones, "freshwater sailing. The sea's another kettle of
fish."</p>

<p>	"I've studied
navigation," Noah puts in.</p>

<p>	"Have you now?
And what would be your name, lad?"</p>

<p>	"Noah Blake."</p>

<p>	An almost
imperceptible glance passes between the Captain and the first mate.</p>

<p>	"And your trade,

<p>	"Gunsmith."</p>

<p>	"Well, now, you
wouldn't be Noah Blake's son would you?"</p>

<p>	"Yes, sir, I
would."</p>

<p>	Once again the glance
flickers between the two men. Then Captain Jones leans back in his
chair and looks at the boys  with his dead, fishy eyes.</p>

<p>	"We'll be sailing
in three days' time ... New York, Charleston, Jamaica, Vera Cruz. Two
months down, more or less, and two months back.... I pay ten pounds a
month for deckhands."</p>

<p>	Noah Blake tries to
look unimpressed. This is twice as much as any other captain has
offered.</p>

<p>	"Well, sir, I'll
have to discuss it with my father."</p>

<p>	"To be sure, lad.
You can sign the Articles tomorrow if you're so minded ... all five
of you."</p><empty-line /><p>Noah can hardly wait to
tell his father. "I mean that's good, isn't it?"</p>

<p>	"Aye, son.
Perhaps a little too good. Captain Jones's name is not so white as
his ship. He's known as Opium Jones in the trade. He'll be carrying
opium, guns, powder, shot, and tools. And he's not too particular who
he trades with...."</p>

<p>	"Anything wrong
with that, Father?"</p>

<p>	"No. He's no
better and no worse than most of the others. Only thing I can't
figure out is why he's paying double wages for deckhands."</p>

<p>	"Maybe he'd
rather have five good hands than ten waterfront drunks."</p>

<p>	"Maybe.... Well,
go if you like. But keep your eyes open."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>The private asshole</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>The name is Clem
Williamson Snide. I am a private asshole.</p>

<p>	As a private
investigator I run into more death than the law allows. I mean the
law of averages. There I am outside the hotel room waiting for the
corespondent to reach a crescendo of amorous noises. I always find
that if you walk in just as he goes off he won't have time to
disengage himself and take a swing at you. When me and the house dick
open the door with a passkey, the smell of shit and bitter almonds
blows us back into the hall. Seems they both took a cyanide capsule
and fucked until the capsules dissolved. A real messy love death.</p>

<p>	Another time I am
working on a routine case of industrial sabotage when the factory
burns down killing twenty-three people. These things happen. I am a
man of the world. Going to and fro and walking up and down in it.</p>

<p>	Death smells. I mean
it has a special smell, over and above the smell of cyanide, carrion,
blood, cordite or burnt flesh. It's like opium. Once you smell it you
never forget. I can walk down a street and get a whiff of opium smoke
and I know someone is kicking the gong around.</p>

<p>	I got a whiff of death
as soon as Mr. Green walked into my office. You can't always tell
whose death it is. Could be Green, his wife, or the missing son he
wants me to find. Last letter from the island of Spetsai two months
ago. After a month with no word the family made inquiries by
long-distance phone.</p>

<p>	"The embassy
wasn't at all helpful," said Mr. Green.</p>

<p>	I nodded. I knew just
how unhelpful they could be.</p>

<p>	"They referred us
to the Greek police. Fortunately, we found a man there who speaks
English."</p>

<p>"That
would be Colonel Dimitri."</p>

<p>"Yes.
You know him?"</p>

<p>I
nodded, waiting for him to continue.</p>

<p>	"He checked and
could find no record that Jerry had left the country, and no hotel
records after Spetsai."</p>

<p>	"He could be
visiting someone."</p>

<p>	"I'm sure he
would write."</p>

<p>	"You feel then
that this is not just an instance of neglect on his part, or perhaps
a lost letter? ... That happens in the Greek islands...."</p>

<p>	"Both Mrs. Green
and I are convinced that something is wrong."</p>

<p>	"Very well, Mr.
Green, there is the question of my fee: a hundred dollars a day plus
expenses and a thousand-dollar retainer. If I work on a case two days
and spend two hundred dollars, I refund six hundred to the client. If
I have to leave the country, the retainer is two thousand. Are these
terms satisfactory?"</p>

<p>	"Yes."</p>

<p>	"Very good. I'll
start right here in New York. Sometimes I have been able to provide
the client with the missing person's address after a few hours' work.
He may have written to a friend."</p>

<p>	"That's easy. He
left his address book. Asked me to mail it to him care of American
Express in Athens." He passed me the book.</p>

<p>	"Excellent."</p>

<p>	Now, on a
missing-person case I want to know everything the client can tell me
about the missing person, no matter how seemingly unimportant and
irrelevant. I want to know preferences in food, clothing, colors,
reading, entertainment, use of drugs and alcohol, what cigarette
brand he smokes, medical history. I have a questionnaire printed with
five pages of questions. I got it out of the filing cabinet and
passed it to him.</p>

<p>	"Will you please
fill out this questionnaire and bring it back here day after
tomorrow. That will give me time to check out the local addresses."</p>

<p>	"I've called most
of them," he said curtly, expecting me to take the next plane
for Athens.</p>

<p>	"Of course. But
friends of an M.P. —missing person—are not always honest
with the family. Besides, I daresay some of them have moved or had
their phones disconnected. Right?" He nodded. I put my hands on
the questionnaire. "Some of these questions may seem irrelevant
but they all add up. I found a missing person once from knowing that
he could wriggle his ears. I've noticed that you are left-handed. Is
your son also left-handed?"</p>

<p>	"Yes, he is."</p>

<p>	"You can skip
that question. Do you have a picture of him with you?"</p>

<p>	He handed me a photo.
Jerry was a beautiful kid. Slender, red hair, green eyes far apart, a
wide mouth. Sexy and kinky-looking.</p>

<p>	"Mr. Green, I
want all the photos of him you can find. If I use any I'll have
copies made and return the originals. If he did any painting,
sketching, or writing I'd like to see that too. If he sang or played
an instrument, I want recordings. In fact, any recordings of his
voice. And please bring if possible some article of clothing that
hasn't been dry-cleaned since he wore it."</p>

<p>	"It's true then
that you use uh psychic methods?"</p>

<p>	"I use any
methods that help me to find the missing person. If I can locate him
in my own mind that makes it easier to locate him outside it."</p>

<p>	"My wife is into
psychic things. That's why I came to you. She has an intuition that
something has happened to him and she says only a psychic can find
him."</p>

<p>	That makes two of us,
I thought. He wrote me a check for a thousand dollars. We shook
hands.</p><empty-line /><p>I went right to work.
Jim, my assistant, was out of town on an industrial-espionage case—he
specializes in electronics. So I was on my own. Ordinarily I don't
carry iron on an M.P. case, but this one smelled of danger. I put on
my snub-nosed 38, in a shoulder holster. Then I unlocked a drawer and
put three joints of the best Colombian, laced with hash, into my
pocket. Nothing like a joint to break the ice and stir the memory. I
also took a deck of heroin. It buys more than money sometimes.</p>

<p>	Most of the addresses
were in the SoHo area. That meant lofts, and that often means the
front door is locked. So I started with an address on Sixth Street.</p>

<p>	She opened the door
right away, but she kept the chain on. Her pupils were dilated, her
eyes running, and she was snuffling, waiting for the Man. She looked
at me with hatred.</p>

<p>	I smiled. "Expecting
someone else?"</p>

<p>	"You a cop?"</p>

<p>	"No. I'm a
private investigator hired by the family to find Jerry Green. You
knew him."</p>

<p>	"Look, I don't
have to talk to you."</p>

<p>	"No, you don't
have to. But you might want to." I showed her the deck of
heroin. She undid the chain.</p>

<p>	The place was
filthy—dishes stacked in a sink, cockroaches running over them.
The bathtub was in the kitchen and hadn't been used for a long time.
I sat down gingerly in a chair with the springs showing. I held the
deck in my hand where she could see it. "You got any pictures of
him?"</p>

<p>	She looked at me and
she looked at the heroin. She rummaged in a drawer, and tossed two
pictures onto a coffee table that wobbled. "Those should be
worth something."</p>

<p>	They were. One showed
Jerry in drag, and he made a beautiful girl. The other showed him
standing up naked with a hard-on. "Was he gay?"</p>

<p>	"Sure. He liked
getting fucked by Puerto Ricans and having his picture took."</p>

<p>	"He pay you?"</p>

<p>	"Sure, twenty
bucks. He kept most of the pictures."</p>

<p>	"Where'd he get
the money?"</p>

<p>	"I don't know."</p>

<p>	She was lying. I went
into my regular spiel. "Now look, I'm not a cop. I'm a private
investigator paid by his family. I'm paid to find him, that's all.
He's been missing for two months." I started to put the heroin
back into my pocket and that did it.</p>

<p>	"He was pushing
C."</p>

<p>	I tossed the deck onto
the coffee table. She locked the door behind me.</p><empty-line /><p>Later
that evening, over a joint, I interviewed a nice young gay couple,
who simply <emphasis>adored </emphasis>Jerry.</p>

<p>	"Such a sweet boy
..."</p>

<p>	"So understanding
..."</p>

<p>	"Understanding?"</p>

<p>	"About gay
people. He even marched with us...."</p>

<p>	"And look at the
postcard he sent us from Athens." It was a museum postcard
showing the statue of a nude youth found at Kouros. "Wasn't that
cute of him?"</p>

<p>	Very cute, I thought.</p><empty-line /><p>I interviewed his
steady girl friend, who told me he was all mixed up.</p>

<p>	"He had to get
away from his mother's influence and find himself. We talked it
over."</p><empty-line /><p>I interviewed everyone
I could find in the address book. I talked to waiters and bartenders
all over the SoHo area: Jerry was a nice boy ... polite ... poised
... a bit reserved. None of them had an inkling of his double life as
a coke pusher and a homosexual transvestite. I see I am going to need
some more heroin on this one. That's easy. I know some narco boys who
me a favor. It takes an ounce and a ticket to San Francisco to buy
some names from the junky chick.</p>

<p>	Seek and you shall
find. I nearly found an ice pick in my stomach. Knock and it shall be
opened unto you. Often it wasn't opened unto me. But I finally found
the somebody who: a twenty-year-old Puerto Rican kid named Kiki, very
handsome and quite fond of Jerry in his way. Psychic too, and into
Macambo magic. He told me Jerry had the mark of death on him.</p>

<p>	"What was his
source for the coke?"</p>

<p>	His face closed over.
"I don't know."</p>

<p>	"Can't blame you
for not knowing. May I suggest to you that his source was a federal
narc?"</p>

<p>	His deadpan went
deader. "I didn't tell you anything."</p>

<p>	"Did he hear
voices? Voices giving him orders?"</p>

<p>	"I guess he did.
He was controlled by something."</p>

<p>	I gave him my card.
"If you ever need anything let me know."</p><empty-line /><p>Mr. Green showed up the
next morning with a stack of photos. The questionnaire I had given
him had been neatly filled out on a typewriter. He also brought a
folio of sketches and a green knitted scarf. The scarf reeked of
death.</p>

<p>	I
glanced at the questionnaire. Born April 18, 1951, in Little America,
Wyoming. "Admiral Byrd welcomes you aboard the Deep Freeze
Special." I looked through the photos: Jerry as a baby ... Jerry
on a horse ... Jerry with a wide sunlit grin holding up a string of
trout ... graduation pictures ... Jerry as the Toff in the high
school play <emphasis>A Night at the Inn</emphasis>. They all looked exactly as
they should look. Like he was playing the part expected of him. There
were about fifty recent photos, all looking like Jerry.</p>

<p>	Take
fifty photos of anyone. There will be some photos where the face is
so different you can hardly recognize the subject. I mean most people
have many faces. Jerry had <emphasis>one</emphasis>. Don Juan says anyone who
always looks like the same person isn't a person. He is a person
impersonator.</p>

<p>	I looked at Jerry's
sketches. Good drawing, no talent. Empty and banal as sunlight. There
were also a few poems, so bad I couldn't read them. Needless to say,
I didn't tell Mr. Green what I had found out about Jerry's sex and
drug habits. I just told him that no one I had talked to had heard
from Jerry since his disappearance, and that I was ready to leave for
Athens at once if he still wanted to retain me. Money changed hands.</p><empty-line /><p>At the Athens Hilton I
got Dimitri on the phone and told him I was looking for the Green
boy.</p>

<p>	"Ah yes ... we
have so many of these cases ... our time and resources are limited."</p>

<p>	"I understand.
But I've got a bad feeling about this one. He had some kinky habits."</p>

<p>	"S-M?"</p>

<p>	"Sort of ... and
underworld connections...." I didn't want to mention C over the
phone.</p>

<p>	"If I find
anything out I'll let you know."</p>

<p>	"Thanks. I'm
going out to Spetsai tomorrow to have a look around. Be back on
Thursday...."</p><empty-line /><p>I called Skouras in
Spetsai. He's the tourist agent there. He owns or leases villas and
rents out apartments during the season. He organizes tours. He owns
the discotheque. He is the first man any traveler to Spetsai sees,
and the last, since he is also the agent for transport.</p>

<p>	"Yes, I know
about it. Had a call from Dimitri. Glad to help ay way I can. You
need a room?"</p>

<p>	"If possible I'd
like the room he had."</p>

<p>	"You can have any
room you want ... the season is over."</p><empty-line /><p>For once the hovercraft
was working. I was in luck. The hovercraft takes an hour and the boat
takes six.</p>

<p>	Yes, Skouras
remembered Jerry. Jerry arrived with some young people he'd met on
the boat—two Germans with rucksacks and a Swedish girl with
English boyfriend. They stayed at one of Skouras's villas on the
beach—the end villa, where the road curves out along the sea
wall. I knew the place. I'd stayed there once three years earlier in
1970.</p>

<p>	"Anything special
about the others?"</p>

<p>	"Nothing. Looked
like thousands of other young people who swarm over the islands every
summer. They stayed for a week. The others went on to Lesbos. Jerry
went back to Athens alone."</p>

<p>	Where did they eat?
Where did they take coffee? Skouras knew. He knows everything that
goes on in Spetsai.</p>

<p>	"Go to the
discotheque?"</p>

<p>	"Every night. The
boy Jerry was a good dancer."</p>

<p>	"Anybody in the
villa now?"</p>

<p>	"Just the
caretaker and his wife."</p>

<p>	He
gave me the keys. I noticed a worn copy of <emphasis>The Magus</emphasis> by John
Fowles. As soon as anyone walks into his office, Skouras knows
whether he should lend him the book. He has his orders. Last time I
was there he lent me the book and I read it. Even rode out on a horse
to look at the house of the Magus and fell off the horse on the way
back. I pointed to the book. "By any chance ..."</p>

<p>	He smiled. "Yes.
I lent him the book and he returned it when he left. Said he found it
most interesting."</p>

<p>	"Could I borrow
it again?"</p>

<p>	"Of course."</p><empty-line /><p>The villa stood a
hundred feet from the beach. The apartment was on the second
floor—three bedrooms off a hall, kitchen and bathroom at the
end of the hall, balcony along one side of the building. There was a
musty smell, dank and chilly, blinds down. I pulled up the blinds in
all three bedrooms and selected the middle one, where I had stayed
before. Two beds, two chairs, coat hangers on nails in the wall.</p>

<p>	I switched on an
electric heater and took my recorder out of its case. This is a very
special recorder designed and assembled by my assistant, Jim, and
what it won't pick up isn't there. It is also specially designed for
cut-ins and overlays, and you can switch from Record to Playback
without stopping the machine.</p>

<p>	I
recorded a few minutes in all three rooms. I recorded the toilet
flushing and the shower running. I recorded the water running in the
kitchen sink, the rattle of dishes, and the opening and closing and
hum of the refrigerator. I recorded on the balcony. Now I lay down on
the bed and read some selections from <emphasis>The Magus</emphasis> into the
recorder.</p>

<p>	I
will explain exactly how these recordings are made. I want an hour of
Spetsai: an hour of places where my M.P. has been and the sounds he
has head. But not in sequence. I don't start at the beginning of the
tape and record to the end. I spin the tape back and forth, cutting
in at random so that <emphasis>The Magus</emphasis> may be cut off in the middle of
a word by a flushing toilet, or <emphasis>The Magus</emphasis> may cut into sea
sounds. It's a sort of <emphasis>I Ching</emphasis> or table-tapping procedure. How
random is it actually? Don Juan says that nothing is random to a man
of knowledge: everything he sees or hears is there just at that time
waiting to be seen and heard.</p>

<p>	I get out my camera
and take pictures of the three rooms, the bathroom, and the kitchen.
I take pictures from the balcony. I put the machine back in the case
and go outside, recording around the villa and taking pictures at the
same time: pictures of the villa; a picture of the black cat that
belongs to the caretaker; pictures of the beach, which is empty now
except for a party of hardy Swedes.</p>

<p>	I have lunch in a
little restaurant on the beach where Jerry and his friends used to
eat. Mineral water and a salad. The proprietor remembers me and we
shake hands. Coffee at the waterfront café where Jerry and his
friends took coffee. Record. Take pictures. I cover the post office,
the two kiosks that sell imported cigarettes and newspapers. The one
place I don't record is in Skouras's office. He wouldn't like that. I
can hear him loud and clear: "I'm a landlord and not a
detective. I don't want your M.P. in my office. He's bad news."</p>

<p>	I go back to the villa
by a different route, covering the bicycle rental agency. It is now
three o'clock. A time when Jerry would most likely be in his room
reading. I read some more of The Magus into the recorder with
flushing toilets, running water, my footsteps in the hall, blinds
being raised and lowered. I listen to what I have on tape, with
special attention to the cut-ins. I take a walk along the sea wall
and play the tape back to the sea and the wind.</p>

<p>	Dinner in a restaurant
where Jerry and his friends ate the night they arrived. The
restaurant is recommended by Skouras. I take my time with several
ouzos before a dinner of red snapper and Greek salad, washed down
with retsina. After dinner I go out to the discotheque to record some
of the music Jerry danced to. The scene is really dead. A German
countess is dancing with some local youths.</p><empty-line /><p>Next day there was a
wind and the hovercraft was grounded. I took the noon boat and after
six hours was back in my room at the Hilton.</p>

<p>	I took out a bottle of
Johnny Walker Black Label duty-free scotch and ordered a soda siphon
and ice from Hilton room service. I put Jerry's graduation picture in
a silver frame on the desk, assembled the questionnaire, and put the
tape recorder with an hour of Spetsai beside it. The waiter came in
with the ice and soda siphon.</p>

<p>	"Is that your
son, sir?"</p>

<p>	I said yes because it
was the easy thing to say. I poured myself a small drink and lit a
Senior Service. I started thinking out loud, cutting into the
tape....</p>

<p>	"Suspected to be
involved in some capacity: Marty Blum, a small-time operator with
big-time connections. Was in Athens at or about the time young Jerry
disappeared.</p>

<p>	"Helen and
Van—also in Athens at the time. Van was trying to get a permit
to run a disintoxication clinic on one of the islands. He didn't get
it. Left Athens for Tangier. Left Tangier for New York. Trouble at
immigration. Thought to be in Toronto." What did I know about
these two birds? Plenty. "Doctor Van: age, fifty-seven;
nationality, Canadian. Dope-pushing and abortions sidelines and front
for his real specialty, which is transplant operations. Helen, his
assistant: age, sixty; nationality, Australian. Masseuse,
abortionist, suspected jewel thief and murderess."</p>

<p>	The Countess Minsky
Stalinhof de Gulpa, known as Minny to her friends and sycophants: a
heavy woman like a cold fish under tons of gray shale. "White
Russian and Italian descent. Stratospherically wealthy, near the
billion mark. The source of her wealth: manipulation of commodity
prices. She moves into a poor country like Morocco and buys up basic
commodities like sugar, kerosene, and cooking oil, holds them off the
market in her warehouses, then puts them back on the market at a
higher price. The Countess has squeezed her vast wealth out of the
poorest people. She has other interests than money. She is a very big
operator indeed. She owns immense estates in Chile and Peru and has
some secret laboratories there. She has employed biochemists and
virologists. Indication: genetic experiments and biologic weapons."</p>

<p>	And what of the
Countess de Vile? "De Vile: very wealthy but not Gulpa's strata.
A depraved, passionate and capricious woman, evil as Circe. Extensive
underworld and police contacts. On close terms with Mafia dons and
police chiefs in Italy, New York, Morocco, and South America. A
frequent visitor at the Countess de Gulpa's South American retreat.
Several unsolved missing-person cases, involving boys of Jerry's age,
point to the South American laboratories as terminal."</p>

<p>	I glanced through the
questionnaire. "Medical history: scarlet fever at the age of
four." Now, scarlet fever is a rarity since the introduction of
antibiotics. "Could there have been a misdiagnosis?"</p>

<p>	All
this I was feeding into the recorder in pieces, and a lot more. An
article I had just finished reading when Mr. Green came into my
office. This was an article on head transplants performed on monkeys,
the Sunday <emphasis>Times</emphasis>, December 9, 1973. I now took it out of a
file and read parts of it into the recorder. "Monkeys heads
transplanted onto monkey bodies can now survive for about a week. The
drawing above portrays controversial operation. "Technically a
human head transplant is possible,' Dr. White says, 'but
scientifically there would be no point.'"</p>

<p>	My first meeting with
Mr. Green: the smell of death, and something shifty about him. From
talking to Jerry's friends, I found out that this was a family trait.
They all described him as hard to figure or hard to pin down. Finally
I turned on the TV. I played the tape back at low volume while I
watched an Italian western with Greek subtitles, keeping my attention
on the screen so I was subconsciously hearing the tape. They were
hanging a rustler from horseback when the phone rang.</p>

<p>	It was Dimitri. "Well,
Snide, I think we have found your missing person ... unfortunately."</p>

<p>	"You mean dead?"</p>

<p>	"Yes. Embalmed,
in fact." He paused. "And without his head."</p>

<p>	<emphasis>"What?"</emphasis></p>

<p>	"Yes. Head
severed at the shoulders."</p>

<p>	"Fingerprints
check?"</p>

<p>	"Yes."</p>

<p>	I waited for the rest
of it.</p>

<p>	"Cause of death
is uncertain. Some congestion in the lungs. May have been
strangulation. The body was found in a trunk."</p>

<p>	"Who found
it?"</p><empty-line /><p>	"I did. I happened to be down at the port
double-checking the possibility that the boy may have left by
freighter, and I saw a trunk being carried aboard a ship with
Panamanian registry. Well, something about the way they were carrying
it ... the disposition of the weight, you understand. I had the trunk
returned to customs and opened. The uh method of embalming ...
unusual to say the least. The body was perfectly preserved but no
embalming fluid had been used. It was also completely nude."</p>

<p>	"Can I have a
look?"</p>

<p>	"Of course...."</p><empty-line /><p>The Greek doctor had
studied at Harvard and he spoke perfect English. Various internal
organs were laid out on a white shelf. The body, or what was left of
it, was in a fetal position.</p>

<p>	"Considering that
this boy has been dead at least a month, the internal organs are in a
remarkable state of preservation," said the doctor.</p>

<p>	I looked at the body.
Pubic, rectal and leg hairs were bright red. However, he was redder
than he should have been. I pointed to some red blotches around the
nipples, crotch, thighs and buttocks. "What's that? Looks like
some kind of rash."</p>

<p>	"I was wondering
about that.... Of course it could have been an allergy. Redheads are
particularly liable to allergic reactions, but—" He
paused. "It looks like scarlet fever."</p>

<p>	"We are checking
all hospitals and private clinics for scarlet fever admissions,"
Dimitri put in, "... or any other condition that could produce
such a rash."</p>

<p>	I turned to the
doctor. "Doctor, would you say that the amputation was a
professional job?"</p>

<p>	"Definitely."</p>

<p>	"All questionable
doctors and clinics will be checked," said Dimitri.</p>

<p>	The preservative
seemed to be wearing off, and the body gave off a sweet musky smell
that turned me quite sick. I could see Dimitri was feeling it too,
and so was the doctor.</p>

<p>	"Can I see the
trunk?"</p>

<p>	The trunk was built
like an icebox: a layer of cork, and the inside lined with thin
steel.</p>

<p>	"The steel is
magnetized," Dimitri told me. "Look." he took out his
car keys and they stuck to the side of the trunk.</p>

<p>	"Could this have
had any preservative effect?"</p>

<p>	"The doctor says
no."</p>

<p>	Dimitri drove me back
to the Hilton. "Well, it looks like your case is closed, Mr.
Snide."</p>

<p>	"I guess so ...
any chance of keeping this out of the papers?"</p>

<p>	"Yes. This is not
America. Besides, a thing like this, you understand ..."</p>

<p>	"Bad for the
tourist business."</p>

<p>	"Well, yes."</p>

<p>	I had a call to make
to the next of kin. "Afraid I have some bad news for you, Mr.
Green."</p>

<p>	"Yes?"</p>

<p>	"Well, the boy
has been found."</p>

<p>	"Dead, you mean?"</p>

<p>	"I'm sorry, Mr.
Green...."</p>

<p>	"Was he
murdered?"</p>

<p>	"What makes you
say that?"</p>

<p>	"It's my wife.
She's sort of, well, psychic. She had a dream."</p>

<p>	"I see. Well,
yes, it looks like murder. We're keeping it out of the papers,
because publicity would impede the investigation at this point."</p>

<p>	"I want to retain
you again, Mr. Snide. To find the murderer of my son."</p>

<p>	"Everything is
being done, Mr. Green. The Greek police are quite efficient."</p>

<p>	"We have more
confidence in you."</p>

<p>	"I'm returning to
New York in a few days. I'll contact you as soon as I arrive."</p>

<p>	The trail was a month
old at least. I was fairly sure the murderer or murderers were no
longer in Greece. No point in staying on. But there was something
else to check out on the way back.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>Fever spoor</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>I stop over in London.
There is somebody I want to see there, if I can find him without too
much trouble. Could save me a side trip to Tangier.</p>

<p>	I find him in a gay
bar called the Amigo. He is nattily dressed, with a well-kept beard
and shifty eyes. The Arabs say he has the eyes of a thief. But he has
a rich wife and doesn't need to steal.</p>

<p>	"Well," he
says. "The private eye.... Business or pleasure?"</p>

<p>	I look around. "Only
business would bring me here." I show him Jerry's picture. "He
was in Tangier last summer, I believe."</p>

<p>	He looks at the
picture. "Sure, I remember him. A cock-teaser."</p>

<p>	"Missing-person
case. Remember who he was with?"</p>

<p>	"Some hippie
kids."</p>

<p>	The description sounds
like the kids Jerry was with in Spetsai. Props. "Did he go
anywhere else?"</p>

<p>	"Marrakesh, I
think."</p>

<p>	I am about to finish
my drink and leave.</p>

<p>	"Oh, you remember
Peter Winkler who used to run the English Pub? Did you know he was
dead?"</p>

<p>	I haven't heard, but I
am not much interested. "So? Who or what killed him?"</p>

<p>	"Scarlet fever."</p>

<p>	I nearly spill my
drink. "Look, people don't die of scarlet fever now. In fact,t
hey rarely get it."</p>

<p>	"He was living
out on the mountain ... the Hamilton summer house. It's quite
isolated, you know. Seems he was alone and the phone was out of
order. He tried to walk to the next house down the road and
collapsed. They took him to the English hospital."</p>

<p>	"That would
finish anyone off. And I suppose Doc Peterson was in attendance? Made
the diagnosis and signed the death certificate?"</p>

<p>	"Who else? He's
the only doctor there. But what are you so stirred up about? I never
thought you and Winkler were very close."</p>

<p>	I cool it. "We
weren't. It's just that I started out to be a doctor and I don't like
to see a case botched."</p>

<p>	"I wouldn't say
he botched it. Shot him full of pen strep. Seems he was too far gone
to respond."</p>

<p>	"Yeah. Pen strep
is right for scarlet fever. He must have been practically dead on
arrival."</p>

<p>	"Oh, not quite.
He was in the hospital about twenty-four hours."</p>

<p>	I don't say any more.
I've said too much already. Looks like I'll have to make that side
trip to Tangier.</p><empty-line /><p>I checked into the
Rembrandt and took a taxi to the Marshan. It was 3:00 P.M. when I
rang the doctor's bell. He was a long time coming to the door, and
was not pleased to see me.</p>

<p>	"I'm sorry to
disturb you during the siesta hour, Doctor, but I'm only in town for
a short stay and it's rather important...."</p>

<p>	He was not altogether
mollified but he led me into his office.</p>

<p>	"Doctor Peterson,
I have been retained by the heirs of Peter Winkler to investigate the
circumstances of his death. The fact that he was found unconscious by
the side of a road has led them to speculate that there might be some
question of accidental death. That would mean double indemnity on the
insurance."</p>

<p>	"No question
whatsoever. There wasn't a mark on him—except for the rash,
that is. Well, his pockets were turned inside out, but what do you
expect in a place like this?"</p>

<p>	"You're quite
sure that he died of scarlet fever?"</p>

<p>	"Quite sure. A
classical case. I think that the fever may have caused brain damage
and that is why he didn't respond to antibiotics. Cerebral hemorrhage
may have been a contributory case...."</p>

<p>	"There was
bleeding?"</p>

<p>	"Yes ... from the
nose and mouth."</p>

<p>	"And this
couldn't have been a concussion?"</p>

<p>	"Absolutely no
sign of concussion."</p>

<p>	"Was he delirious
at any time?"</p>

<p>	"Yes. For some
hours."</p>

<p>	"Did he say
anything? Anything that might indicate he had been attacked?"</p>

<p>	"It was gibberish
in some foreign language. I administered morphine to quiet him."</p>

<p>	"I'm sure you did
the right thing, Doctor, and I will report to his heirs that there is
nothing to support a claim of accidental death. That is your
considered opinion?"</p>

<p>	"It is. He died
of scarlet fever and/or complications attendant on scarlet fever."</p>

<p>	I thanked him and
left. I had some more questions, but I was sure he couldn't or
wouldn't answer them. I went back to the hotel and did some work on
the recorder.</p>

<p>	At seven o'clock I
walked over to the English Pub. There was a young Arab behind the bar
whom I recognized as one of Peter's boyfriends. Evidently he had
inherited the business. I showed him Jerry's picture.</p>

<p>	"Oh yes. Mister
Jerry. Peter like him very much. Give him free drinks. He never make
out though. Boy just lead him on."</p>

<p>	I asked about Peter's
death.</p>

<p>	"Very sad. Peter
alone in house. Tell me he want to rest few days."</p>

<p>	"Did he seem
sick?"</p>

<p>	"Not sick. He
just look tired. Mister Jerry gone to Marrakesh and I think Peter a
little sad."</p>

<p>	I could have checked
hospitals in Marrakesh for scarlet fever cases, but I knew already
what I needed to know. I knew why Peter hadn't responded to
antibiotics. He didn't have scarlet fever. He had a virus infection.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>The stranger</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>The
next ay the five boys signed on with <emphasis>The Great White</emphasis> and moved
into the forecastle. Three youths were already there. They introduced
themselves as Bill, Guy, and Adam. Noah noticed that they all had the
same pale faces and fish-eyes as Captain Jones. The forecastle was
clean and newly painted, with a faint hospital smell of carbolic.</p>

<p>	An impish red-haired
boy of about fifteen brings mugs of tea on a tray. "I'm Jerry,
the cabin boy. Anything you want, just let me know. It's a pleasure
to serve you, gentlemen."</p>

<p>	Bill, Guy, and Adam
wash down black pellets with the tea.</p>

<p>	"What's that?"
Brady asks.</p>

<p>	"Oh, just
something to keep out the cold."</p>

<p>	The boys are kept busy
loading cargo supplies. Mr. Thomas gives instructions in a quiet
voice. He seems easygoing and good-natured. But his eyes make Noah
uneasy—they are cold as winter ice.</p><empty-line /><p>Pages from Noah Blake's
diary:</p>

<p>	Tuesday, Feb. 5, 1702:
Today we sailed. Despite Captain Jones's slighting remarks about
freshwater sailing, our experience on the lakes stands us in good
stead. I notice that Guy, Bill, and Adam, though they are very thin
and pale and sick-looking, are good seamen and seem immune to cold
and fatigue.</p>

<p>	An hour before
sailing, a carriage pulled up at the wharf and two people got out and
came on board. I could not see them clearly, for they were wearing
furs with hoods, but I could tell that they were young and looked
much alike. When the ship was clear of the harbor and on course, the
cabin boy brought tea.</p>

<p>	"Two passengers
on board," he told us.</p>

<p>	"Have you seen
them?"</p>

<p>	"Aye, I carried
their luggage to the cabin."</p>

<p>	"And what are
they like?"</p>

<p>	"More like
leprechauns than humans. Green they are, green as shamrock."</p>

<p>	"Green?"</p>

<p>	"Aye, with smooth
greenish faces. Twins, one a boy and one a girl. And rich too. You
can smell the money off them...."</p><empty-line /><p>Feb. 6, 1702: Neither
the two passengers nor the captain has appeared on deck. Bert Hansen
and myself have been given turns at the wheel. The food is good and
plentiful and I have talked with the cook. His name is Charlie Lee.
He is about twenty years old, half-black and half-Chinese. I'm
thinking there is something between him and the cabin boy. We will
dock in New York tomorrow.</p><empty-line /><p>Feb. 7, 1702: Too late
to dock. We are riding at anchor. There is naught to be done, and
after the evening meal we had a talk with Guy, Adam, and Bill. I have
found out what it is that they take with their tea night and morning:
opium. They have enough to last them the voyage.</p>

<p>	"And should we
need more, we have but to ask the Captain," said Guy.</p>

<p>	"Sure and he
should be made of the stuff," Sean Brady put in. "Seeing
his name is Opium Jones."</p>

<p>	It seems they have
shipped with Captain Jones before. "He pays double because he
only wants certain type people on his ship."</p>

<p>	"And what type
would that be?"</p>

<p>	"Them as do the
work, mind their own business, and keep their mouths shut to
outsiders."</p><empty-line /><p>Feb. 8, 1702: Today we
docked in New York. Captain Jones appeared on deck and guided the
ship into the harbor. I will say for him he knows his business when
he chooses to mind it. A carriage was waiting at the pier and the two
passengers got in and were driven away.</p>

<p>	We were kept busy most
of the day loading and unloading cargo under the supervision of Mr.
Thomas. Captain Jones went ashore on business of some kind. In the
late afternoon we were allowed ashore. There is more bustle here than
in Boston and more ships, of course. We were immediately set upon by
panderers extolling the beauty and sound condition of their whores.
When we told them to be off and fuck their wares they showered us
with insults from a safe distance.</p>

<p>	I have a letter to the
Pembertons, the parents of my step-mother, and father impressed on me
the importance of paying my respects and instructed me in how to
conduct myself. It seems that the Pemberton family is well known
here, and I had no trouble finding the house, which is of red brick
and very imposing, with four stories.</p>

<p>	I rang the bell and a
servant came to the door and asked my business in somewhat peremptory
tones. I presented him with the letter. He told me to wait and went
inside. When he returned a few minutes later, his manner was quite
respectful. He told me that Mr. Pemberton would be happy to entertain
me for dinner the following night at eight o'clock.</p><empty-line /><p>Feb. 9, 1702: This
night I had dinner with the Pembertons. Arriving a few minutes early
I walked up and down until the chimes sounded eight. My father had
admonished me always to be punctual for appointments and never under
any circumstances to be early. The servant showed me into an ornately
furnished room with portraits and a marble fireplace.</p>

<p>	Mr. Pemberton greeted
me most politely. He is a trim smallish man with white hair and
twinkling blue eyes. He then presented me to his wife, who extended a
hand without getting up, smiling as though it hurt her to do so. I
took an immediate dislike to her, which I am sure was reciprocated.</p>

<p>	The
other people present, I soon realized, were none other than the
passengers on board <emphasis>The Great White</emphasis>: two of the strangest and
most beautiful people I have ever seen. They are twins—one a
boy, the other a girl—about twenty years old. They have
greenish complexions, straight black hair, and jet-black eyes. Both
possess such ease and grace of manner that I was quite dazzled. The
names I believe are Juan and Maria Cocuera de Fuentes. When I shook
hands with the boy a tremor passed through me and I was glad of the
diversion when Mr. Pemberton offered me a glass of sherry. While we
were having the sherry, a Mr. Vermer was announced. He is as portly
as Mr. Pemberton is trim, and gives a great impression of wealth and
power.</p>

<p>	Shortly thereafter
dinner was served. Mr. Pemberton took the head of the table, with Mr.
Vermer on his right and Maria de Fuentes on his left. I was seated
opposite Juan de Fuentes, with Mrs. Pemberton on my right—though
I would gladly have been as far away from her as possible. The de
Fuentes twins had come from Mexico and were on their way to Vera
Cruz. The talk was mostly about business, trade, mining, and the
produce of Mexico.</p>

<p>	Maria spoke in her
cool clear voice.... "Crops now grown only in the Middle and Far
East could be introduced, since the soil and climate is suitable."</p>

<p>	I noted that the
Permbertons and Mr. Vermer defer to the twins and listen respectfully
to their opinions. Several times Mr. Pemberton addressed a question
to me, and I answered briefly and politely, as my father had
instructed me. When I told him I planned to be a sea captain he
looked a little vague and distracted and said that the sea was good
thing for a young man ... to be sure, a master's certificate would do
no harm. However, the opportunities in the family business were not
to be overlooked.</p>

<p>	Mr.
Vermer expressed concern with regard to the political instability of
Mexico. Maria de Fuentes replied that the introduction of <emphasis>suitable
crops</emphasis> would undoubtedly produce a tranquilizing and stabilizing
effect. She has a way of underscoring certain words with special
import. Mr. Vermer nodded and said, "Ah yes, sound economy
brings sound politics."</p>

<p>	I had a feeling that
the talk would have been more open if I had not been present. Why
then, I asked myself, had I been invited? The words of my father came
back to me: "In the course of any meeting, try to discover what
it is that is wanted from you." While I could not decide what it
was, I knew that something very definite was wanted and expected from
me. I surmised further that Mrs. Pemberton was less convinced of my
potential usefulness than her husband, and that she considered my
presence at the dinner table a hindrance and a waste of time.</p>

<p>	At one point Juan de
Fuentes looked straight into my eyes and once again I felt a tremor
run through me and for a second had a most curious impression the we
were alone at the table.</p>

<p>	After dinner, I
excused myself to return to the ship since we will be sailing before
noon.</p><empty-line /><p>Feb. 10, 1702: The
twins arrived shortly before sailing. Captain Jones took the wheel on
leaving the harbor. We are heading south with a good wind. Weather
very damp and cold.</p><empty-line /><p>Feb. 11, 1702: This
morning I awoke with a sore throat, my head throbbing and feverish,
and a congestion in my lungs—feeling barely able to rise from
my bunk. Adam smiled and told me that the remedy was to hand. He
carefully measured out six drops of opium tincture and I downed it
with hot tea. In a few minutes a feeling of warmth and comfort spread
from the back of my neck through my body. The soreness in my throat
and the aching in my head disappeared as if by magic. I have been
able to take my watch without difficulty. When I came in to sleep,
the dose was repeated. There is an extraordinary clarity in my
thoughts. I am unable to sleep. Writing this by candle.</p>

<p>	I am asking myself
where I came from, how I got here, and who I am. From earliest memory
I have felt myself a stranger in the village of Harbor Point where I
was born. Who was I? I remember mourning doves calling from the woods
in summer dawn, and the long cold shut-in winters. Who was I? The
stranger was footsteps in the snow a long time ago.</p>

<p>	And who are the
others—Brady, Hansen, Paco, Todd? Strangers like myself. I
think that we came from another world and have been stranded here
like mariners on some barren and hostile shore. I never felt that
what we did together was wrong, but I fully understood the necessity
and wisdom of concealing it from the villagers. Now that there is no
need for concealment, I feel as if this ship is the home I had left
and thought never to find again. But the voyage will end of course,
and what then?</p>

<p>	I know that my father
will shortly be a wealthy man and that I could become, in course of
time, wealthy myself. The prospect holds little appeal. Of what use
is wealth if I must conform to customs that are as meaningless to me
as they are obstructive of my true inclination and desires? I am
minded to seek my fortunes in the Red Sea or in South America.
Perhaps I could find employment with the de Fuentes family.</p>

<p>	Now the face of Juan
drifts before my eyes, and divorced by the effects of opium from the
urgings and pricklings of lust I can examine the vision
dispassionately. I feel not only attraction but kinship. He too is a
stranger, but he moves with ease and confidence among the
terrestrials.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>Shore leave</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>Feb. 12, 1702: For some
reason we will not dock at Charleston as planned. The weather is
milder each day.</p>

<p>	The de Fuentes twins
now walk about the deck familiarizing themselves with all the
workings and parts of the ship. Everything they do or say seems to
have some hidden purpose. Juan has asked me many questions relative
to my trade as a gunsmith. Would it be possible to shoot arrows from
a gun? I replied that it would and suddenly saw a picture of Indians
attacking a settlement with arrows tipped with burning pitch. I
cannot recall where I saw this picture before, probably in Boston. As
the picture flashed through my mind Juan nodded and smiled and walked
away. His twin sister has the manner and directness of a man, with
none of the coy enticing ways usually found in her sex. In any case
female blandishments would here fall on barren soil. Yet I must
confess myself more attracted to her than to any woman I have yet
seen.</p><empty-line /><p>Feb. 13, 1702: Good
winds and fair weather continue. We no longer need our greatcoats.</p><empty-line /><p>Feb. 14, 1702: We are
now off the coast of Florida and seldom out of sight of land since
there are many islands. Dolphins leap about the prow and flying fish
scatter before us in silver showers. We are now able to work without
shirts but Mr. Thomas has cautioned us to be careful of sunburn and
to expose ourselves only for minutes at a time. Captain Jones appears
on deck, scanning the horizon through his telescope. I think he plans
to put in at one of the islands for fresh water and provisions.</p><empty-line /><p>Feb. 15, 1702: Mr.
Thomas's warning, both Bert and myself have painful sunburns from the
waist up, owing to our fair complexions, whereas Clinch, Sean, and
Paco are unaffected. Bill, Guy, and Adam never take their shirts off.
Charlie Lee, the cook, has some skill as physician though without
formal training. He has given us an ointment to rub on our bodies,
which has afforded considerable relief, and we have both taken some
drops of opium tincture. Adam has given me a small bottle and showed
me how to measure out the correct dose. He tells me the amount he
takes would make us deathly sick and could be lethal.</p><empty-line /><p>Feb. 16, 1702: I am now
recovered from the sunburn and my body is beginning to acquire a
protective tan. This morning we all gathered at the rail to witness a
great commotion in the water a few hundred yards ahead, occasioned by
mackerel leaping to escape larger fish. Mr. Thomas gave the order to
lower sail and issued fishing poles with spoons and triple hooks.</p>

<p>	In a short time a
number of great fish were flapping on the deck. These fish are known
as yellowtails and are highly esteemed for the table. We were kept
busy cleaning the fish, at which of course we are adept from our
experience on the Great Lakes. Some were reserved for immediate use
and the others salted and laid away. After the blood was washed from
the decks we hoisted sail and proceeded on our way. The fresh fish
has provided a most welcome change from a diet of salt cod and
cornmeal, although the flavour is not as delicate as fish from fresh
water.</p><empty-line /><p>Feb. 18, 1702: Dreamed
this morning I was in a large workshop with tools, a forge, and gun
parts scattered on a bench. I was examining a gun with a number of
barrels welded together. I was trying to arrive at a method of firing
the barrels in sequence. Juan was standing to one side and behind me.
He pointed to an iron wheel with a handle and said something I did
not catch because at this moment Clinch Todd came off his watch and
awakened me, grumbling that we had ejaculated all over his blankets.</p>

<p>	The wind has fallen
and we are moving now at a few knots an hour.</p><empty-line /><p>*</p><empty-line /><p>Feb. 19, 20, 21, 1702:
We are almost becalmed and take advantage of the slow movement to
fish from the deck. I hooked a shark and the pole was torn from my
hands and lost.</p>

<p>	We seem to float on a
sea of glass, like a painted ship. Tempers are short. Brady and Mr.
Thomas got into an altercation and I thought they would come to
blows.</p><empty-line /><p>Feb. 22, 1702: Today we
put ashore on an uninhabited island to take on water and what
provisions we could find. Captain Jones had spotted a stream through
his telescope. We anchored in a bay between two points of land about
two hundred yards from a beach with coconut palms behind it. The
water here is so clear that you can see fish at a considerable depth.
We are sure at least to find abundant coconuts.</p>

<p>	Mr. Thomas, Bert
Hansen, Clinch Todd, Paco, Jerry the cabin boy and myself put ashore
in a boat loaded with water kegs. We filled the kegs with fresh water
and loaded them into the boat. Todd and Paco rowed back to the ship
and returned with empty kegs. When sufficient water had been
collected, we filled the boat a number of times with coconuts. It was
now after noon. Mr. Thomas then gave us the rest of the day off to
explore the island, admonishing us to be back on the beach before
sundown. Before returning to the ship he issued to each of us a
cutlass for the unlikely event we should encounter dangerous animals
or hidden natives.</p>

<p>	Following
the stream we climbed to the summit of the island, a distance of
about six hundred feet. From the summit we had a fine view of the
whole island. <emphasis>The Great White</emphasis> appeared at that distance like a
toy. On the far side of the island are a number of small bays and
inlets, and we made our way down to a little beach surrounded on both
sides by overhanging rocks. Here we stripped off our clothes and swam
in the bay for half an hour, being careful not to venture too far out
for fear of sharks. The water is wonderfully warm and buoyant, quite
unlike the swimming in freshwater lakes.</p>

<p>	Feeling hunger after
our swim, we put out lines which we had brought and soon took a
number of the fish known as red snapper, each one two or three pounds
in weight. Five fish we fried in a pan, leaving the others on a
string through the gills in the water. This most delectable fish we
ate with our fingers, washing the meat down with coconut milk.</p>

<p>	Feeling a great
drowsiness after eating, we all lay down naked in the shade of a
rock, Jerry with his head on my stomach and I in turn resting my head
on Bert Hansen's stomach. Clinch and Paco lay on their backs, side by
side, with an arm around the other's shoulders. The heat, our full
stomachs, and the sound of gently lapping waves put us into a light
sleep which lasted for about an hour.</p>

<p>	I woke with a strong
erection and found my companions in the same condition. We stood  up
stretching and comparing.</p>

<p>	The breeze was rising
and it was getting towards sundown. We put out our lines and caught
enough fish to make a good string, and made our way back to the beach
as speedily as possible. Jerry kept us all laughing, slashing with
his cutlass at trees and branches with fierce snarls and pirate
cries. Adam and Bill rowed ashore and took us back to the ship. Sail
was raised and we got under way.</p>

<p>	While we were gone a
number of different fish had been taken from the ship, and for supper
we had a spicy fish stew with grated coconut.</p>

<p>	A shout from Jerry
while were eating brought us all to the rail, where we witnessed a
wondrous sight known as the green flash, which occurs a moment after
sunset. The whole western sky lit up a brilliant luminous green.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>Lettre de
marque</p><empty-line /><p>Feb. 28, 1702: Today we
were captured by pirates. At five o'clock in the afternoon a heavily
armed ship came abreast of us flying the Dutch flag, which was then
lowered and the black pirate flag raised. We were carrying no cannon,
so resistance was out of the question and Captain Jones immediately
gave the order to raise the flag of truce. We all gathered on deck,
including the de Fuentes twins, who were impassive as always,
scanning the pirate ship critically as if to assess its worth.</p>

<p>	Shortly thereafter a
boat was lowered and it rowed towards us. Standing in the stern was a
slim blond youth, his gold-braided coat glittering in the sun. Beside
him was a youth in short gray pants and shirt with a red scarf around
his neck. The boat was rowed by what appeared to be a crew of women,
singing as they rowed and turning towards us to leer and wink with
their painted faces.</p>

<p>	The companionway was
lowered and the "women" scrambled aboard with the agility
of monkeys and posted themselves about the deck with muskets and
cutlasses. I perceived that they were, in fact, handsome youths in
women's garb, their costumes being Oriental, of colored silks and
brocade. The two youths then stepped on board, the one with his
gold-braided coat open at the waist to show his slender brown chest
and stomach, a brace of pistols inlaid with silver, and a cutlass at
his belt. He was a striking figure: blond hair tied in a knot at the
back of his head, aristocratic and well-formed features, possessing a
most lordly bearing and grace of manner.</p>

<p>	Captain
Jones stepped forward. "I am Captain Jones, master of <emphasis>The
Great White</emphasis>."</p>

<p>	"And
I am Captain Strobe, second in command on <emphasis>The Siren</emphasis>,"
said the youth.</p>

<p>	They shook hands most
amiably and if I am any judge are not strangers to each other. I was
immediately convinced that the "capture" had been
prearranged between them. Strobe then received the keys to the
armory. Turning to us, he assured us that we had nothing to fear for
our lives. He would take over the conduct of he ship and set its
course, his men acting under the orders of Mr. Kelley, the
quartermaster. He indicated the youth in gray shorts, who was leaning
against the rail immobile as a statue, his face without expression,
his pale gray eyes turned up towards the rigging. We would continue
to act under the orders of Mr. Thomas.</p>

<p>	Several
of the boys descended to the boat and began passing up seabags
containing apparently the personal effects of the boarding crew. When
the boat was cleared, Strobe conducted Captain Jones and the de
Fuentes twins to the companionway and two boys rowed them back to <emphasis>The
Siren</emphasis>. Captain Strobe then opened a small keg of rum and the boys
produced tankards from their bags. Approaching us in a purposeful and
insinuating manner, wriggling their buttocks, they passed around
little clay pipes.</p>

<p>	"Hashish. Very
good."</p>

<p>	When it came to my
turn to smoke it caused me to cough greatly but soon I felt a lifting
of my spirits and a vividness of pictures in my mind—together
with a prickling in my groin and buttocks. Drums and flutes appeared
and the boys began to dance and as they danced stripped off their
clothes until they were dancing stark naked on the brightly colored
silk scarves and dresses strewn about the deck. Captain Strobe stood
on the poop deck playing a silver flute, the notes seeming to fall
from a distant star. Only Mr. Thomas, at Strobe's side, seemed
totally unconcerned, and for a second his bulky form was transparent
before my eyes—probably an illusion produced by the drug.</p>

<p>	Mr.
Thomas was watching <emphasis>The Siren</emphasis> through his telescope. Finally,
having received a signal that their sails were set, he gave the order
to hoist sail on <emphasis>The Great White</emphasis>. Surprisingly enough we were
able to carry out the order with no difficulty, the effect of hashish
being such that one can shift easily from one activity to another.
Kelley gave the same order in an unknown tongue to the dancing boys,
who now acted in a seamanlike manner—some naked, some with
scarfs twisted around their hips—as they went about their
duties singing strange songs. So sails were speedily set and we got
under way, for where I did not know.</p><empty-line /><p>Some of the boys have
hammocks and sleep on deck, but we are often two to a bunk in the
forecastle. Since we now have a double crew, there is much time with
nothing to do, and I have been able to acquaint myself to some extent
with the strange history of these transvestite boys.</p>

<p>	Some
of them are dancing boys from Morocco, others from Tripoli,
Madagascar, and Central Africa. There are a few from India and the
East Indies who have served on pirate vessels in the Red Sea, where
they preyed on merchant vessels and other pirates alike, the method
of operation being this: some would join the crew of a ship, selling
their favors and insinuating themselves into key positions. Then the
crew sights an apparently unarmed vessel carrying a cargo of
beautiful women all singing and dancing lewdly and promising the
mariners their bodies. Once on board the "women" pull out
hidden pistols and cutlasses, while their accomplices on shipboard do
the same, and The Siren now uncovers its cannons—so that the
ship would often be taken without the loss of a single life. Often
the boys would sign on as cooks—at which trade they all
excel—and then drug the entire crew. However, word of their
operations spread rapidly and they are now fleeing from pirates and
naval patrols alike, having as the French say, <emphasis>brûlé</emphasis>—burnt
down—the Red Sea area.</p><empty-line /><p>Kelley told me his
story. He started his career as a merchant seaman. In the course of
an argument he killed the quartermaster, for which he was tried and
sentenced to hang. His ship at that time was in the harbor of
Tangier. The sentence was carried out in the marketplace, but some
pirates who were present cut him down, carried him to their ship, and
revived him. It was thought that a man who had been hanged and
brought back to life would not only bring luck to their venture but
also ensure protection against the fate from which he had been
rescued. While he was still insensible the pirates rubbed red ink
into the hemp marks, so that he seemed to have a red rope always
around his neck.</p>

<p>	The pirate ship was
commanded by Skipper Nordenholz, a renegade from the Dutch Navy who
was still able to pass his ship as an honest merchant vessel flying
the Dutch flag. Strobe was second in command. Barely had they left
Tangier headed for the Red Sea via the Cape of Good Hope when a
mutiny broke out. The crew was in disagreement as to the destination,
being minded to head for the West Indies. They had also conceived a
contempt for Strobe as an effeminate dandy. After he had killed five
of the ringleaders they were forced to revise this opinion. The
mutinous crew was then put ashore and a crew of acrobats and dancing
boys taken on, since Nordenholz had already devised a way in which
they could be put to use.</p>

<p>	Kelley
claims to have learned the secrets of death on the gallows, which
gives him invincible skill as a swordsman and such sexual prowess
that no man or woman can resist him, with the exception of Captain
Strobe, whom he regards as more than human. <emphasis>"Voici ma lettre
de marque,"</emphasis> he says, running his fingers along the rope
mark. (A letter of marque was issued to privateers by their
government, authorizing them to prey on enemy vessels in the capacity
of accredited combatants, and thus distinguishing them from common
pirates. Such a letter often, but by no means always, saved the
bearer from the gallows.) Kelley tells me that the mere sight of his
hemp marks instills in adversaries a weakness and terror equal to the
apparition of Death Himself.</p>

<p>	I asked Kelley what it
feels like to be hanged.</p>

<p>	"At first I was
sensible of very great pain due to the weight of my body and felt my
spirits in a strange commotion violently pressed upwards. After they
reached my head, I saw a bright blaze of light which seemed to go out
at my eyes with a flash. Then I lost all sense of pain. But after I
was cut down, I felt such intolerable pain from the prickings and
shootings as my blood and spirits returned that I wished those who
cut me down could have been hanged."*</p><empty-line /><p>*

how I find time to write this account on a sea voyage in a crowded
forecastle. The answer is that I made very short notes each day, with
the intent of expanding them later. I now have two hours of leisure
each day to reconstruct a narrative from these notes, since Strobe
has placed a desk and writing material at my disposal, being
interested for some reason in printing my account.</p><empty-line /><p>Each evening all the

<p>	Since there is plenty
of powder and shot on board, there have been a few contests with
pistols and muskets. I have won some gold, being careful not to best

the Greens from my loft. I've put $5,000 worth of security into this
space, The windows are shatterproof glass with rolling bars. The door
is two inches of solid steel from an old bank vault. It gives you a
safe feeling, like being in Switzerland.</p>

<p>	Mr.
Green can see me right away. He gives an address on Spring Street.
Middle-class loft ... big modern kitchen ... Siamese cat ... plants.
Mrs. Green is a beautiful woman, red hair, green eyes, a faraway
dreamy look. I notice <emphasis>Journeys out of the Body</emphasis>, <emphasis>Psychic
Discoveries Behind the Iron Curtain</emphasis>, the Castaneda books. Mr.
Green mixes me a Chivas Regal.</p>

<p>	I clarify my
position...."Private investigator...no authority to make an
arrest ... I can only pass evidence along to the local
police....Frankly, in this case I can't hold out much hope of
obtaining an arrest, let alone a conviction."</p>

<p>	"We still want to
retain you."</p>

<p>	"Why, exactly?"</p>

<p>	"We want to know
the truth," said Mrs. Green. "Whether the killers can be
brought to trial or not."</p>

<p>	I pull out the
questionnaire with Jerry's medical history. "It says here that
Jerry had scarlet fever at the age of four."</p>

<p>	"Yes. We were
living in Saint Louis at the time," said Mrs. Green.</p>

<p>	"Who was the
doctor?"</p>

<p>	"Old Doctor
Greenbaum. He lived next door."</p>

<p>	"Is he still
alive?"</p>

<p>	"No, he died ten
years ago."</p>

<p>	"And he made the
diagnosis?"</p>

<p>	"Yes."</p>

<p>	"Would you say
that he was a competent diagnostician?"</p>

<p>	"Not really,"
said Mr. Green. "But why is this important?"</p>

<p>	"Jerry apparently
had an attack of scarlet fever or something similar shortly before he
was killed." I turned to Mrs. Green. "Do you remember the
details? How the illness started?"</p>

<p>	Why, yes. It was a
Thursday and he had taken a ride with an English governess we had
them. When he got back he was shivering and feverish and he had a
rash. I thought it was measles and called Doctor Greenbaum. He said
it wasn't a measles rash, that it was probably a light case of
scarlet fever. He prescribed Aureomycin and the fever went away in a
few days."</p>

<p>	"Was Jerry
delirious at any time during this illness?"</p>

<p>	"Yes, as a matter
of fact he was. He seemed quite frightened and talked about 'animals
in the wall.'"</p>

<p>	"Do you remember
what animals, Mrs. Green?"</p>

<p>	"He mentioned a
giraffe and a kangaroo."</p>

<p>	"Do you remember
anything else?"</p>

<p>	"...
Yes," she said after a pause. "There was a strange smell in
the room ... sort of a musky smell ... like a <emphasis>zoo</emphasis>."</p>

<p>	"Did Doctor
Greenbaum comment on this odor?"</p>

<p>	"No, I think he
had a cold at the time."</p>

<p>	"Did you notice
it, Mr. Green?"</p>

<p>	"Well, yes, it
was on the sheets and blankets when we sent them to the cleaners....
Exactly how was Jerry killed, Mr. Snide?"</p>

<p>	"A massive
overdose of heroin."</p>

<p>	"He wasn't—"</p>

<p>	"No, he wasn't an
addict, and the Greek police are convinced the heroin was not
self-administered."</p>

<p>	"Do you have any
idea why he would have been murdered?"</p>

<p>	"I'm not at all
sure, Mr. Green. It could have been a case of mistaken identity."</p><empty-line /><p>When I got to the
office the next day my assistant, Jim Brady, was already there,
having come straight from the airport. He is very slim, six feet, 135
pounds, black Irish. Actually he is twenty-eight but he looks
eighteen, and often has to show his I.D. card to be served in a bar.
He handed me a packet from Athens: a photograph, and a message from
Dimitri typed on yellow paper in telegraph style:</p><empty-line /><p>HAVE FOUND VILLA WHERE
JERRY GREEN WAS KILLED STOP ON MAINLAND FORTY MILES FROM ATHENS STOP
HEAD STILL MISSING STOP VILLA RENTED THROUGH LONDON TRAVEL AGENCY
STOP FALSE NAMES STOP</p>

<p>DIMITRI</p><empty-line /><p>The photo showed a bare
high-ceiling room with exposed beams. There was a heavy iron
lantern-hook in one beam. Dimitri had circled this hook in white ink
and had written under it: "Traces of rope fiber."</p>

<p>	"A Mr. Everson
called," said Jim. "His son is missing. I made an
appointment."</p>

<p>	"Where is he
missing?"</p>

<p>	"In Mexico. A
Mayan archeologist. Missing six weeks. I sent Mr. Everson the
questionnaire and asked him for pictures of the boy."</p>

<p>	"Good." I
had no special feeling about this case, but it was taking me in the
direction I wanted to go.</p><empty-line /><p>Back at the loft we
decided to try some sex magic. According to psychic dogma, sex itself
is incidental and should be subordinated to the intent of the ritual.
But I don't believe in rules. What happens, happens.</p>

<p>	The altar is set up
for an Egyptian rite timed for sunset, which is in ten minutes. It is
a slab of white marble about three feet square. We mark out the
cardinal points. A hyacinth in a pot for earth: North. A red candle
for fire: South. An alabaster bowl of water for water: East. A glyph
in gold on white parchment for air: West. We then put up the glyphs
for the rite, in gold on white parchment, on the west wall, since
this is the sundown rite and we are facing west. Also we place on the
altar a bowl of water, a bowl of milk, an incense burner, some rose
essence, and a sprig of mint.</p>

<p>	All set, we strip down
to sky clothes and we are both stiff before we can get our clothes
off. I pick up an ivory wand and draw a circle around our bodies
while we both intone translations of the rite, reading from the
glyphs on the wall.</p>

<p>	"Let the Shining
Ones not have power over me." Jim reads it like the Catholic
litany and we are both laughing.</p>

<p>	"I have purified
myself."</p>

<p>	We dip water from the
bowl and touch our foreheads.</p>

<p>	"I have anointed
myself with the unguents."</p>

<p>	We dip the special
ointment out of an alabaster jar, touching foreheads, insides of the
wrists, and the base of the spine, since the rite will have a sexual
climax.</p>

<p>	"I bring to you
perfume and incense."</p>

<p>	We add more incense, a
few drops of rose oil, and a pinch of benzoin to the burner.</p>

<p>	We pay homage to the
four cardinal points as we invoke Set instead of Khentamentiu, since
this is in some sense a black ritual. It is now exactly the hour of
sunset, and we pay homage to Tem, since, Ra, in his setting, takes
that name. We make lustrations with water and milk to the cardinal
points, dipping a mint sprig into the bowls as we invoke the shining
elementals. It is time now for the ritual climax, in which the gods
possess our bodies and the magical incantation is projected in the
moment of orgasm and visualized as an outpouring of liquid gold.</p>

<p>	"My phallus is
that of Amsu."</p>

<p>	I bend over and Jim
rubs the ointment up my ass and slides his cock in. A roaring sound
in my ears as pictures and tapes swirl in my brain. Shadowy figures
rise beyond the candlelight: the goddess Ix Tab, patroness of those
who hang themselves ... a vista of gallows and burning cities from
Bosch ... Set ... Osiris ... smell of the sea ... Jerry hanging naked
from the beam. A sweet rotten red musky metal smell swirls round our
bodies palpable as a haze, and as I start to ejaculate, the room gets
lighter. At first I think the candles have flared up and then I see
Jerry standing there naked, his body radiating light. There is a
skeleton grin on his face, which fades to the enigmatic smile on the
statues of archaic Greek youths and then he changes into Dimitri,
with a quizzical amused expression.</p>

<p>	So we send the Shining
Ones home and go to bed.</p><empty-line /><p>"Why do you thing
the head was cut off?" asks Jim.</p>

<p>	"Obvious reason:
to obscure the cause of death in case the body was found. But they
didn't figure on the body being found. There was some special purpose
they had in mind, to use both the head and the body." Drawings
of transplanted monkey heads flash in front of my eyes.</p>

<p>	"Where do you
think the head is now?"</p>

<p>	"In New York."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>Horse hattock</p>

<p>to ride to ride</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>Next day when we got to
the office there was a telegram from Dimitri:</p>

<p>HAVE SUSPECT IN CUSTODY
WHO WITNESSED DEATH OF JERRY GREEN STOP WIRE IF WISH TO INTERVIEW
SUSPECT</p>

<p>We took the next plane
to Athens and checked into the Hilton. Dimitri sent a car for us.</p>

<p>	Jim was a bit stiff
when they shook hands in Dimitri's air-conditioned office ...
wall-to-wall blue carpet, a desk, leather-covered chairs, a picture
of the Parthenon on the wall, everything neat and impersonal as a
room in the Hilton.</p>

<p>	Dimitri raised one
eyebrow. "I infer you disapprove of our politics, Mr. Brady. For
myself I disapprove of any politics. Please understand that I stand
to gain nothing from this investigation. My political superiors want
the whole thing dropped ... a few degenerate foreigners ... it's bad
for the tourist business."</p>

<p>	Jim blushed sulkily
and looked at his shoes and turned one foot sideways.</p>

<p>	"What about this
witness you got?" I asked.</p>

<p>	Dimitri leaned back in
his chair behind the desk and put the tips of his fingers together.
"Ah yes—Adam North, the perfect witness. Survived his
perfection because he was in custody. On the morning that the Green
boy was killed, September eighteenth, young North was arrested with a
quarter-ounce of heroin in his possession. When I saw the laboratory
report I ordered him placed in isolation. The heroin he had been
buying from street pushers was about ten percent. This was almost one
hundred percent. It would have killed him in a matter of seconds."</p>

<p>	"Well, if they
would kill him to shut him up about something, why let him know about
it in the first place?" Jim asked.</p>

<p>	"A searching
question. You see, he was a sort of camera from which a film could be
withdrawn and developed. But first the bare bones, later the meat.
Adam North had been approached by someone fitting"—Dimitri
glanced at me—"your description of Marty Blum, and offered
a quarter-ounce of heroin plus a thousand-dollar bonus to be paid in
two installments to witness a magical ritual involving a simulated
execution. He was suspicious."</p>

<p>	Dimitri
turned on a tape recorder. "Why <emphasis>me</emphasis>?" said a stupid
surly young voice. It went on.</p>

<p>	"Sot
his character from a comic strip says I am a perfect. 'A perfect
<emphasis>what</emphasis>?' I ask him. 'A perfect witness,' he tells me. He has
five C-notes in his hand , 'Well, all right,' I say. 'But there is a
condition,' he says. 'You must promise to refrain from heroin or any
other drug for three days prior to the ceremony. You have to be in a
pure condition.' 'Promise on my scout's honor,' I told him and he
lays the bread on me. 'But one more thing,' he says. He gives me a
color picture of a kid with red hair who looks sorta like me. 'This
is the subject. You will concentrate on this picture for the next
three days.' So I tell him 'Sure' and split. And would you believe
it, with five hundred cools in my pocket I can't score for shit
nowhere no way. So when the chauffeur comes to pick me up in a
Daimler I am sick as a dog."</p>

<p>	Dimitri shuts off the
tape recorder. "He was driven to a villa outside Athens where he
witnessed a bizarre ceremony culminating in the hanging of the Green
boy. Back in Athens he was given the quarter-ounce of heroin. He was
on his way back to his girl friend's apartment when the arrest was
made."</p>

<p>	"It still doesn't
make any sense," Jim said. "They drag him in as a witness,
God knows why, then knock him to shut him up."</p>

<p>	"They
did not intend to <emphasis>shut</emphasis> him up. They intended to <emphasis>open</emphasis>
him and extract the film. Adam North was a perfect witness. He is
Jerry's age, born on the same day, and resembles him enough to be a
twin brother. You are acquainted with the symptoms of heroin
withdrawal ... the painful intensity of impressions, light fever,
spontaneous orgasms ... a sensitized film. And a heroin overdose is
the easiest of deaths, so the pictures registered on the sensitized
withdrawal film come off without distortion in a heroin O.D."</p>

<p>	"I see,"
said Jim.</p>

<p>	"It's all here on
the tape, but I think you would like to see this boy. He is, I should
tell you, retarded."</p><empty-line /><p>As we are going down in
the elevator, Dimitri continued. "There is reason to suspect a
latent psychosis, masked by his addiction."</p>

<p>	"Is he receiving
any medication?" I asked.</p>

<p>	"Yes—methadone,
orally. I don't want his disorder to surface here."</p><empty-line /><p>	"You
mean that he could become a public charge?" I asked.</p>

<p>"More
than that—he could become a sanitary hazard."</p>

<p>	We saw Adam North in
one of the interrogation rooms, under fluorescent lights. A table, a
tape recorder, four chairs. He was a handsome blond kid with green
eyes. The resemblance to Jerry was remarkable. However, while Jerry
was described as very bright and quick, this boy had a slack,
vacuous, stupid look about him, sleepy and sullen like a lizard
resentfully aroused from hibernation. Dimitri explained that we were
investigators hired by Jerry's family, and we had a few questions.
The boy looked down at the table in front of him and said nothing.</p>

<p>	"This man who
offered you the quarter-ounce of H. You'd seen him before?" I
asked.</p>

<p>	"Yeah. When I
first came here he steered me to a score. I figure he is creaming off
a percentage."</p>

<p>	"What did he look
like?"</p>

<p>	"Gray face,
pockmarks, stocky medium build, fancy purple vest and watch chain.
Like he stepped out of the 1890s. Didn't seem to feel the heat."</p>

<p>	"Anything else?"</p>

<p>	"Funny smell
about him, like something rotten in a refrigerator."</p>

<p>	"Please describe
the ritual you witnessed," I said.</p>

<p>	"Allow me,"
interrupted Dimitri. He looked at the boy and said, "Ganymede"
and snapped his fingers. The boy shivered and closed his eyes,
breathing deeply. When he spoke, his voice was altered beyond
recognition. I had the impression he was translating the words from
another tongue, a language of giggles and turkey gobbles and coos and
purrs and whimpers and trills.</p>

<p>	"Ganymede
Hotel ... shutters closed ... naked on the bed ... Jerry's picture
... it's coming alive ... gets me hot to look at it ... I know he's
in a room just like this ... waiting ... there's a smell in the room,
<emphasis>his</emphasis> smell ... I can smell what's going to happen ... naked
with animal masks ... demon masks ... I'm naked but I don't have a
mask. We are standing on a stage ... translucent noose ... it's
squirming like a snake ... Jerry is led in naked by a twin sister ...
can't hardly tell them apart. There's a red haze over everything, and
the <emphasis>smell</emphasis>—" The kid whimpered and squirmed and
rubbed his crotch. "She's tying his hands behind him with a red
scarf ... she's got the noose around his neck ... It's <emphasis>growing</emphasis>
into him ... his cock is coming up and he gets red all over right
down to his toenails—we call it a red-on...." Adam
giggled. "The platform falls out from under him and he's hanging
there kicking. He goes off three times in a row. His twin sister is
catching the seed in a bottle. It's going to <emphasis>grow</emphasis>...."
The boy opened his eyes and looked uncertainly at Dimitri, who shook
his head in mild reproof.</p>

<p>	"You still think
all this happened, Adam?"</p>

<p>	"Well, sure,
Doctor, I remember it."</p>

<p>	"You remember
dreams too. Your story has been checked and found to be without
factual foundation. This was hardly necessary since you have been
under constant surveillance since your arrival in Athens. The heroin
you were taking has been analyzed. It contains certain impurities
which can cause a temporary psychosis with just such bizarre
hallucinations as you describe. We were looking for the wholesalers
who were distributing this poisonous heroin. We have them now. The
case is closed. I advise you to forget all about it. You will be
released tomorrow. The consulate has arranged for you to work your
way home on a freighter."</p>

<p>	The boy was led away
by a white-coated attendant.</p>

<p>	"What about the
other witnesses, who wore masks?" I asked Dimitri.</p>

<p>	"I
surmised that they would be eligible for immediate disposal. A
charter plane for London leaving Athens the day after the ritual
murder crashed in Yugoslavia. There were no survivors. I checked the
passenger list with my police contacts in England. Seven of the
passengers belonged to a Druid cult suspected of robbing graves and
performing black-magic rituals with animal sacrifices. One of the
animals allegedly sacrificed was a horse. Such an act is considerably
more shocking to the British sensibility than human
sacrifice."</p><empty-line /><p>	"They sacrificed a <emphasis>horse</emphasis>?"</p>

<p>	"It's an old
Scythian practice. A naked youth mounts the horse, slits its throat
and rides it to the ground. Dangerous, I'm told. Rather like your
American rodeos."</p>

<p>	"What about the
twin sister who hanged him?" Jim demanded.</p>

<p>	Dimitri opened a file.
"'She' is a transvestite, Arn West, born Arnold Atkins at
Newcastle upon Tyne. A topflight ultra-expensive assassin
specializing in sexual techniques and poisons. His consultation fee
to listen to a proposition is a hundred thousand dollars,
nonrefundable. Known as the Popper, the Blue Octopus, the Siren
Cloak.</p>

<p>	"And now, would
you gentlemen care to join me for dinner? I would like to hear from
you, Mr. Snide, the complete story and a version edited for the so
limited police mentality."</p><empty-line /><p>Dimitri's house was
near the American embassy. It was not the sort of house you would
expect a police official on a modest salary to own. It took up almost
half a block. The grounds were surrounded by high walls, with six
feet of barbed wire on top. The door looked like a bank vault.</p>

<p>	Dimitri led the way
down a hall with red-tiled floor into a book-lined room. French doors
opened onto a patio about seventy feet long and forty feet wide. I
could see a pool, trees and flowers. Jim and I sat down and Dimitri
mixed drinks. I glanced at the books: magic, demonology, a number of
medical books, a shelf of Egyptology and books on the Mayans and
Aztecs.</p>

<p>	I told Dimitri what I
knew and what I suspected. It took about half an hour. After I had
finished, he sat for some time in silence, looking down into his
drink.</p>

<p>	"Well, Mr.
Snide," he said at last. "It would seem that your case is
closed. The killers are dead."</p>

<p>	"But they were
only—"</p>

<p>	"Exactly:
Servants. Dupes. Hired killers, paid off with a special form of
death. You will recognize the rite as the Egyptian sunset rite
dedicated to Set. A sacrifice involving both sex and death is the
most potent projection of magical intention. The participants did not
know that one of the intentions they were projecting was their own
death in a plane crash."</p>

<p>	"Any evidence of
sabotage?"</p>

<p>	"No. But there
was not much left of the plane. The crash occurred outside Zagreb.
Pilot was off course and flying low. It looks like pilot error. There
are, of course, techniques for producing such errors.... You are
still intending to continue on this case? To find the higher-ups? And
why exactly?"</p>

<p>	"Look, Colonel,
this didn't start with the Green case. These people are old enemies."</p>

<p>	"Do not be in a
hurry to dispose of old enemies. What would you do without them? Look
at it this way: You are retained to find a killer. You turn up a
hired assassin. You are not satisfied. You want to find the man who
hired him. You find another servant. You are not satisfied. You find
another servant, and another, right up to Mr. or Mrs. Big—who
turns out to be yet another servant ... a servant of forces and
powers you cannot reach. Where do you stop? Where do you draw the
line?"</p>

<p>	He had a point.</p>

<p>	He
went on: "Let us consider what has happened here. A boy has been
hanged for ritual and magical purposes. Is this so startling? ... You
have read <emphasis>The Bog People</emphasis>?"</p>

<p>	I nodded.</p>

<p>	"Well, a modest
consumption of one nude hanging a year during the spring festivals
... such festivals, within reason, could serve as a safety valve....
After all, worse things happen every day. Certainly this is a minor
matter compared with Hiroshima, Vietnam, mass pollution, droughts,
famines ... you have to take a broad general view of things."</p>

<p>	"It might not be
within reason at all. It might become pandemic."</p>

<p>	"Yes ... the
Aztecs got rather out of hand. But you are referring to your virus
theory. Shall we call it 'Virus B-23'? The 'Hanging Fever'? And you
are extrapolating from two cases which may not be connected. Peter
Winkler may have died from something altogether different. I know you
do not want to entertain such a possibility, but suppose that such an
epidemic does occur?" He paused. "How old was Winkler?"</p>

<p>	"In his early
fifties."</p>

<p>	"So. Jerry was a
carrier of the illness. He did not die of it directly. Winkler, who
was thirty years older, died in a few days. Well ... there are those
who think a selective pestilence is the most humane solution to
overpopulation and the attendant impasses of pollution, inflation,
and exhaustion of natural resources. A plague that kills the old and
leaves the young, minus a reasonable percentage ... one might be
tempted to let such an epidemic run its course even if one had the
power to stop it."</p>

<p>	"Colonel I have a
hunch that what we might find in the South American laboratories
would make the story we heard from Adam North sound like a mild
Gothic romance for old ladies and children."</p>

<p>	"Exactly what I
am getting at, Mr. Snide. There are risks not worth taking. There are
things better left unseen and unknown."</p>

<p>	"But somebody has
to see and know them eventually. Otherwise there is no protection."</p>

<p>	"That somebody
who has to see and know may not be you. Think of your own life, and
that of your assistant. You may not be called upon to act in this
matter."</p>

<p>	"You have a
point."</p>

<p>	"He sure does,"
said Jim.</p>

<p>	"Mr. Snide, do
you consider Hiroshima a crime?"</p>

<p>	"Yes."</p>

<p>	"Were you ever
tempted to go after the higher-ups?"</p>

<p>	"No. It wasn't my
business."</p>

<p>	"The same
considerations may apply here. There is, however, one thing you can
do: find the head and exorcise it. I have already done this with the
body. Mr. Green agreed to burial here in the American cemetery."</p>

<p>	He walked across the
room to a locked cabinet and returned with an amulet: runic lettering
on what looked like parchment in an iron locket. "Not
parchment—human skin ..." he told me. "The ceremony
is quite simple: the head is placed in a magic circle on which you
have marked the cardinal points. You repeat three times: 'Back to
water. Back to fire. Back to air. Back to earth.' You then touch the
crown of the head, the forehead, and the spot behind the right ear,
in this case—he was left-handed—with the amulet."</p><empty-line /><p>	There
was a knock at the door, and a middle-aged Greek woman with a
mustache wheeled in the dinner of red mullet and Greek salad. After
dinner and brandy we got up to take our leave.</p>

<p>	"I
have said you may not be called upon to act. On the other hand, you

help. I can give you a contact in Mexico City ... 18

<p>	"Got
it," said Jim.</p>

<p>	"My driver will
take you back to the Hilton."</p><empty-line /><p>"Nightcap?"</p>

<p>	"No," Jim
said. "I've got a headache. I'm going up to the room."</p>

<p>	"I'll check the
bar. See you very shortly." I had seen someone I knew from the
American Embassy. Probably CIA. I could feel that he wanted to talk
to me.</p>

<p>	He looked up when I
walked in, nodded and asked me to join him. He was young, thin,
sandy-haired, glasses ... refined and rather academic-looking. He
signaled the waiter and I ordered a beer.</p>

<p>	After the waiter had
brought the beer and gone back to the bar, the man leaned forward,
speaking in a low precise voice.</p>

<p>	"Shocking thing
about the Green boy," He tried to look concerned and sympathetic
but his eyes were cold and probing. I would have to be very careful
not to tell him anything he didn't already know.</p>

<p>	"Yes, isn't it."</p>

<p>	"I understood it
was uh well, a sex murder." He looked about as embarrassed and
salacious as a shark. He was cold and fishy like the Countess de
Gulpa. I remembered that he was rich.</p>

<p>	"Something like
that."</p>

<p>	"It must have
been terrible for the family. You didn't tell them the truth?"</p>

<p>	<emphasis>Watch
yourself, Clem</emphasis>.... "I'm not sure I know the truth. The story
I actually told them is of course a confidential matter...."</p>

<p>	"Of
course. Profession ethics." Without a trace of overt irony, he
managed to convey a vast icy contempt for me and my profession. I
just nodded. He went on. "Strange
chap, Dimitri."</p>

<p>	"He
seems very efficient."</p>

<p>	"Very. It doesn't
always pay to be too efficient."</p>

<p>	"The Chinese say
it is well to make a mistake now and then."</p>

<p>	"Did you know
that Dimitri has resigned?"</p>

<p>	"He didn't say
so...."</p>

<p>	"He was the
object of professional jealousy. Career men resent someone with
independent means who doesn't really need the job. I should know."
He smiled ruefully, trying to look boyish.</p>

<p>	"Well, perhaps
you can avoid the error of overefficiency."</p>

<p>	He let that roll of
him. "I suppose these hippies go in for all sorts of strange
far-out sex cults...."</p>

<p>	"I have found
their se practices to be on the whole rather boringly ordinary...."</p>

<p>	"You've
read <emphasis>Future Shock</emphasis>, haven't you?"</p>

<p>	"Skipped through
it."</p>

<p>	"It's worth look
at carefully."</p>

<p>	"I
found <emphasis>The Biological Time Bomb</emphasis> more interesting."</p>

<p>	He ignored this .
"Dimitri's dabbling in magic hasn't done him any good either ...
career-wise, I mean."</p>

<p>	I could tell he knew I
had just been to Dimitri's house for dinner. He was hoping I would
tell him something about the house: books, decorations.... Which
meant he had never been there. A slight spasm of exasperation passed
over his face like a seismic tremor. His face went dead and smooth as
a mask, and he said slowly: "Isn't your assistant awfully young
for the kind of work you're doing?"</p>

<p>	"Aren't you a bit
young for the kind of work you're doing?"</p>

<p>	He decided to laugh.
"Well, youth at the helm. Have another beer?"</p>

<p>	"No thanks. Got
an early plane to catch." I stood up. "Well, good night,
Skipper."</p>

<p>	He decided not to
laugh. He just nodded silently. As I walked out of the bar I knew
that he deliberately was not looking after me.</p>

<p>	No doubt about it. I
had been warned in no uncertain terms to lay off and stay out, and I
didn't like it—especially coming at a time when I had about
decided to lay off and stay out. And I didn't like having Jim
threatened by a snot-nosed CIA punk. The Mafia couldn't have been
much cruder.</p>

<p>	"Your
assistant very young man. You looka the book called <emphasis>Future Shock</emphasis>
maybe?"</p>

<p>	When I got to the room
I found the door open. As I stepped in I caught a whiff of the fever
smell—the rank animal smell of Jerry's naked headless body. Jim
was lying on the bed covered by a sheet up to his waist. As I looked
at him I felt a prickling up the back of my neck. I was looking at
Jerry's face, which wore a wolfish grin, his eyes sputtering green
fire.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>Port Roger</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>Page from Strobe's
notebook:</p>

<p>	The essence of sleight
of hand is distraction and misdirection. If someone can be convinced
that he has, through his own perspicacity, divined your hidden
purposes, he will not look further.</p>

<p>	How much does he know
or suspect? He knows that the capture was prearranged. He surmises an
alliance between the pirates and the Pembertons, involving trade in
the western hemisphere, the planting of opium in Mexico, and the
cultivation of other crops and products now imported from the Near
and Far East. He suspects, or soon will, that this alliance may
extend to political and military revolution, and secession from
England and Spain.</p>

<p>	What
does he this is expected from him? The role of gunsmith and inventor,
which is partially true. I must not underestimate him. He has already
quite literally seen through Mr. Thomas. How long before he will see
through the others? <emphasis>Must be careful of Kelley</emphasis>. The most
necessary servants are always the most dangerous. He is a cunning and

Does he have any inkling what reason? He must be kept very busy as a
gunsmith lest he realize his primary role.</p>

Roger on the coast of Panama. This was formerly Fort Pheasant and had
been used as a base by English pirates sixty years ago. The coast
here is highly dangerous for the navigation of large vessels, owing
to shallows and reefs. Port Roger is one of the few deepwater
harbors. It is, however, so difficult to reach that only a navigator
with exact knowledge of the passage can hope to do so.</p>

<p>	The coastline is a
distant green smudge on our starboard side. Strobe and Thomas scan
the skyline with telescopes.</p>

<p>	"<emphasis>Guarda
costa</emphasis>..." the boys mutter uneasily.</p>

<p>	Capture
by the Spanish means torture or, at best, slavery. If overtaken by a
Spanish ship we will abandon ship in the lifeboats, leaving <emphasis>The
Great White</emphasis> to the Spanish. The boarding party will receive a
surprise, for I have arranged a device which will explode the entire
cargo of powder as soon as the doors to the hold are opened.</p>

<p>	Now the ship rounds
and heads towards land. Strobe, stripped to the waist, has taken the
wheel, his thin body infused with alertness. Two boys are taking
soundings on both sides, and the escort ship is a hundred yards
beyond us. We are sailing through a narrow channel in a reef, Mr.
Thomas and Kelley calling out orders as the ship slips like a snake
through a strip of blue water. The coastline is ever clearer, trees
slowly appearing and low hills in a shimmer of heat. An inaudible
twang like a loosed bowstring as the ship glides into a deep blue
harbor a few hundred yards from the shore, where waves break on a
crescent of sand.</p>

<p>	We
drop anchor a bare hundred yards from the beach, <emphasis>The Siren</emphasis> a
like distance behind us. From the harbor the town is difficult to
discern, being sheltered by a thick growth of bamboo and set among
trees and vines. I had the curious impression of looking at a
painting in a gold frame: the two ships riding at anchor in the still
blue harbor, a cool morning breeze, and written on the bottom of the
frame: "Port Roger—April 1, 1702."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>The Oarsmen</p>

<p>Thin copper-red bodies
leaning against the oars as boats glide forward in a silver spray of
surf and flying fish against a background of beach and palm trees.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>Unloading the Cargo</p>

<p>Bright red gums, sharp
white teeth, buttocks exposed as the cargo is passed over the side
with much singing and laughter. The boys make up songs about the
cargo as it is passed along to the rafts and relayed to the beach.
These songs, translated by Kelley, who has sidled up to me in his
pushy ghost way, seem flatly idiotic.</p>

<p>	The boys are unloading
powder kegs. We offer to help but the Indians sing. "White man's
hands slippery like rotten bananas." Now they pass up the powder
kegs.... "This go boom boom up question's ass."</p>

<p>	I ask Kelley what is
this "question"?</p>

<p>	"Short for
Inquisition."</p>

<p>	Boy
holds up keg of opium.... "Spanish no get this, shit come in
pants, very dirty <emphasis>muy sucio</emphasis>."</p>

<p>	"And
Kiki is getting a hard-on because he knows I look at his asshole when
he bends over for <emphasis>opio</emphasis>."</p>

<p>	"I was thinking
of Maria."</p>

<p>	"Take off the
cloth and show us Maria."</p>

<p>	Kiki blushes, but he
must obey the rules of this game. He takes off his loincloth, smiling
shyly to reveal lush purple-pink genitals, nuts tight, cock straining
up, the flower smell of it fills the hold.</p>

<p>	"Maria his
asshole. I fuck him her spurt six feet...." He looks around,
challenging the boys who sit on the opium kegs.</p>

<p>	Some of the boys
extract gold nuggets from little pouches at their belts cunningly
contrived from Spanish testicles.</p>

<p>	"He love this so
much I keep it in his nuts. Soon get rich like him."</p>

<p>	"That should be
easy for a bastard like you."</p>

<p>	"Put your yellow
shit where your mouth is, sister fucker. I see you do it with my own
eyes."</p>

<p>	An area is cleared and
carefully measured off and the bets placed. Kiki bends over, hands on
knees. The other boy, who looks like Kiki's twin brother, uncorks a
little-phallus-shaped vessel of pink coral, and a powerful odor fills
the hold, already heavy with the smells of opium, hashish, and salt
water drying on young bodies. The reek from the pink coral container
is a heavy sweet rotten musky smell like a perfumed corpse, or like
the smell you catch after lightning strikes.</p>

<p>	The unguent glistens
in the dim light of the hold, where red limbs stir lazily like fish
in black water. Now the boy rubs the glowing unguent up Kiki's ass
and Kiki writhes and bares his teeth as the other boy slides it in
and they both light up and glow—for a moment the hold is bright
as day with every face and body clearly outlined.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>Radiant Boys</p>

<p>"Bucking for
Radiant Bars," Kelley mutters sourly.</p>

<p>	"Radiant Bars?"
I ask.</p>

<p>	"Yeah. It's the
old army game from here to eternity. Now you may know Radiant Boys is
a special type ghost, when you see one you die soon after. Of course
you can get used to anything and bright boys is all in the day's work
to me. Now a good strong Radiant Boy can light up a room with a
twenty-foot ceiling. One of the best lived in an Irish castle and was
the ghost of a ten-year-old boy strangled by his insane mother. That
one killed three cabinet ministers and the vicar.</p>

<p>	"So
the dirty-trick boys get wind of this good thing and set up Project
RB to take care of key enemy personnel. They don't even know what
buttons to push. Project RB is dumped into the lap of us tech
sergeants. We get half-hanged, half-drowned, half-strangled, the
medics pawing us over.... 'How did it <emphasis>feel</emphasis>? Did you get
<emphasis>radiant</emphasis>?'</p>

<p>	"Put your shit
where the bys were. Radiant Boys is a special strike of death The
ghost lacks water. And a powerful odor filled the RB project.
Half-hanged half-bodies, the smell is pawing us over. Sweet rotten
musky smell like. Then some smart-pants-come-lately pulls the radiant
ass out from under you and makes shavetail out of it. Facts of like
in the army. Uncorks the old army game screwing tech sergeant like
me."</p>

<p>	Both his words and
manner of speech seemed at first unfamiliar to me, and yet somehow
they stirred memories—as an actor might be stirred by the
forgotten lines of some role he had played far away and long ago.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>Captain Nordenholz
Disembarks at Port Roger</p>

<p>There he is standing on
a ruined pier left over from the English in some uniform of his own
devising. He is flanked by Opium Jones, the de Fuentes twins and
Captain Strobe, all looking like a troupe of traveling players a bit
down on their luck but united in determination to play out their
assigned roles. Boys trail behind them, carrying an assortment of
bags, cases, and chests. They walk across the beach and disappear one
after another into a wall of leaves.</p>

<p>	I don't know what gave
me such an impression of shabbiness about this procession, since they
all must have chests of gold and precious stones, but for a moment
they appeared to my eyes as seedy players with grand roles but no
money to pay the rent. The jewels and the gold are false, the
curtains patched and shredded and torn, the theater long closed. I
was smitten by a feeling of sadness and desolation, as the words of
the Immortal Bard came to my mind:</p><empty-line /><p>There our actors,</p>

<p>As I foretold you, were
all spirits, and</p>

<p>Are melted into air....</p><empty-line /><p>We have landed. Captain
Strobe meets us on the beach emerging from a picture puzzle, his
shirt and pants splotched with green and brown, stirring slightly in
the afternoon breeze. We follow him as he walks towards a seemingly
unbroken line of undergrowth. He pushes aside branches to reveal a
winding path through a tangle of bamboo and thorn.</p>

<p>	We walk for perhaps a
quarter-mile as the path winds upward and ends in a screen of bamboo.
We are quite close before I realize that the bamboo trees are painted
on a green door that swings open like the magic door in a book I have
seen somewhere long ago. We step through into the town of Port Roger.</p>

<p>	We are standing in a
walled enclosure like a vast garden, with trees and flowers, paths
and pools. I can see buildings along the sides of the square, all
painted to blend with the surroundings so that the buildings seem but
a reflection of the trees and vines and flowers stirring in a slight
breeze that seems to shake the walls, the whole scene insubstantial
as a mirage.</p>

<p>	This first glimpse of
Port Roger occurred just as some hashish candy I had ingested on the
boat started to take effect, producing a hiatus in my mind and the
interruption of verbal thought, followed by a sharp jolt as if
something had entered my body. I caught a whiff of perfume and a
sound of distant flutes.</p><empty-line /><p>A long cool room with a
counter, behind which are three generations of Chinese. A smell of
spices and dried fish. An Indian youth, naked except for a leather
pouch that cups his genitals, is leaning forward on the counter
examining a flintlock rifle, his smooth red buttocks protruding. He
turns and smiles at us, showing white teeth and bright red gums. He
has a gardenia behind his ear and his body gives off a sweet flower
smell. Hammocks, blankets, machetes, cutlasses and flintlocks are on
the counter.</p>

<p>	Outside in the square,
Strobe introduces me to a man with a strong square face, light blue
eyes, and curly iron-gray hair. "This is Waring. He painted the
town."</p>

<p>	Waring gives me a
smile and a handshake. He makes no secret of his dislike for Captain
Strobe. Dislike is perhaps too strong a word since there is no hatred
involved on either side. They meet as emissaries of two countries
whose interests do no coincide at any point. I do not yet know what
countries they represent.</p>

<p>	Up to this moment I
have been so completely charmed by Strobe's nonchalance that I have
never stopped to ask myself: What is the source of his poise? Where
did he buy it, and what did he pay? I see now that Strobe is an
official and so is Waring, but they don't work for the same company.
Perhaps they are both actors who never appear onstage together, their
relationship limited to curt offstage nods.</p>

<p>	"I'll show you to
your digs," says Strobe.</p>

<p>	We go through a
massive studded door into a patio, cool and shady with trees,
flowering shrubs, and a pool. The patio is a miniature version of the
town square. My attention is immediately arrested by a youth who is
standing about thirty feet from the entrance executing a dance step,
one hand on his hip and the other above his head. He has his back
towards us and as we enter the courtyard he freezes in midstep,
turning his head to point towards us. At this moment, everyone in the
patio looks at us.</p>

<p>	The youth pivots and
advances to meet us. He is wearing a purple silk vest which is open
in front, and his arms are bare from the shoulders. His arms and
torso are dark brown, lean and powerful, and he moves with the grace
of a dancer. His complexion is dark, his hair black and kinky; one
eye is gray-green, the other brown. A long scar runs down the left
cheekbone to the chin. He makes a mock obeisance in front of Captain
Strobe, who acknowledges it with his cool enigmatic smile. Then the
youth turns to Bert Hansen: "Ah, the son of family ..." he
sniffs. "The smell of gold is always welcome."</p>

<p>	I notice that he can
be warm and friendly from one eye and at the same time cold and
mocking from the other. The effect is most disturbing. Bert Hansen,
not knowing how to respond, smiles uncomfortably, and his smile is
immediately mimicked by the youth with such precision that it seems
for a moment they have switched places.</p>

<p>	He ruffles the cabin
boy's hair. "An Irish leprechaun." To Paco he says
something in Portuguese. I recognize him as the regimental or
shipboard joker and Master of Ceremonies, and Paco tells me his name
is Juanito. I have no doubt that Juanito can, if necessary, back his
sharp tongue with knife or cutlass.</p>

<p>	Now it is my turn. I
extend my hand, but instead of shaking it he turns it over and
pretends to read the palm. "You are going to meet a handsome
stranger." He beckons over his shoulder and calls out: "Hans."
A boy who is standing by the pool throwing bits of bread to the fish
turns and walks towards me. Wearing only blue trousers, he is
shirtless and barefoot, with yellow hair and blue eyes. His tanned
torso is smooth and hairless.</p>

<p>	"Noah, the
gunsmith, meet Hans, the gunsmith."</p>

<p>	Hans brings his heels
together and bows from the waist as we shake hands. He invites me to
move into his room.</p>

<p>	The patio is
completely surrounded by a two-story wooden building. The
second-floor rooms open onto a porch which runs all around the upper
story and overhangs the ground floor. The rooms have no doors but at
the top of the entrance there is a roll of mosquito netting which is
lowered at twilight. The rooms are bare whitewashed cubicles with
hooks for slinging hammocks and in the walls wooden pegs for clothes.</p>

<p>	I take my gear to a
room on the second floor and Hans introduces me to an American boy
from Middletown who also shares the room. His name is Dink Rivers.
His extraordinarily clear and direct gray eyes convey a shock of
surprise and recognition as if we had known one another from
somewhere else, and for a second I am in a dry streambed and he says:
"If you still want me you'd better take me up soon." Next
second I am back in the room at Port Roger, and we are shaking hands
and he is saying:</p>

<p>	"Nice to see
you."</p>

<p>	When I inquire as to
his trade, he says that he is in physical education. Hans explains
that he is a student and instructor in body control.</p>

<p>	"He can stop his
pulse, jump from twenty feet, stay under water five minutes and"—Hans
grins—"go off no hands."</p>

<p>	When I asked the boy
to make a demonstration, he looked at me very earnestly without
smiling and said that he would so when the time came.</p>

<p>	There
are four latrines: two for the ground floor and two for the upper
floor, with toilets that can be flushed from a water tank which fills
with rainwater drained off the roof. The patio contains a number of
fig, orange, mango, and avocado trees and a menagerie of cats,
iguanas, monkeys, and strange gentle animals with long snouts. On the
ground floor there is a communal dining room, a kitchen, and a large
bath where hot water is drawn into buckets. This is an Arab-style
bath known as a <emphasis>haman</emphasis>.</p>

<p>	The
dancing boy are spreading mats under the portico, lighting their
hashish pipes and brewing the sweet mint tea they drink constantly.
Chinese youths are smoking opium. The entire crew of <emphasis>The Siren</emphasis>
is housed here, and it is a mixed company: English, Irish, American,
Dutch, German, Spanish, Arabs, Malay, Chinese, and Japanese. We
stroll about, talking and introducing ourselves among the murmur of
many tongues.</p>

<p>	Old acquaintances are
renewed and bonds of language and common places of origin discovered.
There are some boy from New York who had been river pirates, and it
turns out that they know Guy, Bill, and Adam. Five huge Nubians,
liberated by Nordenholz from a slave ship, speak a language known
only to themselves. Now word is passed along through Kelley and
Juanito the Joker that Nordenholz will entertain us all for dinner at
his house.</p>

<p>	Hans
looks at me with a knowing smile. <emphasis>"Fräuleins."</emphasis>
He punches his finger in and out of his fist. The word echoes through
the patio in many languages. Hans explains that there will be a
number of women at the party who have come for the purpose of
becoming impregnated.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>Mother is the best bet</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>At twilight we make our
way towards the house of Skipper Nordenholz, which is outside the
town on higher ground overlooking the bay. He receives us in a large
courtyard covered with lattice and mosquito netting. He has a thin
aristocratic face, green eyes, a continual ironic smile, and an
oblique way of talking and glancing down his nose at the same
time....</p>

<p>	"Most
glad to welcome you to Port Roger. Hope that your quarters are
convenient...." His English is almost perfect except for a
slight inflection. "And now"—he glances down his nose
and smiles as he gestures towards a table twenty feet long, laden
with food: fish, oysters, shrimp, turkey, venison, wild pig, heaping
bowls of rice, yams, corn, mangoes, oranges, and kegs of wine and
beer—"<emphasis>chacun pour soi</emphasis>."</p>

<p>	Everyone helps himself
as Skipper Nordenholz indicates the seating arrangements. I am to sit
at his table with Captain Strobe, the de Fuentes or Iguana twins as
they are called, Opium Jones, Bert Hansen, Clinch Todd, Hans, and
Kelley, and a Doctor Benway.</p>

<p>	I will attempts to
report as accurately as my memory permits the conversation at the
dinner table. It was all concerned with weaponry and tactics but on a
level I had never thought possible outside my lonely adolescent
literary endeavors—for I have always been a scribbler and
during the long shut-in winters filled notebook after notebook with
lurid tales involving pirates from other planets, copulations with
alien beings, and attacks of the Radiant Boys on the Citadel of the
Inquisition. These notebooks with illustrations by Bert Hansen are in
my possession, locked in a small chest. The conversation at the
dinner table gave me the feeling that my notebooks were coming alive.</p>

<p>	"For
the benefit of you <emphasis>Great White</emphasis> boys"—Skipper
Nordenholz looked down at the table and his eyes glinted with
irony—"I would like to say that our enemy in this area is
Spain, and our most powerful weapon is the freedom hopes of captive
peoples now enslaved and peonized under the Spanish. But this weapon
alone is not enough. First we must develop more efficient firearms
and artillery. For this task we are depending on our able gunsmiths.
We must also bear in mind that there are many different types of
weapons. Opium Jones, we would be interested to hear your report."</p>

<p>	Opium Jones got up and
pulled down a map about six feet square on a roller, speaking in his
dead opium voice.</p>

<p>	"As you know, we
have imported a quantity of poppy seed. We already have fields in
these areas. Many other areas are suitable for cultivation. We are
sending out opium advisers. Missionary work, we call it."</p>

<p>	"And what do you
see as the long-range effects of this brotherly project?" asked
Nordenholz.</p>

<p>	"In commercial
terms, we can undersell eastern opium and take over the opium trade
for the Americas, Canada, and the West Indies. Of course, we can
expect a percentage of addicts in the areas of cultivation...."</p>

<p>	What advantages and
disadvantages do addicts present from the military point of view?"</p>

<p>	"We can insure
loyalty by impounding the opium crop. Addicts are more tolerant than
non-addicts of cold, fatigue, and discomfort. They have a strong
resistance amounting to virtual immunity to rheums, coughs,
consumption, and other respiratory complaints. On the other hand,
they are incapacitated if the opium supply is cut off."</p>

<p>	"You also
distribute hashish?"</p>

<p>	"Certainly. A
measure of seed with any purchase at our trading posts. Unlike opium
it grows anywhere." Jones made a sweeping gesture. "The
whole area is full of it."</p>

<p>	Doctor Benway got up.</p>

<p>	"Sickness has
killed more soldiers than all the wars of history. We can turn
illness to account. If your enemy is sick and you are well, the
victory is yours. Healthy vultures can kill a sick lion. For example,
my learned colleague Opium Jones has pointed out the immunity of
addicts to respiratory afflictions. And I may add that periodic users
who need not become addicted are equally immune. Consider the
advantages conferred in an epidemic of the deadly Spanish influenza."</p>

<p>	"Is there any way
in which such an epidemic could be induced?"</p>

<p>	"There are no
problems. All respiratory complaints are transmitted by spitting,
sneezing, and coughing. We need only collect these exudations and
convey them into the enemy area. Consider other potential allies...."
He pointed to areas on the map. "Malaria and yellow fever ...
both imported from the Old World and flourishing in the New. My
researches have convinced me that these illnesses are conveyed by
mosquitoes. Mosquito netting, pine incense, oil of citronella rubbed
on exposed skin areas ... these simple precautions—not, of
course, infallible—will give us an advantage of fifty enemy
cases to one. Dysentery, jaundice, typhoid fever ... these even more
reliable allies are conveyed by the ingestion of infected excrement,
which can be collected and introduced into the enemy water supply.
Boiling all drinking water and abstaining from uncooked foods or
unpeeled fruits yields one-hundred-percent immunity. We must, of
course, always be careful not to encourage an illness for which we do
not have a remedy or means of avoidance."</p>

<p>	"Magical
weapons?"</p>

<p>	The Iguana girl spoke
in her cool remote voice: "All religions are magical systems
competing with other systems. The Church has driven magic into covens
where practitioners are bound to each other by a common fear. We can
unite the Americas into a vast coven of those who live under the
Articles, united against the Christian Church, Catholic and
Protestant. It is our policy to encourage the practice of magic and
to introduce alternative religious beliefs to break the Christian
monopoly. We will set up an alternative calendar with non-Christian
holidays. Christianity will then take its place as one of many
religions protected from persecution by the Articles."</p>

<p>	"Economic
weapons?"</p>

<p>	Strobe glanced through
some notes. "We can, of course, undersell Eastern opium...and no
doubt various other products such as tea, silk, and spices. But our
most powerful monopoly is sugar and rum. Europe will pay our price
for sugar."</p>

<p>	My appetite was
sharpened by hashish and I was the better able to savor the excellent
repast: clams and oysters baked on hot coals with a dry white wine,
wild turkey, pigeons, venison with a vintage Bordeaux, yams, corn,
squash, and beans, avocadoes, mangoes, oranges and coconuts.</p>

<p>	After the company had
eaten their fill, Skipper Nordenholz tapped a glass for silence. He
stood up in front of the map, speaking in a self-effacing manner with
pauses and unfinished sentences as he gestured from time to time to
the map with his long beautifully kept gambler's fingers.</p>

<p>	"For the benefit
of newcomers ... old hands may also profit ... a few indications and
guidelines. We have already established fortified settlements ... as
you see, practically unlimited. We need artisans, soldiers, sailors
and farmers to man the settlements already founded and to establish
new centers from the Bering Strait to the Cape. Breeding is
encouraged ... is in fact a duty, I hope not too unpleasant. We
expect that some of you will raise families. In any case, mothers and
children ... well cared for, you understand. We need families to
operate as intelligence agents in areas controlled by the enemy. We
solicit those of you who are skilled as cooks, hotel keepers, doctors
and pharmacists ... strategic occupations. One of our aims is to
addict the Spanish to opium, thereby making them dependent on
supplies which we can, at a crucial moment, cut off.... And now there
are some uh young ladies who have been waiting to meet you."</p>

<p>	He sprinkled some
powder onto a brazier and a dense cloud of smoke arose with a sound
of thunder. Skipper Nordenholz, Captain Strobe, Opium Jones, Doctor
Benway, and the Iguana twins disappeared.</p>

<p>	Now a wind sweeps
through the courtyard of Skipper Nordenholz's house at Port Roger,
extinguishing the candles. When they are relit, fifty girls and women
are standing along the south wall of the courtyard. The men and boys
range themselves along the north wall, facing the women.</p>

<p>	Juanito, the joker and
Master of Ceremonies, prances out to the middle of the courtyard and
holds up his hands for silence.</p>

<p>	"And
now we will separate <emphasis>los maridos</emphasis>, the husbands, from <emphasis>los
hombres conejos</emphasis>, the rabbit men, who fuck"—he does a
speed-up bump and grind—"and run"—he does a
pantomime of running, swinging his arms and pumping his legs. "All
rabbit men will move to the east wall."</p>

<p>	Hans grins and puts
his hands to the sides of his head making rabbit ears and trots to
the east wall followed by four German friends. A Berber boy with
yellow hair, blue eyes and pointed ears plays the flute as he walks
to the east wall. Jerry and the dancing boys hop along behind him
chewing carrots. Bert Hansen pulls a rabbit out of a hat, bows and
runs for the east wall to a chorus of boos from the women and
applause from the east-wall boys. I wriggle my ears and twitch my
nose and show my teeth and scamper for the east wall followed by
Brady, Paco, Clinch Todd, Guy and Adam.... It's a landslide for the
east wall.... Juanito looks around as if bewildered....</p>

<p>	"<emphasis>Esperan
esperan</emphasis>.... Wait wait...." He dances behind a screen and
pops out naked except for a rabbit mask. He looks at the women. His
ears quiver and point east....</p>

<p>	"<emphasis>Y
yo el más conejo de los conejos</emphasis> ... the rabbitest of the
rabbits." He screeches and leaps for the east wall in great
hops.</p>

<p>	He doffs his rabbit
mask and advances again to the center of the courtyard and places an
hourglass on a little table. He turns to the prospective husbands who
still stand by the north wall....</p>

<p>	"You have two
minutes to think."</p>

<p>	He goes back to stand
by the east wall. As the sand trickles I study these faces. If we are
the fish, they are the water in which we will swim. They will hide
us, provide us with weapons, guides, and information. They will carry
out missions of sabotage behind enemy lines. Some of them will run
inns catering to officials, priests, and generals. Others will become
doctors and druggists. They are skilled in the use of subtle drugs
and poisons. They will implement Benway's program of germ warfare. A
few last-minute rabbits as the sand runs out. Then wives and husbands
pair off and retire to private rooms.</p>

<p>	Juanito leaps up and
does a flamenco dance as we move back to the north wall facing the
women, of whom thirty remain. They present a wide variety of physical
types: blondes, redheads, Indian, Chinese, Negro, Portuguese,
Spanish, Malay, Japanese, and some mixed blood. Preparations are
under way. The dancing boys whisk away plates and lay down pallets.
Incense burners are lit, musical instruments appear, props and
costumes are laid out: goatskins of Boujeloud, skeleton suits, wings,
animal and god masks. Two hangman's nooses dangle from a beam, the
rope passing through two pulleys to facilitate suspension. I note
that the ropes are elastic, and the nooses covered in soft leather.</p>

<p>	Juanito announces:
"Rabbit men and rabbit women, prepare to meet your makers."
He leads the way into a locker room opening off the east wall. The
boys strip off their clothes, giggling and comparing erections, and
they dance out into the courtyard in a naked snake-line. The women
are also naked now. What follows is not an unconstrained orgy but
rather a series of theatrical performances.</p>

<p>	"Ladies and
gentlemen, we will now witness the mating of the God pan and Goddess
Aisha."</p>

<p>	A backdrop of Moroccan
hills with a full moon lit from behind by a lamp casting a golden
glow over our naked bodies as the music of Pan fills the courtyard.
Six dancing boys with whips put on goatskin leggings and caps and
dance opposite six girls clad in swirling robes of thin blue silk.
The faces of the boys are remote and impersonal, yet their bodies
quiver and shake as if possessed by wild spirits. The boys rip the
robes from Aisha, who tries to flee. They whip her buttocks and she
falls on all fours as they fuck her in a crescendo of drums and pipes
and a strange perfume fills the air.</p>

<p>	"And now we
present for your entertainment: Half-Hanged Kelley and Half-Hanged
Kate in the Gallows Fling."</p>

<p>	Backdrop of a leering
crowd. Kate has red hair down to her waist, blazing green eyes, and
the raw red hemp marks around her neck. The story is that she was
being hanged for witchcraft and other crimes against nature when the
officials and spectators were dispersed by banshee wails, whereupon
she was cut down and revived by leprechauns.</p>

<p>	Kate and Kelley take a
bow. A sandy-haired boy I have seen on the boat plays the bagpipes as
they go into a wild jig, her hair twisting around her like flames
from Hell, dancing under the waiting nooses which they adjust around
each other's necks with idiot grins. He squirms it into her, kicking
out spasms in the air, as they are hauled off the ground by smirking
hangmen. Now their eyes light up in the gallows flash and the two
bodies are encased in a blazing egg of blue-white light. They are
lowered to the mat and little boys covered with green paint revive
them. They stand up and take a bow.</p>

<p>	A backdrop of sea and
palm trees. Idiot Hawaiian music as Hans does a hula fuck with a
lithe Malay girls while his four friends, on their backs, legs in the
air, applaud with their feet. Now the palm trees, with boys inside
them, go into the hula. The effect is irresistibly comic and there is
much laughter. Finally all the actors, including the palm trees, take
a bow.</p>

<p>	Thirteen dancing boys
fuck to Gnaoua drums and clappers. Gnaoua music drives out evil
spirits who try to enter the womb. You can see the future child in a
rush of liquid gold as the spirit of Hassan i Sabbah, Master of the
Djinns, Master of the Assassins, guides the writhing bodies and rapt
empty faces riding the drums like a bucking horse of flame. All the
boys come at once as the wolfish face of Pan blazes in the young
faces like a shooting star.</p>

<p>	"The Rape of the
Valkyrie," announces Juanito.</p>

<p>	A Swedish girl with
long blonde hair is against a backdrop of Northern Lights. She is
riding a horse which suddenly collapses under her and two blond
youths with Viking helmets wriggle out, tying her hands with a gold
rope. One fucks her as the other caresses her nipples. The boys grin
at each other showing all their teeth.</p>

<p>	I am trying to figure
what sort of act I could put on that would have the necessary
concentration of purpose to make a child. Clinch Todd helps me out of
my quandary. His father was a veterinarian and he found that sperm
collected from a prize pig, horse, bull, dog, or cat could be
injected into the vagina resulting in a pregnancy for which the bride
must pay a handsome dowry. Furthermore, one milking could provide
enough sperm for many little happenings and he had jars of this much
stored in the icehouse. I made the rounds with him once for kicks.
There he is jacking-off prize pigs and squirting it into the
sow—impersonal as if he were trimming a hedge. He had the
touch: the animal was randy as soon as he got his hands on it. But he
got to using opium and his touch failed him. He was kicked in the
head and killed by a stallion.</p>

<p>	This is the answer.
Clinch lines up five girls of different racial stock—black,
Chinese, Malay, Indian, Berber—who will be indirectly
impregnated, thus sparing me contacts for which I have little
inclination. I will play the young Corn God with a corn headdress. A
boy from Yucatán with black skin, straight hair, and classical
Mayan features will stand in as Black Captain, one of the Mayan war
gods, and fuck me standing up, as Jerry, cast as Ganymede the
cupbearer, gathers the seed in an alabaster goblet.</p>

<p>	The girls will proceed
to the remote inland communes to await delivery. They will all
receive a handsome dowry should they wish to marry and the children
will be trained from childhood in the use of weapons and fitted to
take their part in the task of liberation.</p><empty-line /><p>Pages from the diary of
Hirondelle de Mer:</p>

<p>I am a sorceress and a
warrior. I do not relish being treated as a breeding animal. Would
this occur to Captain Nordenholz? No force, he says, has been
applied—but I am forced by my circumstances, cast up here with
a peso, and by my Indian blood which compels me to side with all
enemies of Spain. The child will be brought up a sorcerer or
sorceress.</p>

<p>	Now,
a short rundown on these shabby adventurers plotting to appropriate a
continent and remake it to their taste. They all <emphasis>puto</emphasis> queer
<emphasis>maricones</emphasis>. Look at that Juanito—e<emphasis>l más maricón
de los maricones</emphasis>. <emphasis>El más puto de los putos</emphasis>.
Nordenholz was selling his ass in Hamburg twenty years ago. Old
story: sea captain takes a liking to him, signs him on as fourth
mate.</p>

<p>	And Strobe with his
well-rehearsed Eton accent. Circus people. Mother and father were
aerialists and they did this high-wire hanging act with angel wings:
he takes off the noose, extends his wings, and goes into a dazzling
aerial act with his angel wife. It attracted a lot of attentions and
the Strobes were taken up by the best people but not for long. Soon
the lordliness of their manners, talking to royalty as if they were
being nice to the servants, rendered them absolutely insufferable.
Their American origins were discovered and they were sent to the
colonies, where they decided the angel act was too exotic for
American tastes and booked as the Singing Aerialists. Soon they added
other instruments, throwing them from one to another on tightropes—a
high-wire musical juggling act it was. Young John learned his poise
on the high wire and his swordsmanship as well. But show biz wasn't
for him, and he shipped out with Nordenholz.</p>

<p>	The
Iguana twins have some claim to aristocratic birth. They came from an
old landed family, impoverished and dispossessed. They were brought
up to act rich at all times—"act like you've got it and
you'll get it," Mother always said. You can't lay it on too
thick in Mexico. With preposterous forged titles and <emphasis>pistoleros</emphasis>
on credit they seized an estate in northern Mexico and hit a silver
vein.</p>

<p>	Nordeholz is a good
organizer. He saw at once that a single settlement would inevitably
be discovered and wiped out. His plan called for a series of
settlements, so that if one were taken they could retreat to another
fortified position while bands of thirty men or so cut supply lines,
contaminated the enemy water supply, conducted hit-and-run raids, and
eventually forced the enemy to fight on two fronts when they laid
siege to the next position. Sound strategy. With every victory, more
people flocked to the Articles.</p>

<p>	Suppose the Spanish
have been driven out or brought under the Articles? Suppose, too,
similar uprisings in North America and Canada have shattered English
and French rule. What now? Can this vast territory be held without
the usual machinery of government, ambassadors, standing army and
navy? They can only plan to hold the area by sorcery. This is a
sorcerers' revolution. I must find my part as a sorceress.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>Quién es?</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>We flew back with a
three-hour stopover at Orly. I had decided what I was going to do. I
was going to refund Mr. Green's retainer, minus travel expenses, and
tell him the actual killers were dead in a plane crash. The Greek
police consider the case closed. Nothing further I can do.</p>

<p>	Back in my New York
loft I called the Greens. "This is Clem Snide calling. I'd like
to speak to Mr. Green, please."</p>

<p>	A woman's voice
sounded guarded: "What is it in reference to, please?"</p>

<p>	"I am a private
investigator retained by Mr. Green."</p>

<p>"Well,
I'm afraid you can't speak to him. You see, Mr. and Mrs. Green are
dead."</p>

<p><emphasis>"Dead?"</emphasis></p>

<p>"Yes. They
were killed last night in a car crash. This is Mrs. Green's sister."
She sounded pretty cool about it.</p>

<p>"I'm
terribly sorry...." I was thinking about what Dimitri had said.
The "Adepts" who had hanged Jerry did not know what magical
intentions they were projecting. They did not know to whom they were
aspeak ... plane crash ... car crash ...</p>

<p>I
didn't want to think about the Green case anymore, but it stuck to me
like the fever smell. What had Dimitri called it? B-23, the Hanging
Fever.</p>

<p>
Death is enforced separation from the body. Orgasm
is identification with the body. So death in the moment of orgasm
literally <emphasis>embodies</emphasis> death. It would also yield an earth-bound
spirit—an incubus dedicated to reproducing that particular form
of death.</p>

<p>I
took a Nembutal and finally slept.</p><empty-line /><p><emphasis>Someone
was murdered in this room a long time ago. How long ago ... the empty
safe .. the bloody pipe threader? His partner must have done it. They
never caught him. Easy to disappear in those days, when a silver
dollar bought a good meal and piece of ass. Smell of dust and old
fear in the room. Someone is at the back door.</emphasis> Quién

<p><emphasis>	It's Marty come to
call ... gaslight now on the yellow pock-marked face, the cold gray
eyes, the brilliantined black hair, the coat with fur trimming at the
collar, the purple waistcoat beneath....</emphasis></p>

<p><emphasis>	"We had a hard
time finding you." His drunken driver there can hardly stand up.
"Wore himself out getting here, he did."</emphasis></p>

<p><emphasis>	"He made a few
stops along the way."</emphasis></p>

<p><emphasis>	"Come along to
the Metropole and have some bubbly. It's my treat."</emphasis></p>

<p>	Now Broadway's full of
guys who think they're mighty wise, just because they know a thing or
two</p>

<p>	<emphasis>"No,
thanks."</emphasis></p>

<p><emphasis>	"What do you
mean, no thanks? We had a long way to find you."</emphasis></p>

<p>	You can see them every
day, strolling up and down Broadway, boasting of the wonders they can
do</p>

<p>	<emphasis>"I'm
expecting someone from the Palace."</emphasis></p>

<p><emphasis>	"Your old pals
aren't good enough anymore? Is that it?"</emphasis></p>

<p><emphasis>	"I don't
remember we were exactly pals, Marty."</emphasis></p>

<p>	There are con men and
drifters, Murphy men and grifters, and they all hang around the
Metropole</p>

<p>	<emphasis>"Let
me in, Dalford. I've come a long way."</emphasis></p>

<p><emphasis>	"All right,
but ..."</emphasis></p>

<p>	But their names would
be mud, like a chump playing stud, if they lost that old ace down in
the hole</p>

<p>	<emphasis>"Nice
place you got here. Plenty of room. You could put the Metropole in
here if it came to that...." He is sitting on the bed now.</emphasis></p>

<p>	They'll tell you of
trip that they're going to take, from Florida up to the old North
Pole</p>

<p>	<emphasis>"Look,
Marty ..."</emphasis></p>

<p><emphasis>	I
wake up. Jim is covered with white foam. I can't wake him.</emphasis>
"Jamie! ... Jamie! ..." <emphasis>Cold white foam.</emphasis></p>

<p><emphasis>	I wake up. Jim is
standing with a pipe threader in his hand, looking towards the back
door.... "I thought someone was in the room."</emphasis></p><empty-line /><p>I got up and dressed
and went into the kitchen to make breakfast. It tasted disgusting.
The Everson questionnaire and picture had arrived, and I looked
through them as I drank coffee. The pictures were quite ordinary. The
Everson boy looked like the clean-cut American Boy. I wondered why he
had taken up such an esoteric subject as Mayan archeology.</p>

<p>	Jim came in and asked
if he could take the day off. He does that occasionally, has an
apartment of his own in the East Village. After he left, I sat down
and went carefully through the Everson case: the boy had been in
Mexico City doing some research in the library preparatory to a dig
in Yucatán. In his last letter he said he was leaving for
Progreso in a few days and would write from there.</p>

<p>	After two weeks, his
family was worried. They waited another week then called the U.S.
Embassy in Mexico City. A man checked his address, and the landlady
said he had packed and left almost three weeks ago. A police check of
hotel registration in Progreso turned up nothing. It had now been
about six weeks with no word.</p>

<p>	Several possibilities
had occurred to me: He may have gone on some alternate dig. Postal
service in rural Mexico is practically nonexistent. Probably there
was no more involved than two or three lost letters. I was inclined
to favor some such simply explanation. I had no special feelings
about this case and felt sure I could locate young Everson without
much difficulty. I decided to knock off and take in a porn flick.</p>

<p>	It was good, as porn
flicks go—beautiful kids on screen—but I couldn't
understand why they had so much trouble coming. And all the shots
were stylized. Every time a kid came all over a stomach or an ass, he
rubbed the jism around like tapioca.</p>

<p>	I left in the middle
of a protracted fuck, and walked down Third Avenue to the Tin Palace
for a drink.</p>

<p>	There was a hippie
with a ratty black beard at one end of the bar and I could smell
Marty on him—that cold gray smell of the time traveler. I'd
seen him around before. The name is Howard Benson. Small-time
publisher, pot and C and occasional O. Lives somewhere in the
neighborhood. He caught my eye, drank up and hurried out.</p>

<p>	I gave him a few
seconds' start and tailed him to a loft building on Greene Street. I
waited outside until his light went on, picked the front-door lock
and went in. I had an Identikit picture of Marty with me that Jim
drew. It looks like a photo. I was going to show it to this Howard
and say it was a picture of a murder suspect, and see what I could
surprise or bluff out of him.</p>

<p>	His
loft was on the third floor. I knocked loud and long. No answer. I
could feel somebody inside. <emphasis>"Police!"</emphasis> I shouted.
"Open the door or we'll break it down!" Still no answer.
Well, that would keep the neighbors out of the hall.</p>

<p>	It took me about two
minutes to get the door open. I walked in. There was somebody there,
all right. Howard Benson was lying on his face in a pool of blood.
The murder weapon was there too: a bloody pipe threader that had
smashed in the back of his head.</p>

<p>	I took a quick look
around. There was a filthy pile of bedding in one corner and a phone
beside it, some tools, dusty windows, a splintery floor. Benson was
lying in front of an old-fashioned safe which was open. A dead gray
smell hung in that loft like a fog. Marty was there.</p>

<p>	The whole scene was
like something out of the 1890s. I bent down and sniffed at the open
safe. Faint but unmistakable, the fever smell. I got a nail. It stuck
to the sides of the safe. The walls were magnetized. Jerry's head had
been in that safe.</p>

<p>	Quickly I drew a
circle around the safe, seeing the head as clearly as I could inside.
I repeated the words and touched the absent head three times with the
amulet that Dimitri had given me. A tingle ran up my arm.</p>

<p>	Half an hour later, I
was sitting in O'Brien's office. His boss, Captain Graywood, was also
there. Graywood was a tall blond man with thick glasses and a blank
expression.</p>

<p>	"You want the
whole story, then?"</p>

<p>	"That's the
general idea."</p>

<p>	I told them most of
it, what I knew about Marty, and showed them the picture. I told them
about Dimitri finding the body and about Adam North's story. Captain
Graywood never changed his expression. Once or twice O'Brien turned
into his brother, the priest. When I had finished he took a deep
breath.</p>

<p>	"Quite a story,
Clem. We've had cases like that ... and worse things too: torture,
castration ... cases that don't get into the papers or into the
courts."</p>

<p>	Captain Graywood said,
"So it is your theory that the head was brought here as a potent
magical object?"</p>

<p>	"Yes."</p>

<p>	"And you are
convinced that the head was in that safe?"</p>

<p>	"Yes."</p>

<p>	"And why do you
think the body was addressed to South America?"</p>

<p>	"I don't know the
answer to that."</p>

<p>	"Ecuador is
headhunter country, isn't it?"</p>

<p>	"Yes."</p>

<p>	"It is logical to
assume then that someone planned to reunite the head and the body in
South America."</p>

<p>	"I think so."</p>

<p>	"You haven't told
us everything."</p>

<p>	"I've
told you what I <emphasis>know</emphasis>."</p>

<p>	"This Marty ...
Dimitri's men never saw him?"</p>

<p>	"No."</p>

<p>	"But you could
see him?"</p>

<p>	"Yes."</p>

<p>	"We can't arrest
a ghost," said O'Brien.</p>

<p>	"Well, if he can
make himself solid enough to beat someone's brains out with a pipe
wrench, you might be able to.... Question of being there at the right
time."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>Even the cockroaches</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p><emphasis>Una

Kiki worked as a waiter, had "La Cucaracha" on the jukebox.
It's a basement restaurant, with a small bar and a few tables. It was
11:00 P.M. and the place was empty. I hadn't seen Kiki since I
interviewed him on the Green case. Looking very handsome in a worn
dinner jacket, he was leaning against the bar, talking to a bargirl.
She does a strip-tease act uptown on weekends which is a thing to
see.</p><empty-line /><p>Because old Pancho

Kiki, ordered a margarita, and sat down, and right on cue a cockroach
crawled across the table. When Kiki brought the margarita I pointed
to the cockroach and said, "He's getting his marijuana and
getting it steady."</p>

<p>	"<emphasis>Sí</emphasis>,"
said Kiki absently, and brushed the cockroach away with his towel.</p>

<p>	I
looked around and saw there was one other diner by the door. I hadn't
noticed him when I came in. He was sitting alone and reading a book
called <emphasis>Thin Air</emphasis> about a top-secret navy project to make a
battleship and all the sailors on it disappear. It was supposed to
confuse the enemy; however, all the test sailors went crazy. But CIA
men were made of sterner stuff and found it modern and convenient to
"go zero" as they call it in a tight spot.</p><empty-line /><p><emphasis>Porque

the wall were bullfight posters and <emphasis>The Death of Manolete</emphasis>. The
poisonous colors made me thing of arsenic green and the flaking green
paint in the WC. It's a big picture and must be worth a lot of money,
like a wooden Indian or <emphasis>Custer's Last Stand</emphasis>, which the
Anheuser-Busch Company used to give out to their customers. I
remember as an adolescent being excited by the green naked bodies
sprawled about ass-up, getting scalped by the Indians, and especially
a story about one man who played dead while he was being scalped and
so escaped.</p>

<p>	I drank the margaritas
and ordered a combination plate and went to the green room. When I
came back, "Thin Air" was gone. Kiki came and sat with me
and had a Carta Blanca. I told him Jerry was dead.</p><empty-line /><p>			La

philosophically and a face leered out, the face of a middle-aged man
with a cast in the right eye. This must be Kiki's macambo magic
master, I decided.</p>

<p>	"It was his
destiny," Kiki said. "Look at these." He spread some
postcards circa 1913 on the table. The photos showed soldiers hanged
from trees and telephone poles with their pants down around their
ankles. The pictures were taken from behind. "Pictures get him
very hot. He want me pull scarf tight around his neck when he come."
Kiki made a motion of pulling something around his neck.</p>

<p>	"Jerry's spirit
had got into my assistant. Only you can call him out."</p>

<p>	"Why me?'</p>

<p>	"Jerry's spirit
has to obey you because you fuck him the best."</p>

<p>	Kiki's
eyes narrowed with calculation and he drummed on the table with his
fingertips. I was thinking I could use an interpreter on this trip
... after all, expense account. My Spanish is half-assed and in any
case he could find out more than two nosy <emphasis>gringos</emphasis>.</p>

<p>	"Like to come
along with to Mexico and South America?"</p>

<p>	I named a figure. He
smiled and nodded. I wrote the address of my loft on a card and
handed it to him. "Be there at eleven in the morning. We make
magic."</p><empty-line /><p>When I got back to the
loft Jim was there, and I explained that we were going to perform
this ritual to get Jerry's spirit out.</p>

<p>	He nodded. "Yeah,
he's half in and half out and it hurts."</p><empty-line /><p>Next day Kiki showed up
with a bundle of herbs and a head of Elleggua in a hatbox. As he was
setting up his altar, lighting candles and anointing the head, I
explained that he would fuck Jim and evoke Jerry to bring Jerry all
the way in—and then I had good strong magic to exorcise the
spirit. Kiki watched with approval, one magic man to another, as I
set up the altar for the noon ritual and lit the incense. It was ten
minutes before noon.</p>

<p>	<emphasis>"Todos
nudos ahora."</emphasis></p>

<p>	Kiki was wearing red
shiny boxer shorts, and when he slipped them off he was half-hard.
Jim was stiff and lubricating. I drew a circle around our bodies. We
were facing south for the noon ritual and I had set up a red candle
for fire, which was Jerry's element. The amulet was on the altar and
there was a tube of KY by the unguent jar.</p>

<p>	"When
I say ahora, fuck
him."</p>

<p>	Kiki picked up the KY
and moved behind Jim, who leaned forward over the altar, hands braced
on knees. Kiki rubbed KY up Jim's ass and hitched his hand around
Jim's hips, contracting his body as his cock slid in. Jim gasped and
bared his teeth. His head and neck turned bright red and the
cartilage behind his right ear swelled into a pulsing knot.</p>

<p>	Holding the amulet, I
took a position on the other side of the altar. Jerry's face was in
front of me now, as the red color spread down Jim's chest and his
nipples pulsed erect. His stomach, crotch and thighs were bright red
now, and the rash spread down his calves to his toes and the fever
smell reeked out of him. His head twisted to the right as I touched
the amulet to the crown of his head, to the forehead between the
eyes, and to the cartilage behind both ears.</p>

<p>	"Back to earth.
Back to air. Back to fire. Back to water."</p>

<p>	For a split second
Jerry's face hung there, eyes blazing green light. A reek of decay
filled the room. Someone said "Shit" in a loud voice. We
carried Jim to a couch. Kiki got a wet towel and rubbed his chest,
face, and neck. He opened his eyes, sat up, and smiled. The decay
smell was gone. So was the fever smell.</p><empty-line /><p>At two o'clock O'Brien
called: "Well, I think we've found your head for you—or
what's left of it. Can't be sure until we check the dental work...."</p>

<p>	"Where did you
find it?"</p>

<p>	"At the airport.
Crate labeled MACHINE PARTS sent by air freight and addressed to a
broker in Lima, Peru, to be picked up by Juan Mateos. The crate was
being loaded onto the plane when the workmen accidentally dropped it
and it split open. It was airtight and strongly built ... it just
happened to fall right on a seam. They tell me the stink was enough
to knock a man down. One of puked all over the crate."</p>

<p>	"When did this
happen?"</p>

<p>	"At noon. We sent
along a duplicate crate and contacted the Lima police to tail anyone
who calls for it."</p>

<p>	"Was the crate
lined with magnetized iron?"</p>

<p>	"Yes. We
duplicated that too. The Lima police have two men planted in the
customs broker's to watch anyone who calls for other crates in case
he tries to check out the head crate in any way. A compass would tell
him it is magnetized. We've got a wax head inside, so even with X-ray
equipment ..."</p>

<p>	"Very good. You
seem to have thought of everything. But just one more point: an
object like that gives out very strong psychic vibrations that a
sensitive could pick up on.... You might tell them to watch
especially for an adolescent who comes for another crate and touches
of brushes up against the head crate."</p>

<p>	"That's already
been done. Captain Graywood told them to watch for an errand boy who
might brush against the crate, especially with his ass or crotch."</p>

<p>	O'Brien said this in a
matter-of-fact voice, as if it were routine procedure. Dimitri,
Graywood, and now O'Brien. Who the hell were these so-called cops?</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>Firecrackers</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>There
are about thirty boys staying in Skipper Nordenholz's "Palace,"
as we call it. The number fluctuates from day to day as people come
in from other settlements or set out on various missions. Mr. Thomas
has taken <emphasis>The Great White</emphasis> and sailed with a small crew. His
assignment is, as always, to recruit people with special skills.</p>

<p>	The boys cook in the
communal kitchen or on the patio. Here the Arab boys roast meat over
charcoal fires and bake bread in clay ovens. Food is plentiful. We
set traps for fish in the river and in the bay. A short walk into the
jungle and I can shoot wild turkey and grouse and occasionally a
deer. River fish can also be kept in the fishpond until needed.</p>

<p>	We are all up at dawn
for a breakfast of eggs, fruit, and bread. Then after a short rest
there is instruction in bare-hand fighting given by Japanese and
Chinese youths: the use of stick, chain, and staff, different styles
of swordsmanship, and knife fighting. An Indian Thuggee gives lessons
in the strangling cord. He belongs to a dissident magical brotherhood
known as the Secret Stranglers who have separated themselves from the
worship of Kali.</p>

<p>	I take particular
interest in archery since the bow can deliver more projectiles in
less time than the guns we are making. I have made a number of
crossbows to sell in the store so that the Indians will be able to
duplicate the design. These bows are not as heavy as the usual
crossbows and it is quite easy to pull and cock the bow by hand. I am
more interested in speed of fire than in armor-piercing strength.</p>

<p>	Dink Rivers excels at
the martial arts. After a few lessons he is able to equal his
instructors in proficiency. He explains once general body control is
mastered, any physical skill can be learned almost at once. He has
promised to show me the secrets of body control but says that the
time has not yet come. "I get my orders in dreams and whatever
happens in my dreams then has to happen when I wake up." Often
he does not sleep in the Palace and Hans tells me he has a hut about
half a mile down the coast.</p>

<p>	One night I dream I am
sitting with Dink when he looks at me and says, "I think you
should see this," pulling down his shorts to reveal his
half-erect phallus. I wake up in a state of great excitement and Dink
says that the time is approaching. In preparation I must abstain from
sex for three days.</p>

<p>	At the end of this
period, during which I had not seen him, be appeared in my room
during the siesta hour and led the way out through the gate and along
the path by the sea. We are quite close to the hut before I can see
it, built in clump of trees and shrubs, painted green and blending
with the surroundings. The house is built of parts salvaged from
grounded ships.</p>

<p>	Inside it is cool and
dark, smelling of pitch. The house consists of a single room
furnished like a ship's cabin, containing a chest, a rolled-up
pallet, and two low stools of driftwood. We take off our clothes,
hanging them on wooden pegs and he indicated that I am to sit
opposite him on one of the stools, our knees touching. He looks
silently into my eyes and I feel a tightness and weakness in the
chest.</p>

<p>	He is getting stiff
and so am I, the feeling of weakness now like death in the throat as
we both are fully erect. Silver spots boil in front of my eyes and I
have a feeling of squeezing into his nuts and cock as I lie on the
pallet and Dink fucks me.</p>

<p>	Afterwards we lie down
side by side. He is talking in his clear grave young voice. I have
rarely seen him smile and there is something very sad and remote
about him like a faint sign or signal from a distant star.</p>

<p>	"Middletown isn't
like the town where you came from. There are no Mrs. Nortons sniffing
around for the scent of whiskey and sin. We do not allow people like
her in Middletown. To an outsider, Middletown is just a pretty little
place, stone houses along a clear river. Nice friendly folk. But
strangers don't stay unless we can adjust them to our ways. For those
who must remain outside there is no land for sale and no work.</p>

<p>	"Middletown is
run by a magical brotherhood. You will hear about white and black
lodges, the right-hand path and the left-hand path. Believe me, there
is no such sharp line. However, the Middletown Brothers would not
allow themselves to be placed in a position where they would need to
use the usual methods of black magic. Once you achieve body control
you don't need that.</p>

<p>	"There is no
formal initiation into the Brotherhood. Initiation comes through
dream guides. At the age of fourteen, when I began to have dreams
that culminated in ejaculation, I decided to learn control of the
sexual energy. If I could achieve orgasm at will in the waking state,
I could do the same in dreams and control my dreams instead of being
controlled by them.</p>

<p>	"To accomplish
sexual control, I abstained from masturbation. In order to achieve
orgasm, it is simply necessary to relive a previous orgasm. So while
awake, I would endeavor to project myself into sexual dreams, which I
was now having several times a week. It was some months before I
acquired sufficient concentration to get results.</p>

<p>	"One day I was
lying naked on my bed, feeling a warm spring wind on my body and
watching leaf shadows dance on the wall. I ran through a sex dream
like reciting my ABCs when suddenly silver spots boiled in front of
my eyes and I experienced a feeling of weakness in the chest—the
dying feeling—and I am slipping into my self in the dream and
go off.</p>

<p>	"Having brought
sexual energy under control I now had the key to body control.
Errors, fumbles, and ineptitudes are caused by uncontrolled sexual
energy which then lays one open to any sort of psychic or physical
attack. I went on to bring speech under control, to be used when I
want it, not yammering in my ear at all times or twisting tunes and
jingles in my brain.</p>

<p>	"I used the same
method of projecting myself into a time when my mind seemed empty of
words. This I would do while walking in the woods or paddling on the
lake. Once again, I waited some time for results. One day as I was
paddling on the lake and about to put out fishlines, I felt the
weakness in my chest, silver spots appeared in front of my eyes with
a vertiginous sensation of being sucked into a vast empty space where
words do not exist."</p>

<p>*</p><empty-line /><p>My time is divided
between the library and the gun shop. The library is well stocked
with books on weapons, fortifications, shipbuilding, and navigation
and has also a large number of maps indicating the number of Spanish
troops stationed in different locations, the nature of fortification,
and the Spanish sea routes with approximate times when they are in
use.</p>

<p>	It often happens that
quite practical inventions are for some reason not developed. Here
are plans for a repeating gun with a number of barrels rotating by
means of a hand-turned crank. A repeating gun is one of my dreams but
first there is some basic improvement required in the gun itself.</p>

<p>	Hans and I, wearing
only shorts, are reading the same book, our knees touching. Here are
plans for a grenade—simply a metal sphere filled with powder
ignited by a fuse, and a mortar that shoots large grenades for a
considerable distance. I feel a sudden quickening of interest and a
prickling sensation in the back of my neck. Hans seems equally
affected. He is breathing through his teeth, eyes boring into the
paper as if he were studying an erotic drawing.</p>

<p>	We look at each other
and stand up, our shorts sticking out at the crotch. We strip our
shorts and Hans grins and brings his finger up in three jerks. I prop
the book against the wall on the far side of the desk and bend over a
chair. As Hans fucks me, the drawings seem to come alive belching red
fire and just as I go off, Chinese children set off a string of
firecrackers against the door and I see a huge firecracker blow the
library to atoms as a gob of sperm hits the book six feet away.</p>

<p>	We
sit down naked and Hans wipes his brow with one hand and says:
<emphasis>"Wheeeeoooo!"</emphasis></p>

<p><emphasis>	</emphasis>I
say: "<emphasis>Firecracker!</emphasis> That's the basic exploding weapon.
It's all here, but they didn't see how far it can be carried.
<emphasis>Firecrackers</emphasis> ... they can be of any size. Why not exploding
cannonballs? One such projectile could sink a galleon."</p><empty-line /><p>"Waring is
expecting us."</p>

<p>Dink leads the way up a
steep path. Waring's house is on top of a hill in grove of trees,
concealed by vines. He receives us most cordially in a cool room
furnished in the Moroccan style with a low table and settees. A tall
aloof black serves mint tea, and Waring passes around a hashish pipe.
Dink declines, since he never touches alcohol or any other drug.</p>

<p>	At a sign from Dink,
Waring gets up and leads us into his studio.</p>

<p>	"While there is
still light ..."</p>

<p>	His
paintings are unlike any I have ever seen, containing not one but
many scenes, figures, and landscapes that flicker in and out of the
canvas. I can see <emphasis>The Great White</emphasis>, Harbor Point, fleeting
faces, islands, flying fish, and Indians rowing across the bay.</p>

<p>	Back
in the sitting room candles have been lit, and there is a partridge
pie with flaky pastry and wild turkey <emphasis>tagine</emphasis> on a low table. I
do not remember much of what was said during dinner.</p>

<p>	At one point, Waring
looked at me quizzically and said: "What you are doing is
against the rules. Be careful you don't get caught."</p>

<p>	It was quite late when
we left. Back in the hut, Dink rolled out the pallet and I fell into
a deep sleep.</p>

<p>	In
a dream I see Dink standing over me with the most perfectly formed
erect phallus I have ever seen. Now he is fucking me with my legs up
and as I wake up ejaculating, I find that he <emphasis>is</emphasis> fucking me. I
can feel his face in mine and for a split second he disappears and I
hear his fourteen-year-old voice in my throat: "It's me! It's
me! It's me! I made it! I landed!"</p><empty-line /><p>We can hardly wait to
get back to the shop and set all hand to work. In a week, we have
several different devices ready for testing. I have made a number of
arrows, the heads of hollow iron filled with powder; grenades, with a
shaft to be launched from a flintlock rifle; several mortars; and a
projectile for a cannon, designed to explode on contact. The nose of
this projectile, which is not round but shaped like a short cylinder,
is of softer metal packed with flint chips and iron filings so that,
being violently depressed on contact with ship or rigging, it
explodes the powder charge. Inside, the cylinder is lined with Greek
fire—that is, pitch mixed with finely powdered metal, this
being separated from the powder charge by a layer of paper.</p>

<p>	The time is now ready
for testing, There is a stranded ship two hundred yards off the coast
a mile down from our station. We proceed to the testing site with our
bows and rifle grenades, mortars, and one cannon. Everyone is there:
Strobe, the Iguana twins, Nordenholz, even Waring.</p>

<p>	Ten arrows and ten
rifle grenades are dipped into the fire. Bow is drawn, the head
ignited from a torch, and the arrow launched, the same procedure
being followed with the rifle grenades, which are of course much
larger. The missiles streak towards the ship and in a few seconds are
exploding on the decks, in the rigging, and against the sides,
starting fires from one end of the boat to the other. Then mortars
are launched, and though some fall short or overshoot, those that
land cause great damage.</p>

<p>	Time now for the
cannon: a perfect hit with a ten-pound projectile at the waterline.
The explosion tears a gaping hole in the hull and wraps the boatside
in fire. There is no doubt as to the deadly effectiveness of these
weapons. We are congratulated by Nordenholz and Strobe and the Iguana
twins.</p>

<p>	Waring smiles and
says: "Nice toys. Nice noisy toys to scare the ghosts away."</p><empty-line /><p>The plans are sent
along by courier to the other settlements and we busy ourselves
bringing the fortifications of Port Roger up to date. The Indians are
offered good pay to work in our ever-expanding shop and are learning
how to make these devices.</p>

<p>	Soon we have a fair
stockpile of shells sufficient to pour a deadly fire into the bay
from both sides. We have mounted gun towers around the walls of the
town with cannon that can reach the bay or be lowered to fire
directly down on any forces laying siege to Port Roger.</p>

<p>	Nordenholz is
supervising the construction of special boats designed to operate
near the coasts. These are about fifty feet long, mounted on two
pontoons. They will draw only a few feet of water and can be used in
rivers and quickly launched or concealed. They will carry the
maneuverable cannons and a good stock of mortars and grenades. He
calls them Destroyers, since they have no other purpose. No
provisions need be carried, just guns and gun crews, and the
Destroyers will be so much faster than a galleon that they can easily
avoid the fixed cannons.</p>

<p>	I now turn my
attention to improving the flintlock. My dissatisfaction with this
weapon derives from an incident that occurred in a waterfront tavern
in Boston. This place was near our old gun shop, and we were
accustomed to take a beer there after work. One evening I was there
with Sean Brady when a man came in who had been dismissed by my
father for his drunken, lazy, quarrelsome habits and had stomped out,
vowing vengeance on all of us.</p>

<p>	There he stood at the
bar, weaving and glaring at us with bloodshot eyes, and let loose a
string of vile oaths and insults. Brady told him to mind his mouth or
lose his teeth, whereupon the man pulled a flintlock pistol from his
side pocket, leveled it at Brady's chest, and pulled the trigger. At
this precise second the bartended, who was standing behind the
ruffian and to one side, spat a stream of beer straight into the pan,
causing the weapon to misfire. We then beat the man unconscious and
threw him into the harbor and watched him sink.</p>

<p>	Of what use are
flintlock weapons with a driving rain behind you? And the length of
time taken to reload far exceeds the firing time. The weapon lacks
firing power—that is, the number of projectiles that can be
fired in a given length of time. So back to the library.</p>

<p>	I note that early
cannonballs were breech-loading, and feel once again the admonitory
prickling in the back of my neck. At that very moment a hand touches
the nape of my neck. It is the Iguana who has come in silently with
her twin. I look up at her.</p>

<p>	"It's there in my
head, but I can't quite get it out where I can see it."</p>

<p>	"Well, how did
you see the exploding cannonball?"</p>

<p>	Hans and I look at
each other and grin.</p><empty-line /><p>Waring has told me
about Hassan i Sabbah, the Old Man of the Mountain, who terrorized
the Moslem world for years with a few hundred assassins. I pointed
out that holding a single fortified position—as Hassan i Sabbah
did at Alamut—is no longer possible, owing to improved weapons
that I have already perfected and which will inevitably, in the
course of time, fall into the hands of our prospective enemies. We
need now a much wider area of occupation, Waring said cryptically:
"Well, that depends on what you are trying to do."</p><empty-line /><p>As I was returning from
the library this afternoon, a red-haired child of twelve or so popped
out of a doorway, aimed a small pistol at me and pulled the trigger.</p>

<p>	"<emphasis>Bang!</emphasis>
You're dead."</p>

<p>	I
had seen these toy pistols may times before and never concerned
myself to find out exactly how they functioned, just as I had seen
firecrackers without realizing the potentials of <emphasis>that</emphasis> toy. The
child was reloading.</p>

<p>	"Let me see
that," I demanded.</p>

<p>	The child handed me
his pistol, which had a flat hammer. The report resulted from the
hammer's striking a little blister of powder glued between two pieces
of paper. Suddenly I had the solution: firing device, charge, and
ball in one unit, to be inserted and extracted through the breech. I
bent down and the boy jumped up on my back, and I carried him into
the gun shop as he fired his pistol in the air.</p><empty-line /><p>We are working round
the clock on this design. Pallets are on the floor, and we take turns
sleeping. We are producing double-barreled guns in both rifle and
pistol form, for increased firepower.</p>

<p>	In
a week we have two rifles and two pistols, with a number of
cartridges ready for testing. The test is carried out in the gun
shop, since secrecy must be observed. A man-sized target is set up at
one hundred feet. "<emphasis>Pow Pow</emphasis>"—two bullets on
target.</p>

<p>	After the test I
present the red-headed boy, whose name is Chan, with a rifle and give
Strobe a pistol. At this Strobe is somewhat piqued. I retain the
remaining two weapons for my own use. Plans are immediately
dispatched by courier to all the settlements in these locations: on
the Pacific side of the isthmus of Panama opposite the Pearl Islands;
two settlements inland from Guayaquil in a heavily wooded and
mountainous area; and settlements above Panama City on both the
Atlantic and Pacific sides and in the mountainous interior.</p>

<p>	Production of the
weapons is now standardized and we have fifty Indians working under
our supervision. As soon as they learn how to assemble the guns, they
are sent back to their villages and jungles since decentralization is
a keynote of our strategy. Instead of one central factory, there are
a number of small shops that can turn out a few guns a day. We are
distributing guns through the store in Port Roger. Arming the native
population is another essential step. The cannon that protect Port
Roger are being converted to receive breech-loading shells.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>Necesita automóvil</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>I hadn't been in Mexico
City in fifteen years. Driving in from the airport I could hardly
recognize the place. As Dimitri said, a selective pestilence may be
the only solution. Otherwise, they will multiply their assholes into
the polluted seas.</p>

<p>	Kiki,
Jim, and I checked into a small hotel off Insurgentes, which was a
few blocks from John Everson's Mexico City address. Then we split up.
Jim and Kiki went to John Everson's address to see what they could
pick up from the landlady and the <emphasis>vecinos</emphasis>. I went to the
American Embassy, found the Protection Department, and sent in my
card. I saw the girl hand it to a man at a desk. He looked at the
card and looked at me. Then he did something else. I waited twenty
minutes.</p>

<p>	"Mr. Hill will
see you now."</p>

<p>	Mr. Hill didn't get up
or offer to shake hands. "Yes, Mr. uh ..." He glanced down
at the card. "...Snide. What can I do for you?"</p>

<p>	There is a breed of
State Department official who starts figuring out how he can get rid
of you without doing whatever it is you want done as soon as you walk
into his department. Clearly, Mr. Hill belonged to this breed.</p>

<p>	"It's about John
Everson. He disappeared in Mexico City about two months ago. His
father has retained me to locate him."</p>

<p>	"Well, we are not
a missing-person service. So far as we are concerned, the case is now
with the Mexican authorities. I suggest you contact them. A colonel,
uh ..."</p>

<p>	"Colonel
Figueres."</p>

<p>	"Yes, that is the
name, I believe."</p>

<p>	"Did John Everson
pick up his mail at the embassy?"</p>

<p>	"I uh don't think
... in any case, we don't encourage ..."</p>

<p>	"Yes, I know. You
are also not a post office. Would you mind calling the mail desk and
asking if there are any letters there addresses to John Everson?"</p>

<p>	"Really, Mr.
Snide ..."</p>

<p>	"Really, Mr.
Hill. I have been retained by an American citizen—rather well
connected, I may add, working on a U.S. government project—retained
to find an American citizen who is missing in your district. So far,
there is no evidence of foul play but it hasn't been ruled out."</p>

<p>	He was also the type
who backs down under pressure. He reached for the phone. "Could
you tell me if there are any letters for John Everson at the desk....
One letter?"</p>

<p>	I slid a power of
attorney across the desk which authorized me among other things to
pick up mail addressed to John Everson. He looked at it.</p>

<p>	"A Mr. uh Snide
will pick up the letter. He has authorization." He hung up.</p>

<p>	I stood up. "Thank
you, Mr. Hill." His nod was barely perceptible.</p>

<p>	On the way out of the
office I met that CIA punk from Athens. He pretended to be glad to
see me, and shook hands and asked where I was staying. I told him at
the Reforma. I could see he didn't believe me, which probably meant
he knew where I was staying. I was beginning to get a bad feeling
about the Everson case, like gathering vultures.</p>

<p>	I waited almost an
hour to see Colonel Figueres, but I knew he was really busy. He'd
been a major when I last saw him. He hadn't changed much. A little
heavier, but the same cold gray eyes and focused attention. When you
see him he gives his whole concentration to you. He shook hands
without smiling. I can't recall ever seeing him smile. He simply
doesn't give himself occasion to do so. I told him I had come about
the Everson boy's disappearance.</p>

<p>	He nodded. "I
thought you had, and I'm glad you are here. We haven't been able to
give enough time to it."</p>

<p>	"You think
something may have happened to him?"</p>

<p>	Figueres doesn't
shrug. He doesn't gesticulate. He just sits there with his eyes
focused on you and what is being discussed.</p>

<p>	"I don't know. We
have checked Progreso and all surrounding towns. We have checked
airports and buses. If he had gone off on another dig, he would be
that much easier to locate. A blond foreigner off the tourist routes
is very conspicuous. We have also checked all the tourist places.
Apparently he was a level-headed, serious young man ... no
indications of drug use or excessive drinking. Is there any history
of amnesia? Psychotic episodes?"</p>

<p>	"None that I know
of."</p>

<p>	Dead end.</p>

<p>	Back
at the hotel, Jim and Kiki had turned up very little from questioning
the landlady and neighbors. The landlady described Everson as a
serious polite young man ... <emphasis>un caballero</emphasis>. He entertained few
visitors and these were also serious students. There had been no
noise, no drinking, no girls.</p>

<p>	I sat down and opened
the letter. It was from his twin sister in Minneapolis. It read:</p><empty-line /><p><emphasis>Querido
Juanito</emphasis>,</p>

<p>	<emphasis>He</emphasis>
has visited me again. He says that before you receive this letter He
will have contacted you. He says you will then know what has to be
done.</p><empty-line /><p>Your Ever
Loving Sister,</p>

<p>Jane</p><empty-line /><p>At three o'clock, I
called Inspector Graywood in New York. "Clem Snide here."</p>

<p>	"Ah yes, Mr.
Snide, there have been some developments in Lima. A boy did come to
call for another crate and was seen to brush against the duplicate
head crate. He was followed to a bicycle rental and repair shop in
the Mercado Mayorista. Police searched the shop and found false
identity papers in the name of Juan Mateos. The proprietor has been
arrested and charged with possession of forged papers and with
conspiracy to conceal evidence of a murder. He is being detained in
isolation. He claims he did not know what was in the crate. He had
been offered a fairly large sum to pick up the crate after it had
cleared customs. The crate was to have been brought to his shop.
Someone would arrange to pick it up there, and he would be paid an
additional and larger sum. The customs agent who passed the crate has
also been arrested. He has confessed to accepting a bribe."</p>

<p>	"What about the
boy?"</p>

<p>	"There was no
reason to hold him in connection with this case. However, since he
has a record for petty theft and a history of epilepsy, he has been
placed in a rehabilitation center in Lima."</p>

<p>	"I wish I could
be on the scene."</p>

<p>	"So do I.
Otherwise, I doubt if any important arrests will be made. In a
country like that, people of wealth are virtually untouchable. People
like the Countess de Gulpa. for example...."</p>

<p>	"So you know
about her?"</p>

<p>	"Of course. The
description of the man who contacted the customs broker tallies
rather closely with your Identikit picture of Marty Blum. I have sent
a copy to the Lima police and informed them that he is also wanted in
connection with a murder here. Benson, it seems, was a pusher,
small-time ... a number of leads but no arrests as yet. Have you
found the Everson boy?"</p>

<p>	"Not yet and I
don't like the looks of it."</p>

<p>	"You think
something has happened to him?"</p>

<p>	"Perhaps."</p>

<p>	"I believe you
have a contact from Dimitri." I had said nothing about this
contact when I told my story in O'Brien's office. "Perhaps it is
time to use it."</p>

<p>	"I will."</p>

<p>	"Your presence in
South America would be most valuable. It so happens that client who
wishes to remain anonymous is prepared to retain you in this
connection. You will find thirty thousand dollars deposited to your
bank account in Lima."</p>

<p>	"Well, I haven't
finished this case yet."</p>

<p>	"Perhaps you can
bring the Everson case to a speedy conclusion." He rang off.</p>

<p>	It would seem that I
had been called upon to act. I got out a map and couldn't find the
Callejón de la Esperanza. There are small streets in Mexico
City you won't find on a map. I had a general idea as to where it was
and I wanted to walk around. I've cracked cases like this with
nothing to go on, just by getting out and walking around at random.
It works best in a strange town or in a town you haven't visited for
some time.</p>

<p>	We took a taxi to the
Alameda, then started off in a north-westerly direction. Once we got
off the main streets I saw that the place hadn't changed all that
much: the same narrow unpaved streets and squares, with booths
selling tacos, fried grasshoppers, and peppermint candy covered with
flies; the smell of pulque, urine, benzoin, chile, cooking oil, and
sewage; and the faces—bestial, evil, beautiful.</p>

<p>	A
boy in white cotton shirt and pants, hair straight, skin smoky black,
smelling faintly of vanilla and ozone. A boy with bright copper-red
skin, innocent and beautiful as some exotic animal, leans against a
wall eating an orange dusted with red pepper ... a <emphasis>maricón</emphasis>
slithers by with long arms and buck teeth, eyes glistening ... man
with a bestial Pan face reels out of a <emphasis>pulquería</emphasis> ... a
hunchback dwarf shoots us a venomous glance.</p>

<p>	I
was letting my legs guide me. Calle de los Desamparados, Street of
Displaced Persons ... a <emphasis>farmacia</emphasis> where an old junky was
waiting for his Rx. I got a whiff of phantom opium. Postcards in a
dusty shop window. Pancho Villa posing with scowling men...gun belts
and rifles. Three youths hanging from a makeshift scaffold, two with
their pants down to the ankles, the other naked. The picture had been
taken from behind—soldiers standing in front of them watching
and grinning. Photos taken about 1914. The naked boy looked
American—you can tell a blond even in black and white.</p>

<p>	My legs pulled me in,
Jim and Kiki following behind me. When I opened the door a bell
echoed through the shop. Inside, the shop was cool and dim with a
smell of incense. A man came through a curtain and stood behind the
counter. He was short and lightly built and absolutely bald, as if he
had never had hair on his head; the skin was a yellowish brown,
smooth as terra-cotta, the lips rather full, eyes jetblack, forehead
high and sloping back. There was a feeling of age about him, not that
he looked old but as he were a survivor of an ancient race—Oriental,
Mayan, Negroid—all of these, but something else I had never
seen in a human face. He was strangely familiar to me and then I
remembered where I had seen that face before. It was in the Mayan
collection of the British Museum, a terra-cotta head about three
inches in height. His lips moved into a slow smile and he spoke in
perfect English without accent or inflection, eerie and remote as if
coming from a great distance.</p>

<p>	"Good afternoon,
gentlemen."</p>

<p>	"Could I see that
postcard in the window?"</p>

<p>	"Certainly. That
is what you have come for."</p>

<p>	It occurred to me that
this must be Dimitri's contact, but this was not the address he had
given.</p>

<p>	"The
Callejón de la Esperanze? The Alley
of Hope was destroyed in the earthquake. It has not been rebuilt.
This way, gentlemen."</p>

<p>	He ushered us through
a heavy door behind the curtain. When the door closed, it shut out
all noise from the street. We were in a bare whitewashed room with
heavy oak furniture lit by a barred window that opened onto a patio.
He motioned us to chairs and got an envelope from a filing case and
handed me a picture. It was an eight-by-ten replica of the postcard
in the window. As I touched the picture, I got a whiff of the fever
smell.</p>

<p>	Three youths were
hanging from a pole supported by tripods, arms strapped to their
sides by leather belts. There were two overturned sawhorses and a
plank on the ground below them. The blond boy was in the middle, two
dark youths hanging on each side of him. The other two had their
pants down to their ankles. The blond boy was completely naked. Five
soldiers stood in front of a barn looking up at the hanged men. One
of the soldiers was very young, sixteen or seventeen, with down on
his chin and upper lip. He was looking up with his mouth open, his
pants sticking out at the fly.</p>

<p>	The proprietor handed
me a magnifying glass. The hanged boys quivered and writhed, necks
straining against the ropes, buttocks contracting. Standing to one
side, face in shadow, was the officer. I studied this figure through
the glass. Something familiar ... Oh yes—the Dragon Lady from
"Terry and the Pirates." It was a woman. And she bore a
slight resemblance to young Everson.</p>

<p>	I pointed to the blond
boy. "Do you have a picture of his face?"</p>

<p>	He laid a picture on
the table. The picture showed the boy's face and torso, his arms
strapped to his sides. He was looking at something in front of him
with a slack look on his face, as if he had just received an
overwhelming shock and understood it completely. It was John Everson,
or a close enough resemblance to be his twin brother.</p>

<p>	I showed him a
snapshot of Everson I had in my pocket. He looked at it and nodded.
"Yes it seems to be the same young man."</p>

<p>	"Do you know who
these people were?"</p>

<p>	"Yes. The three
boys were revolutionaries. The blond boy was the son of an American
miner and a Spanish mother. He was born and raised in Durango and
spoke no English. He was hanged on his twenty-third birthday:
September 24, 1914. The woman officer was his half-sister, three
years older. She was finally ambushed and killed by Pancho Villa's
men. I can assure you that young Everson is alive and well. He has
simply forgotten his American identity. His memory can be restored.
Unlike Jerry Green, he fell into comparatively good hands. You will
meet them tonight ... Lola La Chata is holding her annual party."</p>

<p>	"Lola? Is she
still operating?"</p>

<p>	"She has her
little time concession. You will be back in the days of Allende. The
Iguana twins will be there. They will take you to Everson. And now
..." He showed us out the back way onto an unpaved street. "I
think you will get a ride to Lola's."</p>

<p>	Lola's was quite a
walk from where we were, and it was not an area for taxis. Also I was
a little confused as to directions. A Cadillac careened around the
corner and screamed to a stop in a cloud of dust. A man in glen plaid
suit leaned out of the front seat.</p>

<p>	"Going
to the party? Get in, <emphasis>cabrones</emphasis>!"</p>

<p>	We
got into the back seat. There were two <emphasis>machos</emphasis> in the front
seat and two on the jump seats. As we sped through the dirt streets
they blasted at cats and chickens with their 45s, missing with every
shot as the <emphasis>vecinos</emphasis> dove for cover.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>Por convención
Zapata</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>The
General's car stops in front of Lupita's place, which in a slum area
of unpaved streets, looks like an abandoned warehouse. The door is
opened by an old skull-faced <emphasis>pistolero</emphasis> with his black jacket
open, a tip-up 44 Smith &amp; Wesson strapped to his lean flank.</p>

<p>	The
<emphasis>pistolero</emphasis> steps aside and we walk into a vast room with a
high-beamed ceiling. The furniture is heavy black oak and red
brocade, suggesting a Mexican country estate. In the middle of the
room is a table with platters of tamales and tacos, beans, rice, and
guacamole, beer in tubs of ice, bottles of tequila, bowls of
marijuana and cigarette papers. The party is just starting and a few
guests stand by the table puffing marijuana and drinking beer. On a
smaller table syringes are laid out with glasses of water and
alcohol. Along one wall are curtained booths.</p>

<p>	Lola La Chata sits in
a massive oak chair facing the door, three hundred pounds cut from
the mountain rock of Mexico, her graciousness underlining her power.
She extends a massive arm: "Ah, Meester Snide ... El Puerco
Particular ... the Private Pig ..." She shakes with laughter.
"And your handsome young assistants ..." She shakes hands
with Jim and Kiki. "You do well by yourself, Meester Snide."</p>

<p>	And you, Lola.... You
are younger, if anything."</p>

<p>	She waves a hand to
the table. "Please serve yourselves.... I think an old friend of
yours is already here."</p>

<p>	I start towards the
table and recognize Bernabé Abogado.</p>

<p>	"Clem!"</p>

<p>	"Bernabé!"</p>

<p>	We got into an embrace
and I can feel the pearl-handled 45 under his glen plaid jacket. He
is drinking Old Parr scotch and there are four bottles on the table.
He pours scotch into glasses as I introduce Jim and Kiki.
"Practically everybody in Mexico drinks scotch." Then he
laughs and pounds me on the back. "Clem, meet the Iguanas ...
this very good friend."</p>

<p>	I shake hands with two
of the most beautiful young people I have ever seen. They both have
smooth greenish skin, black eyes, a reptilian grace. I can feel the
strength in the boy's hand. They are incredibly poised and detached,
their faces stamped with the same ancient lineage as the shop
proprietor. They are the Iguana twins.</p>

<p>	Junkies arrive and pay
court to Lupita. She rewards them with papers of heroin fished from
between her massive dugs. They are fixing at the table of syringes.</p>

<p>	"Tonight
everything is free," says the Iguana sister. <emphasis>"Mañana
es otra cosa."</emphasis></p>

<p><emphasis>	</emphasis>The
room is rapidly filling with whores and thieves, pimps and hustlers.
Uniformed cops get in line and Lupita rewards each of them with an
envelope. Plainclothesmen come in and shove to the head of the line.
Their envelopes are thicker.</p>

<p>	Bernabé
beckons to a young Indian policeman who has just received a thin
envelope. The policeman approaches shyly. Bernabé pounds him
on the back. "This <emphasis>cabrón</emphasis> get cockeyed <emphasis>borracho</emphasis>
and kill two people.... I get him out of jail."</p>

<p>	Other
guests are arriving: the glamorous upper crust and jet set from
costume parties. Some are in Mayan and Aztec dress. They bring
various animals: monkeys, ocelots, iguanas, and a parrot who screams
insults. The <emphasis>machos</emphasis> chase a terrified squealing peccary around
the room.</p>

<p>	A rustle of excitement
sweeps through the guests:</p>

<p>	"Here's Mr.
Coca-Cola."</p>

<p>	"He's the real
thing."</p>

<p>	Mr. Coca-Cola
circulates among the guests selling packets of cocaine. As the
cocaine takes effect the tempo of the party accelerates. The General
turns to a spider monkey perched on top of his chair.</p>

<p>	"Here,
<emphasis>cabrón</emphasis>, have a sniff." He holds up a thumbnail
with a pinch of cocaine. The monkey bites his hand, drawing blood.
The cocaine spills down his coat. "<emphasis>CHINGOA</emphasis> YOU SON OF A
WHORE!" The General leaps up and jerks out his 45, blasting at
the monkey from a distance of a few feet and missing with every shot
as the guests hit the deck, dodge behind chairs, and roll under the
table.</p>

<p>	Lupita
lifts a finger. Fifty feet away across the room, the old <emphasis>pistolero</emphasis>
draws his long-barreled 44, aims and fires in one smooth movement,
killing the monkey. The display of power intimidates even the <emphasis>machos</emphasis>
and there is a moment of silence as a servant removes the dead monkey
and wipes up the blood. A number of couples and some trios retire to
the curtained booths.</p>

<p>	Another
contingent of guests has arrived among whom I recognize American
narcotics agens. One of them is talking with a Mexican lawyer. "I
feel so sorry for these American boys in jail here for the <emphasis>cocaina</emphasis>,"
the lawyer says. "And for the girls, even sorrier. I do what I
can to get them out but it is most difficult. Our laws are very
strict. Much stricter than yours."</p>

<p>	In
a search booth, which is also one of the booths at Lupita's party, a
naked American girl with two uniformed police. The General and the
lawyer enter from a door at the rear of the booth. One of the cops
points to a packet of cocaine on a shelf. "She have it in her
pussee, <emphasis>señores</emphasis>." Ata  gesture from the General
the cops exit, grinning like monkeys.</p>

<p>	"We feel so sorry
for your pussee—frozen in the snow," says the General
taking off his pants. "I am the beeg thaw."</p>

<p>	A
giggling <emphasis>macho</emphasis> pulls aside a curtain in front of the booth.
"Good pussee, <emphasis>cabrones</emphasis>?"</p>

<p>	Two
Chapultepec blondes nudge each other and chant in unison: "Isn't
he <emphasis>marvelous</emphasis>? Never repeats himself."</p>

<p>	The
<emphasis>macho</emphasis> pulls aside the curtain of the next booth. "He fuck
her in the dry hole."</p>

<p>	"Never repeats
himself."</p>

<p>	In
the end booth Ah Pook, the Mayan God of Death, is fucking the young
Corn God. As the curtains are jerked aside they reach orgasm and the
young Corn God is spattered with black spots of decay. A nitrous haze
like vaporized fish steams off their bodies. The <emphasis>macho</emphasis> gasps,
coughs, and drops dead of a heart attack.</p>

<p>	"Never repeats
himself."</p>

<p>	Lupita gestures.
Indian servants load the body onto a stretcher and carry it out. The
party resumes at an even more hectic pace. The gas released by the
copulations of life and death acts on the younger guests like catnip.
They strip off their clothes, rolling around on mattresses which are
spread out on the floor by wooden-faced servants. They exchange masks
and do stripteases with scarves while others roll on their backs,
legs in the air, applauding with their feet.</p>

<p>	The Iguana touched my
arm. "Will you and your two helpers please come with me? We have
matters to discuss in private."</p>

<p>	She led us through a
side door and down a long corridor to an elevator. The elevator
opened onto a short hall at the end of which was another door. She
motioned us into a large loft apartment furnished in Moroccan and
Mexican style with rugs, low table, a few chairs, and couches. I
declined a drink but accepted a joint.</p>

<p>	"The postcard
vendor tells me you can help us locate John Everson," I began</p>

<p>	She nodded. I
remembered that I had not heard her brother say anything. He had
nodded and smiled when we were introduced. He sat beside her now on a
low couch looking serene rather than bored. Jim, Kiki, and I sat
opposite in three cedar chairs from Santa Fe.</p>

<p>	"We
have many places here...." A wave of her hand brought the
benzoin smell of New Mexico into the room. "It <emphasis>was</emphasis> a
lovely place but they had to spoil it with their idiotic bombs. Oh
yes, John Everson ... such a nice boy, modern and convenient. You
found him so, of course?" She turned to her brother, who smiled
and licked his lips. "Well, he is in Durango with relatives ...
in excellent condition, considering the transfer of identities. Such
operations may leave the patient a hospital case for months. This
generally means that the operations has not been skillfully
performed, or that discordant entities have been lodged in the same
body....</p>

<p>	"In Everson's
case, there have been no complications. We had to give the Mexican
identity sufficient time for a transfer to take place. Now it only
remains to blend the two and he will recover his own identity, with
fluent Spanish and a knowledge of rural Mexico which will be useful
in his profession.</p>

<p>	"In this case,
the two identities are so similar that there will be no disharmony.
And the spirit of El Gringo now has a home. He could not enter the
cycle of rebirth because his karma required a duplicate death. This
was done by electric brain stimulation which seems completely real to
the patient. As you know, a difficulty in organ transplants is that
they are rejected as a foreign body. Drugs must be administered to
suspend the rejection. In this case, the shared experience of being
hanged will dissolve the rejection that would otherwise occur, giving
rise to the phenomenon of multiple personalities, where only one
personality can occupy the body at one time. The hanging experience
acts as a solvent. The two personalities will blend into one. John
Everson will contact his parents, and tell them that he suffered a
lapse of memory owing to a light concussion but is now completely
recovered."</p>

<p>	I leaned back. "Well,
that wraps that case up."</p>

<p>	"You have been
retained to act against the Countess...thirty thousand dollars. Does
that seem enough to you?"</p>

<p>	"Well,
considering what we are expected to do—no."</p>

<p>	"And considering
that you are all inexperienced and susceptible, this is virtually a
suicide mission. I am prepared to retain you at a fair price and
provide contacts which will give you at least some chance of
success."</p>

<p>	She led the way into a
bare room with chairs, a long table, and filing cabinets along one
wall. I recognized the room as a replica of the room in back of the
postcard vendor's shop. She went to the filing cabinet and handed me
a short pamphlet bound in heavy parchment. On the cover in red
letters:</p><empty-line /><p>CITIES OF THE RED NIGHT</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>Book Two</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>Cities of the Red Night</p><empty-line /><p>The Cities of the Red
Night were six in number: Tamaghis, Ba'dan, Yass-Waddah, Waghdas,
Naufana, and Ghadis. These cities were located in an area roughly
corresponding to the Gobi Desert, a hundred thousand years ago. At
that thime the desert was dotted with large oases and traversed by a
river which emptied into the Caspian Sea.</p>

<p>	The largest of these
oases contained a lake ten miles long and five miles across, on the
shores of which the university town of Waghdas was founded. Pilgrims
came from all over the inhabited world to study in the academies of
Waghdas, where the arts and sciences reached peaks of attainment that
have never been equaled. Much of this ancient knowledge is now lost.</p>

<p>	The towns of Ba'dan
and Yass-Waddah were opposite each other on the river. Tamaghis,
located in a desolate area to the north on a small oasis, could
properly be called a desert town. Naufana and Ghadis were situated in
mountainous areas to the west and south beyond the perimeter of usual
trade routes between the other cities.</p>

<p>	In addition to the six
cities, there were a number of villages and nomadic tribes. Food was
plentiful and for a time the population was completely stable: no one
was born unless someone died.</p>

<p>	The inhabitants were
divided into an elite minority known as the Transmigrants and a
majority known as the Receptacles. Within these categories were a
number of occupational and specialized strata and the two classes
were not in practice separate. Transmigrants acted as Receptacles and
Receptacles became Transmigrants.</p>

<p>	To show the system in
operation: Here is an old Transmigrant on his deathbed. He has
selected his future Receptacle parents, who are summoned to the death
chamber. The parents then copulate, achieving orgasm just as the old
Transmigrant dies so that his spirit enters the womb to be reborn.
Every Transmigrant carries with him at all times a list of
alternative parents, and in case of accident, violence, or sudden
illness, the nearest parents are rushed to the scene. However, there
was at first little chance of random or unexpected deaths since the
Council of Transmigrants in Waghdas had attained such skill in the
art of prophecy that they were able to chart a life from birth to
death and determine in most cases the exact time and manner of death.</p>

<p>	Many Transmigrants
preferred not to wait for the infirmities of age and the ravages of
illness, lest their spirit be so weakened as to be overwhelmed and
absorbed by the Receptacle child. These hardy Transmigrants, in the
full vigor of maturity, after rigorous training in concentration and
astral projection, would select two death guides to kill them in
front of the copulating parents. The methods of death most commonly
employed were hanging and strangulation, the Transmigrant dying in
orgasm, which was considered the most reliable method of ensuring a
successful transfer. Drugs were also developed, large doses of which
occasioned death in erotic convulsions, smaller doses being used to
enhance sexual pleasure. And these drugs were often used in
conjunction with other forms of death.</p>

<p>	In time, death by
natural causes became a rare and rather discreditable occurrence as
the age for transmigration dropped. The Eternal Youths, a
Transmigrant sect, were hanged at the age of eighteen to spare
themselves the coarsening experience of middle age and the
deterioration of senescence, living their youth again and again.</p>

<p>	Two factors undermined
the stability of this system. The first was perfection of techniques
for artificial insemination. Whereas the traditional practice called
for one death and one rebirth, now hundreds of women could be
impregnated from s ingle sperm collection, and territorially oriented
Transmigrants could populate whole areas with their progeny. There
were sullen mutters of revolt from the Receptacles, especially the
women. At this point, another factor totally unforeseen was
introduced.</p>

<p>	In the thinly
populated desert area north of Tamaghis a portentous event occurred.
Some say it was a meteor that fell to earth leaving a crater twenty
miles across. Others say that the crated was caused by what modern
physicists call a black hole.</p>

<p>	After this occurrence
the whole northern sky lit up red at night, like the reflection from
a vast furnace. Those in the immediate vicinity of the crater were
the first to be affected and various mutations were observed, the
commonest being altered hair and skin color. Red and yellow hair, and
white, yellow, and red skin appeared for the first time. Slowly the
whole area was similarly affected until the mutants outnumbered the
original inhabitants, who were as all human beings were at the time:
black.</p>

<p>	The women, led by an
albino mutant known as the White Tigress, seized Yass-Waddah,
reducing the male inhabitants to slaves, consorts, and courtiers all
under sentence of death that could be carried out at any time at the
caprice of the White Tigress. The Council in Waghdas countered by
developing a method of growing babies in excised wombs, the wombs
being supplied by vagrant Womb Snatchers. This practice aggravated
the differences between the male and female factions and was with
Yass-Waddah seemed unavoidable.</p>

<p>	In Naufana, a method
was found to transfer the spirit directly into an adolescent
Receptacle, thus averting the awkward and vulnerable period of
infancy. This practice required a rigorous period of preparation and
training to achieve a harmonious blending of the two spirits in one
body. These Transmigrants, combining the freshness and vitality of
youth with the wisdom of many lifetimes, were expected to form an
army of liberation to free Yass-Waddah. And there were adepts who
could die at will without any need of drugs or executioners and
project their spirit into a chosen Receptacle.</p>

<p>	I have mentioned
hanging, strangulation, and orgasm drugs as the commonest means of
effecting the transfer. However, many other forms of death were
employed. The Fire Boys were burned to death in the presence of the
Receptacles, only the genitals being insulated, so that the
practitioner could achieve orgasm in the moment of death. There is an
interesting account by a Fire Boy who recalled his experience after
transmigrating in this manner:</p>

<p>	"As the flames
closed round my body, I inhaled deeply, drawing fire into my lings,
and screamed out flames as the most horrible pain turned to the most
exquisite pleasure and I was ejaculating in an adolescent Receptacle
who was being sodomized by another."</p>

<p>	Others were stabbed,
decapitated, disemboweled, shot with arrows, or killed by a blow on
the head. Some threw themselves from cliffs, landing in front of the
copulating Receptacles.</p>

<p>	The scientists at
Waghdas were developing a machine that could directly transfer the
electromagnetic field of one body to another. In Ghadis there were
adepts who were able to leave their bodies before death and occupy a
series of hosts. How far this research may have gone will never be
known. It was a time of great disorder and chaos.</p>

<p>	The effects of the Red
Night on Receptacles and Transmigrants proved to be incalculable and
many strange mutants arose as a series of plagues devastated the
cities. It is this period of war and pestilence that is covered by
the books. The Council had set out to produce a race of supermen for
the exploration of space. They produced instead races of ravening
idiot vampires.</p>

<p>	Finally, the cities
were abandoned and the survivors fled in all directions, carrying the
plagues with them. Some of these migrants crossed the Bering Strait
into the New World, taking the books with them. They settled in the
area later occupied by the Mayans and the books eventually fell into
the hands of the Mayan priests.</p>

<p>	The
alert student of this noble experiment will perceive that death was
regarded as equivalent not to birth but to conception and go on to
infer that conception is the basic trauma. In the moment of death,
the dying man's whole life may flash in front of his eyes back to
conception. In the moment of conception, his future life flashes
forward to his future death. <emphasis>To reexperience conception is fatal</emphasis>.</p>

<p>	This was the basic
error of the Transmigrants: you do not get beyond death and
conception by reexperience any more than you get beyond heroin by
ingesting larger and larger doses. The Transmigrants were quite
literally addicted to death and they needed more and more death to
kill the pain of conception. They were buying parasitic life with a
promissory death note to be paid at a prearranged time. The
Transmigrants then imposed there terms on the host child to ensure
his future transmigration. There was a basic conflict of interest
between the host child and Transmigrant. So the Transmigrants reduced
the Receptacle class to a condition of virtual idiocy. Otherwise they
would have reneged on a bargain from which they stood to gain nothing
but death. The books are flagrant falsifications. And some of these
basic lies are still current.</p>

<p>	"Nothing is true.
Everything is permitted." The last words of Hassan i Sabbah, Old
Man of the Mountain.</p>

<p>	"Tamaghis
... Ba'dan ... Yass-Wadah ... Waghdas ...
Naufana ... Ghadis."</p>

<p>	It
is said that an initiate who wishes to know the answer to any
question need only repeat these words as he falls asleep and the
answer will come in a dream.</p>

<p>	Tamaghis: This is the
open city of contending partisans where advantage shifts from moment
to moment in a desperate biological war. Here everything is as true
as you think it is and everything you can get away with is permitted.</p>

<p>	Ba'dan: This city is
given over to competitive games and commerce. Ba'dan closely
resembles present-day America with a precarious moneyed elite, a
large disaffected middle class and an equally large segment of
criminals and outlaws. Unstable, explosive, and swept by whirlwind
riots. Everything is true and everything is permitted.</p>

<p>	Yass-Waddah: This city
is the femaile stronghold where the Countess de Gulpa, the Countess
de Vile, and the Council of the Selected plot a final subjugation of
the other cities. Every shade of sexual transition is represented:
boys with girls' heads, girls with boys' heads. Here everything is
true and nothing is permitted except to the permitters.</p>

<p>	Waghdas: This is the
university city, the center of learning where all questions are
answered in terms of what can be expressed and understood. Complete
permission derives from complete understanding.</p>

<p>	Naufana
and Ghadis are the cities of illusion where nothing is true and
<emphasis>therefore</emphasis> everything is permitted.</p>

<p>	The traveler must
start in Tamaghis and make his way through the other cities in the
order named. This pilgrimage may take many lifetimes.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>Get out of the</p>

<p>defensive position</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>We now have a
sufficient stockpile of the new weapons to initiate our campaign, and
it seems unwise to delay longer. Sooner or later the enemy will learn
something of our plans and the means we possess to implement them. We
will apply the classic rules of hit-and-run warfare against a larger
force, drawing them deeper into our territory while raiding and
cutting supply lines. This is the tactic that beat Crassus's Roman
Legions in the disastrous Parthian campaign. The Parthians would
suddenly appear over a rise mounted on horses, loose a shower of
arrows and ride away, luring the Romans deeper and deeper into the
desert as thirst, hunger, and disease took their toll. Only a handful
of the Legionnaires made their way back to the sea.</p>

<p>	Once this tactic has
sufficiently weakened the enemy, we will shift to an all-out attack
on a series of enemy positions. Failure to follow through on a
successful attack is as disastrous as attempting an attack against
unfavorable odds. It was this error that lost Hannibal the war
against Rome. He did not realize that he had beaten the whole Roman
army, so instead of marching on the unprotected city without delay,
he retrenched to consolidate his position until he had no position
left.</p>

<p>	We can expect a
landslide of defections to our cause, and we must follow through to
deliver a series of knockout blows. Nor will we allow time for the
French and English to recognize the danger and join Spain against a
common enemy. As soon as we see victory on the way in the southern
hemisphere of the American continent, we will strike in the northern
hemisphere. Then we will open a diplomatic offensive concentrating on
England to negotiate treaties, trade agreements, and recognition of
our independent and sovereign status.</p>

<p>	Of course the new
weapons will be common knowledge in a short time, but by then we will
have a lead that will be difficult to overtake. We will be able to
produce the weapons in any quantity, and by attracting inventors,
skilled workers and technicians with higher wages and better living
conditions, we can continue to turn out better weapons than our
adversaries. We have also the incalculable advantage of a huge
territory virtually impossible to invade successfully, whereas
European countries, with the exception of Russia, are vulnerable to
invasion, since they have no place to retreat to. We expect the
Articles to spread through Africa, the Near and Far East, and we
could invade Spain from North Africa.</p>

<p>	Our immediate plan is
to provoke the Spanish into a massive attack by taking Panama City
and Guayaquil. This should divert much of the Pacific fleet to those
two locations and dispatch land forces from Lima to Guayaquil and
from Cartagena to Panama. If necessary, we shall retreat into the
swamps of southern Panama and to the mountainous and heavily wooded
areas northwest of the city. In the event of decisive land victories,
we will immediately launch attacks on the depleted garrisons at Lima
and Cartagena, inflict what damage we can on the fleet, and at the
same time, strike in Mexico.</p>

<p>	The Iguana twins have
returned to Mexico to organize our movement there, and Bert Hansen
has gone with them. Captain Strobe has gone to Panama to assess the
strength of the Spanish garrison and to organize partisan resistance
to the north and east of the city. The area to the south is already
in our hands. Juanito and Brady, with a force of fifty men, have gone
south to set up fortified positions west of Guayaquil from which the
attack on the city can be launched and to which our forces can
withdraw, luring the Spanish ground forces into a deadly trap.</p>

<p>	The sea battles will
be directed by Opium Jones, Skipper Nordenholz, and Captain Strobe. A
number of Destroyers are under construction.</p><empty-line /><p>Then one morning we
received word on the signal drums that Captain Strobe had been taken
in Panama City and sentenced to hang.</p>

<p>	On receipt of this
news, we set out for Panama City with a force of fifty men armed with
the double-barreled rifles and a good stock of mortars, both of the
type that explode on contact and those that explode from timed fuses.
We had little hope of arriving in time, so we sent back word to the
local partisans to take what measures they could to effect a rescue,
that an expeditionary force was on the way.</p>

<p>	Marching
day and night without sleep, on opium and <emphasis>yoka</emphasis>, we were five
miles south of the city at dawn on the third day. A warm mist
enveloped us and I was reminded of the steam bath in my little
Michigan lake town and found myself walking with an erection.
Suddenly we heard a terrific explosion from the direction of Panama
City and stopped, our faces lifted to the rising sun.</p>

<p>	Shortly thereafter, a
runner informed us that Captain Strobe had been rescued and was
heading south in a fishing boat towards one of Pacific bases opposite
the Pearl Islands. We instructed the runner to inform the Spanish
garrison that the pirates who had engineered the destruction of the
armory and the escape of Captain Strobe were just south of the city,
that they were few in number and almost out of powder. As we had
hoped, the Spanish fell into our trap and immediately dispatched a
column of soldiers in pursuit, leaving only a hundred to guard the
city.</p><empty-line /><p>The country here is low
hills with outcroppings of limestone, ideally suited for ambush. We
select a narrow valley between slopes strewn with limestone boulders.
Rocky terrain is the best for mortar attacks. We dispose twenty men
on each slope, about fifty yards from the path the Spanish column
will take. The remaining ten will serve as decoys, fleeing as the
soldiers approach. Once the concealed riflemen open up on the enemy
flanks, they will seek cover and fire directly into the Spanish
column, who will then be caught in a three-way fire. Concealed behind
boulders, we settle down to wait.</p>

<p>	It is not long before
the Spanish appear. There are about two hundred men in the column,
with four officers on horseback. As they catch sight of the decoys,
the officers urge their horses on, shouting to the men to follow. The
lead officer, a major, is leaning forward in the saddle, his sword
raised, his teeth bared under a bristling black mustache. Using a
rifle with contact mortar, I take careful aim, leading the horse by
four feet to allow for forward speed. Even so, I miscalculate
slightly, and the mortar hits the horse in the withers instead of in
the shoulder as I had intended. The explosion blows the major out of
the saddle and over the horse's head. His sword flies out of his
severed right hand in a glittering arc. The horse rears, screaming
and kicking, entrails spilling from a gaping hole.</p>

<p>	My shot is the signal
for the others to open up, bouncing mortars off boulders by the foot
soldiers and under the horses. One officer whirls and gallops back
towards the city. After two rounds of mortar fire, we shift to the
double-barreled rifles. In a few minutes, all but a handful are dead
or dying and the survivors are fleeing back to the city in a blind
panic. I give the signal to hold fire, since the accounts carried by
the fugitives will place our number at five to eight hundred. The
rumor of a large force of well-armed privateers, probably English,
will spread panic in the city, whose defenders are now reduced to a
scant hundred men.</p>

<p>	We advance to the
outskirts of the city, where a party of officers display a flag of
truce to indicate that they wish to parley. We state our terms as
immediate and unconditional surrender of the garrison and the city,
telling the officers that we have better than eight hundred men
behind us. If they surrender the city, we promise to spare the lives
of the Governor, the officers and soldiers, and all the inhabitants.
If not, we will kill any who offer the slightest resistance, and will
sack and burn the city. They have no option except to agree.</p>

<p>	Meanwhile, about three
hundred local partisans have gathered, armed with weapons taken from
the dead, since we do not want the officers to see the new weapons
until we are able to effectively seal the city. We then stipulate
that all soldiers, officers and armed civilians must come to this
spot and lay down their arms. Anyone subsequently found in possession
of arms will be summarily executed.</p>

<p>	The soldiers, having
laid down their arms, are ordered to remove their uniforms, boots and
socks. Clad only in undergarments, they are marched to the garrison
and locked in. The officers, the Governor, the wealthy inhabitants,
and the clergy, protesting the indignity, are locked in the prison
after all the prisoners have been released.</p>

<p>	We post notices to the
inhabitants to go about their daily business and to fear no harm. We
set up the Articles in public places, impound all ships in the
harbor, and post guards at all exits. No boat may leave the harbor
and no person may leave the city.</p>

<p>	For the next two days,
while we are catching up on our sleep, the soldiers, officers and
hostages are to be given adequate food, but the partisans who guard
them and bring the food have orders not to talk or to answer any
questions.</p>

<p>	On the third day,
fully rested, we gather around a conference table in the governmental
dining room. News of our success has spread throughout the area, and
there are now more than five hundred partisans gathered in the city,
more than enough for routine guard duty. We consult maps and
formulate plans for a series of attacks on the Spanish-held garrisons
on the east side of the isthmus. These garrisons are for the most
part small, and will be no match for our mortars. Within a month, we
will control a string of garrisons from Port Roger to northern
Panama. It is decided that the post of Commandante shall rotate each
day. Since the ambush was largely according to my plan, I will assume
the first shift.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>We are the language</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>As
I was reading the <emphasis>Cities of the Red Night</emphasis> text, the Iguana
sister brought some books and put them down on the table. I laid
aside the folder.</p>

<p>	"Who wrote this?"</p>

<p>	"A scholar who
prefers to remain anonymous. Research into this area is not
reinforced. If, as he suggests, conception is the basic trauma, then
it is also the basic instrument of control." She gestured to the
books stacked on the table. I saw at a glance that they were
elaborately bound in a variety of colors. They looked very expensive.</p>

<p>	"These are
copies. Please study them carefully. I will pay one million dollars
for recovery of the originals."</p>

<p>	"How good are the
copies?"</p>

<p>	"Almost perfect."</p>

<p>	"Then why do you
want the originals? Collector's vanity?"</p>

<p>	"Changes,
Mr. Snide, can only be effected by alterations in the <emphasis>original</emphasis>.
The only thing not prerecorded in a prerecorded universe are the
prerecordings themselves. The copies can only repeat themselves word
for word. <emphasis>A virus is a copy.</emphasis> You can pretty it up, cut it up,
scramble it—it will reassemble in the same form. Without being
an idealist, I am reluctant to see the originals in the hands of the
Countess de Gulpa, the Countess de Vile and the pickle factory...."</p>

<p>	"I don't need a
pep talk—but I do need a retainer."</p>

<p>	She
laid out a check for two hundred thousand cools on the table. I began
examining the books, skipping through to get a general impression.
They are composed in a variety of styles and periods. Some of them
seem to stem from the 1920s of <emphasis>The Great Gatsby</emphasis>, old sport,
and others to derive from the Edwardian era of Saki, reflecting an
unbearably flawed boyishness. There is an underlying current of
profound frivolity, with languid young aristocrats drawling epigrams
in streets of disease, war, and death. There is a Rover Boys-Tom
Swift story line where boy heroes battle against desperate odds.</p>

<p>	The books are color
comics. "Jokes," Jim calls them. Some lost color process
has been used to transfer three-dimensional holograms onto the
curious tough translucent parchment-like material of the pages. You
ache to look at these colors. Impossible reds, blues, sepias. Colors
you can smell and taste and feel with your whole body. Children's
books against a Bosch background; legends, fairy stories, stereotyped
characters, surface motivations with a child's casual cruelty. What
facts could have given rise to such legends?</p>

<p>	A
form of radiation unknown at the present time activated a virus. This
virus illness occasioned biologic mutations, especially alterations
in hair and skin color, which were then genetically conveyed. The
virus must have affected the sexual and fear centers in the brain and
nervous system so that fear was converted into sexual frenzies which
were reconverted into fear, the feedback leading in many cases to a
fatal conclusion. The virus information was genetically conveyed, in
orgasms that were often fatal. It seems likely that the burnings,
stabbings, poisonings, stranglings, and hangings were largely
terminal hallucinations produced by the virus, at a point where the
line between illusion and reality breaks down. Over a period of
generations the virus established a benign symbiosis with the host.
It was a mutating virus, a <emphasis>color</emphasis> virus, as if the colors
themselves were possessed of a purposeful and sinister life. The
books are probably no more representative of life at the time than a
<emphasis>Saturday Evening Post</emphasis> cover by Norman Rockwell represents the
complex reality of American life.</p>

<p>	"Are
these complete copies of the originals I am retained to find, or
should I say <emphasis>uncover</emphasis>?"</p>

<p>	"No, these are
fragments."</p>

<p>	"You have some
idea as to what the other books contain?" I asked.</p>

<p>	She glanced at the
check. "Do you?"</p>

<p>	I nodded. "They
may contain the truth, which these books cover with a surface so
horrible and so nauseously prettified that it remains impervious as a
mirror." I put the check in my wallet. "And as misleading,"
I added. I returned to the books.</p>

<p>	As I read on, I became
increasingly aware of a feeling of faintness and malaise. The colors
were giving me a headache—the deep electric blue of the
southern sky, the explosions of green by the pools and waterways, the
clothes of tight-fitting red velvet, the purples, red, and pinks of
diseased skin—rising from the books palpable as a haze, a
poisonous miasma of color.</p>

<p>	I loosened my collar,
my thoughts hazy and somehow not my own, as if someone were
delivering a lecture on the books, of which I caught an occasional
phrase ... captions in English? "At one time a language existed
that was immediately comprehensible to anyone with the concept of
language." A World War I ambulance?</p>

<p>	As
I tried to examine it more closely, I could not be sure, but I <emphasis>had</emphasis>
seen it with photographic clarity ... an old sepia photo circa 1917.
"They have removed the temporal limits."</p>

<p>	I looked up with a
start, as if I had been dozing. The Iguana and her brother were not
in the room. I had not seen them go. Jim was sitting on one side of
me and Kiki on the other. They seemed to be equally affected.</p>

<p>	"Whewwww ..."
said Jim. "I need a good hooker of brandy."</p>

<p>	<emphasis>"Muy
mereado,"</emphasis> said Kiki. <emphasis>"No quiero ver más...."</emphasis></p>

<p><emphasis>	</emphasis>Jim
and Kiki walk over to a cabinet bar in the corner of the room. I pick
up a book bound in red skin. In a deeper shade of red: <emphasis>The First
Redhead</emphasis>.</p>

<p>	A blond boy with a
noose around his neck blushes deeper and deeper, red washing through
his body, his lips swelling as the red tide sweeps into his hair and
ripples down his chest to the crotch, down his legs, dusting his skin
with red hairs that glisten in a soft fire, heart pounding against
his ribs like a caged bird....</p>

<p>	I
pick up a book with a heavy blue cover like flexible metal. In gold
letters: <emphasis>The Blue Mutant</emphasis>. As I open the book I get a whiff of
ozone.</p>

<p>	A boy with a blue rash
around his crotch, neck, and nipples, burning his asshole and crotch,
a slow cold burn behind his ear, the blue color in his eyes, pale
blue of northern skies washed across the whites, the pupils deep
purple, blue shit burning in his ass like melting solder ... the
smell of the Blue Mutant Fever fills the room, a rotten metal meat
smell that steams off him as he shits a smoldering blue
phosphorescent excrement. His pubic and rectal hairs turn bright blue
and crackle with sparks....</p>

<p>	I was looking at the
books from above in a spacecraft coming in for a landing.</p><empty-line /><p>A purple twilight lay
over the sad languorous city. We were driven to a villa on the
outskirts of Lima. The house was surrounded by the usual high wall,
topped with broken glass like sugar crystals on a cake. Two floors,
balcony on the second floor, bougainvillea climbing over the front of
the house.</p>

<p>	The driver carried the
luggage in and gave us the keys. He also gave me a guidebook in which
certain shops and business addresses were checked.</p>

<p>	We had a look around.
The furniture looked like a window display: solid, expensive,
undistinguished. Glassed bookcases were filled with leather-bound
encyclopedias, Dickens, Thackeray, Kipling, books on the flora and
fauna of South America, bird books and books on navigation. Nowhere
did I see any indication that anyone had ever lived there.</p>

<p>	Consulting
a map of Lima, on a glass-covered coffee table spread with some
issues of the <emphasis>National Geographic</emphasis>, I looked up the addresses.
All in or near the Mercado Mayorista. One was an art-supply
store....Hmmmm....I had already decided to fabricate the complete
books if I could find the right paper. In fact, I felt sure that this
was exactly what I was being paid to do. An address in the Mercado
was Blum &amp; Krup Import-Export. This was my contact.</p><empty-line /><p>The Mercado Mayorista
of Lima occupies about four square blocks. Here vegetables, fruits,
pigs, chickens and other produce are brought in by truck from all
over Peru to be unloaded and sold. The shops, booths, bars, and
restaurants are open twenty-four hours a day. The only thing
comparable to the Mercado Mayorista is the Djemalfnaa of Marrakesh.
The Djemalfnaa, however, has been a tourist attraction for so long
that millions of cameras have sucked its vitality and dimmed its
colors.</p>

<p>	The Mercado is seldom
visited by tourists and is no conceived as a folkloric spectacle. It
has a definite function and the folklore is incidental. Street
performers gather here because there are always spectators with
money.</p>

<p>	We walked on, passing
little restaurants serving hot fish soup, meat on spits, brown bread
... bars with jukeboxes and boys dancing, Chinese restaurants, snake
charmers, a trick bicycle rider, trained monkeys. Very faintly I
could hear the pipes of Pan.</p>

<p>	Some distance away
there was a small circle of onlookers. A boy was playing a bamboo
flute. He was about fifteen years old, with yellow hair, blue eyes,
and a dusting of freckles on a broad face. Looking into the boy's
eyes, I experienced a shock of recognition. His eyes were blank and
empty as the blue sky over the market, devoid of any human
expression: Pan, the Goat God. The music went on playing in my head,
trickled down mountainsides in a blue twilight, rustling through
glades and grass, twinkling on starlit streams, drifting down windy
streets with autumn leaves.</p>

<p>	I decided to visit the
art-supply store alone. What I wanted would be under the counter.
Anyone handling that kind of paper and ink would be into art forgery,
probably passports and documents as well. Two visitors would queer
the deal. Kiki wanted to look around the town anyway, and Jim needed
some photographic equipment.</p>

<p>	The store was on a
dingy narrow street near the market. There were some dusty canvasses,
easels, and tubes of paint in the window, reminiscent of the rubber
sandwiches served in Swedish bars to legitimize the sale of liquor.
When I tried the door I found that it was locked. I knocked, and the
door was finally opened by a middle-aged man with heavy rimless
glasses who looked at me suspiciously.</p>

<p>	<emphasis>"Vous
voulez?"</emphasis></p>

<p>	<emphasis>"Du
papier, monsieur!"</emphasis></p>

<p>	<emphasis>"Entrez."</emphasis>
He stood aside and locked the door behind me. A fattish woman with
frizzy blonde hair and large diamonds on her liver-spotted fingers
sat at an ancient cash register. She had been reading Le Figaro,
which lay on the counter. She looked frightened. So did he. War
criminals, I decided matter-of-factly. French collaborators.</p>

<p>	<emphasis>"J'ai
besoin de papier pour une tâche spéciale.... Des livres
qui devraient paraître anciens."</emphasis></p>

<p><emphasis>	</emphasis>He
nodded and something like a smile touched his thin lips. <emphasis>"Par
ici, monsieur."</emphasis></p>

<p><emphasis>	</emphasis>He
led the way to a back room containing a long oak table and several
chairs. Iron cabinets with cylinder locks occupied one wall. He
looked at me sharply.</p>

<p>	<emphasis>"Ah
oui."</emphasis> He gestured to the cabinets. <emphasis>"L'histoire,
monsieur, à votre disposition ... quelle époque? Vous
cherchez peut-être un codex mayan? Un papyrus d'Égypte?
Quelque chose du Moyen Age?"</emphasis></p>

<p>	<emphasis>"Plus
récent ... Dix-huitième ... environ 1702."</emphasis></p>

<p>	<emphasis>"Et
l'auteur, monsieur? Gentilhomme, courtisane, voleur?"</emphasis> And
the author? Gentleman, courtesan, thief?</p>

<p>	<emphasis>"Pirate
américain."</emphasis></p>

<p>	<emphasis>"Parfaitment."</emphasis>
He opened a little casket with a key from his vest pocket and
selected from it another key. With this he opened a cabinet in which
I could see packages in cubbyholes, and brought out several packets
tied and sealed with red wax.</p>

<p>	<emphasis>"De
Boston."</emphasis></p>

<p>	<emphasis>"Parfaitment."</emphasis>
I examined the parchment carefully, holding it up to the light and
looking at it under a magnifying glass. I nodded and smiled. <emphasis>"Très
bien."</emphasis></p>

<p>	<emphasis>"De
l'encre?"</emphasis></p>

<p>	<emphasis>"Oui."</emphasis></p>

<p>	He
opened another cabinet full of bottles and jars and tubes.... <emphasis>"Ça."</emphasis></p>

<p>	I
brought out my portable kit and ran some tests. <emphasis>"Ça
marche ... ça marche....j'ai besoin aussi de couleurs....
C'est un livre illustré."</emphasis></p>

<p>	<emphasis>"De
couleurs parfumées, monsieur?"</emphasis></p>

<p>	<emphasis>"Mais
bien entendu ... d'hachissh, d'opium, du sang, du rhum, encens
d'église, de latrines, du pourriture ..."</emphasis></p>

<p><emphasis>	</emphasis>The
package came to $10,000 plus $300 of regular art supplies.</p>

<p>	<emphasis>"Alors,
monsieur, vous avez le temps pour un cognac?"</emphasis></p>

<p>	<emphasis>"J'ai
toujours le temps pour ça."</emphasis></p><empty-line /><p>We start making books.
I write the continuity. Jim does the drawings. We have the address of
a modeling agency which puts us in touch with the film underground.
We are in the right place.</p>

<p>	Lima is the film
studio of the world for far-out porn and snuff films, mostly on
contract to collectors and governmental agencies. Only the third-rate
material finds its way into the open market. The best camera work,
processing, special effects, and actors of all nationalities can be
had here for a price.</p>

<p>	Jim sketches a scene
in the rough. We stage it with live actors and then photograph it.
Then Jim projects the color shots onto our paper for the finished
product, which is something between photography and drawing and looks
quite a lot like the Iguanas' "joke books."</p>

<p>	Monsieur
La Tour sells quality merchandise. The
books seem to age two hundred years overnight. I am working mostly on
my pirate story line. but since I am sure of the quality of the
goods, I will invest some more money in Mayan and Egyptian papers and
colors, and do two snuff films—a Mayan number called <emphasis>The
Child of Ix Tab</emphasis>, and an Egyptian number called <emphasis>The Curse of
the Pharaohs</emphasis>.</p>

<p>	Ix Tab was the patron
saint of those who hang themselves, whom she would transport straight
to Paradise. In this number a young aristocrat is hanged by Ix Tab,
who then gives birth to a superpotent Death Baby. The boy who plays
the young aristocrat has a classic Mayan profile, and Ix Tab, spotted
with decay, is a versatile pro who also plays in my Egyptian number
as the evil sister of Tutankhamen—she has him strangled and
gives birth to a Scorpion Goddess.</p>

<p>	A million dollars is
shrinking to expense-account money at this point. I am already a
hundred thousand clams into the $200,000. I figure it is about time
to look up Blum and Krup before they come looking for me. It's a
small town and word gets around.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>A cowboy in the</p>

<p>seven-days-a-week fight</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>Tamaghis is a walled
city built of red adobe. The city stirs at sunset, for the days are
unbearably hot at this season and the inhabitants nocturnal. As the
sun sets the northern sky lights up with a baleful red glow, bathing
the city in light that shades from seashell pink to deep-purple
shadow pools.</p>

<p>	It is a summer night
and the air is warm and electric with a smell of incense, ozone, and
the musky sweet rotten red smell of the fever. Jerry, Audrey,
Dahlfar, Jon, Joe, and John Kelley are walking through a quarter of
massage parlors, Turkish baths, sex rooms, hanging studios, cubicle
restaurants, booths selling incense, aphrodisiacs and aromatic herbs.
Music drifts from nightclubs, sometimes a whiff of opium smoke—the
Painless Ones who run many of the concessions smoke it.</p>

<p>	The boys pause at a
booth and Audrey buys some Red Hots from a Painless One. This
aphrodisiac causes an erogenous rash in the crotch, anus, and on the
nipples. It acts within seconds, taken orally, or it can be
injected—but this is dangerous since the pleasure is often so
intense that it stops the heart. Adolescents of the city play red-hot
dare games known as Hots and Pops.</p>

<p>	The boys are dressed
in red silk tunics open on their lean bodies, red silk pants, and
magnetic sandals. At their belts they carry spark guns and long
knives, sharp on both edges, that curl slightly at the end. Knife
fights are frequent here since Red Hots can set off the raw red
Killing Fever.</p>

<p>	The virus is like a
vast octopus through bodies of the city, mutating in protean forms:
the Killing Fever, the Flying Fever, the Black hate Fever. In all
cases the total energies of the subject are focused on one activity
or objective. There is a Gambling Fever and a Money Fever which
sometimes infect the Painless One—eyes glittering, they draw in
the money with a terrible eagerness, trembling like hungry shrews.
There is also an Activity Fever: the victims rushing about in a
frenzy organizing anything, acting as agents for anything or anybody,
prowling the streets desperately looking for contacts.</p>

<p>	Red Night in Tamaghis:
Dog Catchers, Spermers, Sirens, and the Special Police from the
Council of the Selected who are infiltrating Tamaghis from
Yass-Waddah. The Dog Catchers will seize any youths they encounter in
the Fair Game areas and sell them off to hanging studios and sperm
brokers. The Spermers are pirates operating from strongholds outside
the city walls, attacking caravans and supply trains, tunneling under
the walls to prowl in the rubbly outskirts of the city. They are
outlaws who may be killed by any citizen, like cattle rustlers.</p>

<p>	Two boys, faces
blazing with alertness, slide from one red shadow pool to another. A
patrol of Dog Catchers passes. The boys crouch in the darkness by a
ruined wall, teeth bare, hands on their knives. The Dog Catchers are
muscular youths with heavy thighs and the deep chests of runners.
Naked to the waist, they carry a variety of nets and handcuffs around
their shoulders, and bolos that can tangle legs at twenty yards. On
leads are the hairless red sniffhounds, quivering, whimpering,
sniffing, trying to fuck the Dog Catchers' legs. Audrey's lips part
in a slow smile. This is one of his infiltration tactics: the dogs
are trained to wrap themselves around a Dog Catcher's legs and trip
him up.</p><empty-line /><p>Audrey
and Cupid Mount Etna are in a populous area with wide stone streets,
A flower float of Sirens passes. In conch shells of roses they trill:
"I'm going to <emphasis>pop</emphasis> you naked darling and <emphasis>milk</emphasis> you
while you're being <emphasis>hanged</emphasis>...."</p>

<p>	Idiot males are
rushing up, jumping on the hanging float to be hanged by the Sirens,
many of whom are transvestites from Yass-Waddah. The floats wind on
towards the hanging Gardens where the golden youths gather with their
Hanging Exempt badges. Like characters in a charade they pose and
pirouette in the red glow that lights trees, pools, and diseased
faces burning with the terrible lusts of the fever.</p>

<p>	Audrey decided on a
detour. Four Special Police from the Council of the Selected stand in
their way. They are crew-cut men in blue suits, looking like
religious FBI men with muscular Christian smiles.</p>

<p>	"What can we do
for you?"</p>

<p>	"Drop dead."
Audrey snaps. He draws his spark gun and gives them a full blast.
They fall twitching and smoking. Officially the SPs have no standing
in Tamaghis, but they are bribing the local police and kidnapping
boys for the transplant operation rooms of Yass-Waddah.</p>

<p>	The boys sprint around
the bodies and turn into an alley, police whistles behind them.
Possession of a spark gun is a capital offense. Dodging and twisting
through the maze of narrow streets, tunnels, and gangways, they lose
the patrol.</p><empty-line /><p>They are on the
outskirts now, near the walls, walking down a steep stone road. There
is a road above them and a steep grassy slope leading up to it.
Suddenly, a World War I ambulance truck stops on the high road and
six men jump out got up as pirates with beards and earrings. They
rush down the slope, eyes flashing with greed.</p>

<p>	"Spermers!"</p>

<p>	Audrey drops on one
knee, raking the slope with his spark gun. the Spermers scream,
rolling down the slope, clothes burning, setting the grass on fire.
The truck is burning. Audrey and Cupid sprint on as the gas tank
explodes behind them.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>The unconscious

Double Gallows is <emphasis>the</emphasis> late place in Tamaghis. At 11:30 it is
still nearly empty. The bartended is checking bottles and polishing
glasses. SOme character is freaking out at the bar.</p>

<p>	"We're all a
bunch of dirty rotten vampires!" he screams. The bouncer throws
him out.</p>

<p>	"We don't like
that in here. I mean it."</p>

<p>	A Siren undulates in
and trills for service.</p>

<p>	"You
see that sign, lady?" The bartender points to a picture of a
Siren with a noose: "... <emphasis>will not be served here."</emphasis>
The bouncer hustles her out.</p>

<p>	It's
an exclusive-type place where <emphasis>everybody</emphasis> goes. What do people
do in Tamaghis? They see the Show. They all come here and see the big
Show. There's a hanging show every night. The bar is filling up now,
because this is Flasher Night. The chic clients make their entrances
through trapdoors in the floor and ceiling, or through disused side
entrances, and even now they are popping up through the floor in
green drag screaming like mandrakes, dropping down through the
ceiling in gauzy parachutes or with ropes around their necks,
slithering in through mirrors and screens. Some are completely naked
but most wear at least cowboy chaps, or scarves, or capes, or masks,
or body paint, or sarongs, or snakeskin jockstraps, or Mercury
sandals, or Scythian boots, or Etruscan helmets, or space suits with
transparent ass and crotch.</p>

<p>	Noose peddlers
circulate among the clients, stopping here and there as a table of
young aristocrats feel the nooses, which are of various grades and
materials—silk in all colors, hemp cured and softened in rare
unguents, tingle nooses burning with a soft blue flame, leather
nooses made from sniffhound hide.</p>

<p>	Audrey drops a noose
languidly and waves to Jim across the room. Jim comes over and sits
at his table. Audrey introduces him to Rubble Blood Pu, a slim
elegant youth dressed in expensive nineteenth-century clothes with a
red rope mark around his neck, and to Captain Strobe, the Gentleman
Spermer, in eighteenth-century clothes, his yellow hair in a pigtail.
Strobe too has the hemp marks around his neck. Cupid Mount Etna with
a cupid-bow mouth, yellow goat eyes, and curly hair, is naked except
for goat-hood sandals. Blindish Wasp, black sideburns, eyebrows that
completely cover the eye sockets, thin purple lips, is shaped like a
wasp—thin rounded chest, a waist so narrow Jim could have put
his hands around it, long thin legs. His skin is dead white and
shiny, his cock pointed. He is naked except for a black skullcap and
black pointed shoes of soft leather. He gives of a sharp aromatic
odor.</p>

<p>	The
guests are becoming impatient. <emphasis>"Pop Pop Pop,"</emphasis> they
scream.</p>

<p>	Lights
go on in a little alcove and there is the double gallows. It's a
hologram and it makes you queasy to look at it floating there in
stagnant rotten air like a solid mirage you can almost drink out of
and almost smell. The star is a dummy called Whitey because he cost
as much as the white shark in <emphasis>Jaws</emphasis>. A door opens on the
gallows and Whitey is led in by a red demon as the clients caper
around the gallows, standing on tiptoe and twisting their heads to
one side and making clicking sounds with their tongues.</p>

<p>	Now Whitey stands with
the noose around his neck, pelvis tilted forward, cock almost hard,
pupils pinpointed. The platform falls and he hangs there ejaculating
and a blaze of light flashes out his eyes.</p>

<p>	"A Flasher! A
Flasher!" The clients throw up their arms and wriggle their hips
forward ecstatically, bathing in the flash, pushing each other aside,
wallowing about in heaps.</p>

<p>	The gallows
disappears. In an old silent film 1920s guests are jumping into a
swimming pool.</p>

<p>	"Come along to
our digs, old sport," says Rubble Blood Pu. "This place is
getting vulgar."</p>

<p>	Pu leads the way
through an area of vacant lots, rubble, and half-demolished buildings
overgrown with weeds, scrub, and vines.</p>

<p>	"Here we are."</p>

<p>	He stops in front of a
three-story building. The two lower floors are torn down to the
girders and concrete stairs lead to the third floor. Pu unlocks a
heavy door.</p>

<p>	The third floor is
furnished in Moroccan style with rugs and cushions and low tables.
Five of the kraut kids, all naked, are smoking hash. One gets up and
does a belly dance while the others, at the four points of the
compass, roll on their backs, legs in the air, clapping with their
feet as they sing.</p><empty-line /><p>They wear no clothes</p>

<p>And they dance up on
their toes</p>

<p>And the dance they do</p>

<p>Is enough to kill a Jew</p><empty-line /><p>Rubble Blood Pu and
Captain Strobe are both very slender, with small aristocratic
genitals, and they manage to look elegantly attired and perfectly
poised when naked. A boy with long flaxen hair and flaring ears,
naked except for a helmet, brings a tray of mint tea.</p>

<p>	Pu shows Jim how to
hold the glass by top and bottom so as not to burn his hand.... "Come
along and I'll show you around the house."</p>

<p>	The kraut kids trail
along, laughing and goosing each other.</p>

<p>	"And here is the
gallows room ... all modern and convenient, as you can see ... our
subjects wear hanging helmets ... show him, Igor."</p>

<p>	Igor walks up
grinning. The helmet extends around the neck and down to the
collarbone, glares around the ears, and covers the shaven scalp.</p>

<p>	"You see there
are wires for brain waves to be recorded over here; throat mikes in
the helmet ... and this." He holds up a little ring of
transparent elastic. "Always tailormade, of course ... and these
magnetic tingle disks for the nipples. And the noose, scented with
the subject's special smells—you know, his dirty underwear and
jacked-off-in handkerchiefs. We've always been vampires, old
sport.... It's in the family." He takes a last look around. "The
best that money can buy ... still it's a bit confining, old sport—if
you know what I mean. All in the mind, you know...."</p>

<p>	The room behind him
turns into Gatsby's booklined study.</p>

<p>*</p><empty-line /><p>"<emphasis>One
of your dizzy spells?</emphasis>"</p>

<p>	<emphasis>Hans
takes my arm. The boys have sated themselves for the moment. They are
sitting around, shoulder to shoulder, passing cannabis cigarettes.</emphasis></p>

<p>	"Cuidado,
hombre."</p>

<p>	<emphasis>A
boy brushes a spark from his naked thigh ...soft distant voices in
the warm dusk. We are walking back through the stale air of Panama
that eddies around our bodies and settles behind us. No fresh breezes
stir here. The city is like a closed room, full of stale flowers and
stagnant water.</emphasis></p><empty-line /><p>"And no, old
sport, there is someone I want you to meet ... better nip in here
first." He opens the door into a luxurious bathroom. "See
you in the drawing room."</p>

<p>	When Jim gets up to
the drawing room, he sees a red-haired girl looking like Jerry's twin
sister, dressed in red silk pajamas. The kraut kids sprawl in front
of her, jacking off like she is a pinup.</p>

<p>	Audrey looks at his
wristwatch. He is on patrol with Cupid Mount Etna. Time to hit the
street.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>We are coordinated</p>

<p>the guard is manifold</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>Kelly, Clinch Todd,
Hans, and myself proceed now to the garrison to review the captured
soldiers. Massive walls with four gun towers surround a courtyard
along which living quarters are ranged. Hans and I, flanked by ten
partisans carrying razor-sharp machetes, step into the courtyard
while Kelley, Todd, and Jon remain in the wardroom behind the bars.</p>

<p>	"Ten<emphasis>shun</emphasis>!"
They understand that in any language.</p>

<p>	The soldiers shamble
into a ragged line. Dirty, unshaven, frightened, they would seem to
pose no threat. I walk slowly up and down, looking at each face in
turn. A sorry lot for the most part, stupid and brutal, many of them
showing the ravages of drink and disease. But two faces do stand out:
a think hawk-faced youth with piercing gray eyes who meets my regard
steadily, and a pimply boy with red hair who gives me an ingratiating
smile.</p>

<p>	"How many of you
can read?"</p>

<p>	The hawk-faced youth
and two others raise their hands. A fourth raises his hand halfway.</p>

<p>	"Well, can you
read or can't you?"</p>

<p>	"Well, yes sir,
but it takes me some time."</p>

<p>	"You'll have
plenty of that." I point to the Articles. "I want those of
you who can read to read what is written there. I want you to read it
carefully. Then I want you to explain what is written there to those
who can't read. Is that clear?"</p>

<p>	The hawk-faced youth
nods with a slight smile.</p>

<p>	"I'll be back
later to see if what is written there has been read and understood."</p>

<p>	We then proceed to the
house where the women are held, to be greeted by a chorus of shrewish
complaints. No one will talk to them or tell them what had happened
to their sons, husbands, and brothers. They have been denied medical
attention and prevented from going to Mass.</p>

<p>	I apologize smoothly
for the temporary inconvenience and assure them that their husbands,
son, and brothers are safe and being well cared for. I tell them that
I am a qualified physician, and that if any of them are suffering
from any pains or illnesses I will be glad to receive them one by one
in a room I have set up as my office. I have also brought a priest
who will hear confession, grant absolutions, or perform any other
priestly offices of which they are in need. The "priest" is
none other than Half-Hanged Kelley, his hemp marks covered by a
clerical collar.</p>

<p>	One
by one, they troop into my office complaining of headaches,
backaches, toothaches, chills and fever, shingles, flatulence,
cramps, palpitations, catarrhs, varicose veins, fainting spells,
neuralgia, and other ailments difficult to classify. To each I give a
draft containing four grams of opium, with instructions to repeat the
dose if their trouble returns, which of course it will at the end of
eight hours when the opium wears off. Needless to say, Kelley is also
kept busy by the pious <emphasis>señoras</emphasis>.</p>

<p>	Returning to the
garrison, I call the soldiers to attention. I walk down the line
directing the three readers and the half-reader to stand forward. I
then pick out six more, looking for faces and bodies that are
reasonably well favored or show some signs of adaptability,
intelligence, and good character. These ten being brought to the
wardroom, I ask if they have read the Articles or had the Articles
explained to them.</p>

<p>	"'Article One: No
man may be imprisoned for debt.' What does this Article mean to you?"</p>

<p>	A
fresh-faced boy with an impudent smile and reddish hair speaks up:
"Suppose I run up a bill in the <emphasis>cantina</emphasis> and can't pay?"</p>

<p>	I
explain that debts to an innkeeper fall into a special category. If
no one paid, there would be no <emphasis>cantinas</emphasis> and no wine.</p>

<p>	The
hawk-faced boy asks: "Does this mean that you intend to release
all peons even though they stand in debt to the <emphasis>patrón</emphasis>?"</p>

<p>	"It means exactly
that. We intend to abolish the peonage system."</p>

<p>	A mulatto boy looks at
me suspiciously. Blank faces of the others show me they know nothing
of the peonage system or how it operates.</p>

<p>	"'Article Two: No
man may enslave another.' What does this mean to you?"</p>

<p>	"Does this mean
we get out of the army?" the pimply boy asks.</p>

<p>	I explain that the
Spanish army does not exist in areas we control. Our army consists
entirely of volunteers.</p>

<p>	"What do you
pay?"</p>

<p>	"We pay in
freedom and equal shares of any booty we take. The gold we have taken
here in Panama will be shared equally among the soldiers who took
part in the operation."</p>

<p>	"I want to
volunteer." He smiled and rubbed his crotch. Not intelligent
exactly, but quick, intuitive, and brazen. A shameless one.</p>

<p>	"What's your
name?"</p>

<p>	"Paco."</p>

<p>	"Yes, Paco, you
can volunteer."</p>

<p>	"You mean you're
going to abolish slavery?" the mulatto youth asked suspiciously.</p>

<p>	"I mean exactly
that."</p>

<p>	"I'll believe it
when I see it."</p>

<p>	"'No man may
interfere in any way with the religious beliefs or practices of
another.' What does this mean to you?"</p>

<p>	"We don't have to
go to Mass?"</p>

<p>	"That's right.
Nor may you prevent anyone else from doing so."</p>

<p>	"That would apply
to other religions? To Moors and Jews?" the hawk-faced boy
asked.</p>

<p>	"Of course ...
'Article Four: No man may be subjected to torture for any reason.'"</p>

<p>	"How will you get
information from prisoners?"</p>

<p>	"There are easier
ways of doing that, as you will see. 'Article Five: No man may
interfere with the sexual practices of another or force any sexual
act on another against his or her will.' What does this mean to you?"</p>

<p>	"You mean if I
fuck another boy in the ass no one can say anything?"</p>

<p>	"They can say
what they like but they cannot interfere. If they do you would be
justified in taking whatever measures were necessary to protect your
freedom and your person, and anyone under the Articles would be bound
to assist you."</p>

<p>	The half-reader spoke
up for the first time. "Sergeant Gonzalez and Corporal
Hassanavitch kicked two soldiers to death for sodomy."</p>

<p>	"Did they
indeed?"</p>

<p>	"If the sergeant
finds out I told you that he'll have a knife in me."</p>

<p>	"A knife?"</p>

<p>	"Yes sir. He has
a knife strapped to his leg."</p>

<p>	"Interesting ...
'Article Six: No man may be put to death except for violation of the
Articles. All officers of the Inquisition stand condemned under this
Article and subject to immediate execution.' Do any of you know of
any such officers present in Panama City?"</p>

<p>	"Father Domingo
and Father Gomez are officers of the Inquisition," said the
hawk-faced youth. "Sent here to deal with pirates. They wanted
to burn the English pirate as a heretic."</p>

<p>	"Thank you. You
will be rewarded for the information." The hawk-faced boy looked
at me haughtily.</p>

<p>	"I want no
reward."</p>

<p>	"Good."
I turned to the half-reader. "And don't worry about the
sergeant. I am having him removed from the garrison." The others
were similarly processed in groups of ten. Only fifteen were suitable
to be trained as partisans. Ten were obviously incorrigible rogues
and troublemakers, chief among them being Sergeant Gonzalez, a
snarling buck-toothed two-hundred-pound hulk, and Corporal
Hassanavitch, a rat-faced gypsy. These ten bastards were marched to
the guardhouse adjacent to the garrison and locked in. In taking
leave of them I gave Sergeant Gonzales a bottle of anise-flavored
<emphasis>aguardiente</emphasis> containing enough opium to kill five men,
enjoining him to share it equally with his companions. He leered at
me showing his yellow teeth.</p>

<p>	"Síííí,
Señor Capitán."</p>

<p>	At the prison I
summoned the resident clergymen to a small interrogation room. I was
seated behind a desk examining papers, armed partisans ranged behind
me. Kelley, in accordance with his clerical costume, had left his gun
in a corner.</p>

<p>	"Gentlemen, this
is father Kelley from Ireland." Kelley smiled and nodded
unctuously.</p>

<p>	I studied a file in
front of me, drumming my fingers on the desk. I looked up.</p>

<p>	"Father Gomez?"</p>

<p>	"I am Father
Gomez." A plump face, near-sighted yellowish eyes behind
spectacles, a cruel absentminded expression.</p>

<p>	"Father Domingo?"</p>

<p>	"I am Father
Domingo." A thin sour face, autos-da-fé smoldering in
sulfurous gray eyes.</p>

<p>	"You are officers
of the Inquisition?" I inquired midly.</p>

<p>	"We are
clergymen. Priests of God," said Domingo, glaring at me. He was
not used to being on the receiving end.</p>

<p>	"You are dogs of
the Inquisition. Sent here from Lima. You urged that our companion
Captain Strobe be burned as a heretic instead of hanged as a pirate.
You were overruled by Bishop Gardenas and Father Herera. No doubt you
are biding your time to revenge yourself on these honest men for
their humanity."</p>

<p>	Without more ado I
drew my double-barreled pistol and shot them both in the stomach.
Placing the smoking pistol on the desk, I snapped my fingers.</p>

<p>	"Father Kelley!
Extreme unction!"</p>

<p>	The other clergymen
gasped and turned pale. However, they could not conceal their relief
when I told then that as decent clergymen they had nothing to fear. I
reloaded my pistol as Kelley delivered his bogus unction.</p>

<p>	"Well, I think
you gentlemen could do with a drink." I poured for each a small
glass of anise spirits containing four grains of opium.</p><empty-line /><p>Sitting on a balcony
overlooking the bay, sipping a rum punch as the sun went down, I
reflected that the exercise of power conveys a weird sensation of
ease and tranquility. (I wonder how many of the ten men in the
guardhouse will be alive tomorrow. It amuses me to think of them
cutting each other's throats over a bottle of poisoned spirits.)</p>

<p>	The
summary dispatching of the two Inquisitors was based on a precept
long used by the Inquisition itself, which is in fact the way they
were able to maintain their power despite widespread opposition and
hatred. Brutal sanctions against a minority from which one is
generically exempt cannot but produce a measure of satisfaction in
those who are spared such treatment. "As decent clergymen you
have nothing to fear." Thus the burning of Jews, Moors, and
sodomites produces a certain sense of comfort in those who are not
Jews, Moors, or sodomites: <emphasis>"This won't happen to me."</emphasis>
To turn this mechanism back on the Inquisitors themselves gives me a
feeling of taking over the office of fate. I am become the bad karma
of the Inquisition. I am allowing myself also the satisfaction that
derives from a measure of hypocrisy, rather like the slow digestion
of a good meal.</p><empty-line /><p><emphasis>Troublemakers:</emphasis></p>

<p>Any body of men will be
found to contain ten to fifteen percent of incorrigible
troublemakers. In fact, most of the misery on this planet derives
from this ten percent. It is useless to try and reeducate them, since
their only function is to harm and harass others. To maintain them in
prisons is a waste of personnel and provisions. To addict them to
opium takes too long, and in any case they are not amenable to useful
work. There is but one sure remedy. In future operations, as soon as
these individuals are discovered, either by advance intelligence or
by on-the-spot observation, they will be killed on any pretext. In
the words of the Bard, "Only fools do those villians pity who
are punished ere they have done their mischief."</p><empty-line /><p>Today Hans is the City
Commandante: all spit and polish, bathed and shaved, green-jacketed
with silver skull-and-crossbones on his shoulders, khaki pants, his
soft brown boots carefully shined.</p>

<p>	At the guardhouse,
five of the prisoners are dead. It is easy to reconstruct what
happened. Sergeant Gonzalez, attempting to keep all the liquor for
himself, was attacked by Corporal Hassanavitch and an accomplice. The
sergeant killed them both with his knife and then drained about half
the spirits, holding the rest at bay. The sergeant soon being
overcome, the others took the knife and cut his throat. The victors
then drank the remains of the bottle, which killed three of them.</p>

<p>	"Well, get them
out of here." Hans gestures to the corpses.</p>

<p>	The partisans lead the
way, planting shovels in the ground. We leave the prisoners digging
graves like sullen Calibans and proceed to the barracks, where we are
greeted by the smell of cannabis. The soldiers are laughing and
talking, more relaxed now that ten wrong men have been removed.</p>

<p>	<emphasis>"Achtung!"</emphasis></p>

<p>	The way Hans can say
it anyone would believe it.</p>

<p>	The men are now
brought to the wardroom one at a time. The hawk-faced youth, whose
name is Rodriguez, acts as clerk, writing down answers as Hans fires
the questions.</p>

<p>	"Name? Age? Place
of birth? Length of service? Locations and times of previous service?
What training have you received as a soldier?"</p>

<p>	"Training?"
The man looks blank.</p>

<p>	"What did you do
all day?"</p>

<p>	"Well, we had to
drill and clean the barracks, cook and wash dishes, work in the
Captain's gardens...."</p>

<p>	"What about your
guns? You received instruction in their use? There was daily target
practice?"</p>

<p>	"We fired them
only at fiestas and parades."</p>

<p>	"Was there
instruction in knife and sword fighting? In unarmed combat?"</p>

<p>	"No, nothing like
that. We could get a citation for fighting."</p>

<p>	"Field
exercises?"</p>

<p>	<emphasis>"Qué
es eso?"</emphasis></p>

<p>	"That
means you go into jungles or mountains to learn the terrain and
pretend to fight a war."</p>

<p>	"We never left
the city."</p>

<p>	"So you have no
idea of conditions and terrain ten miles outside Panama City?"</p>

<p>	"No, sir."</p>

<p>	"During the time
of your service here, have you been sick?"</p>

<p>	"Various
times, <emphasis>señor</emphasis>."</p>

<p>	"And what
sicknesses have you had?"</p>

<p>	"Well, sir,
chills and fever, cramps and loose bowels...."</p>

<p>	"Pox?"</p>

<p>	"Yes, sir. The
whores are rotten with it."</p>

<p>	"And what
treatment did you receive?"</p>

<p>	"Not much. The
doctor gave me some pills for the pox that made me feel worse. There
was a sort of tea for the fever that helped a little...."</p>

<p>	"You were
formerly stations at Cartagena. What was the situation there as
regards sickness?"</p>

<p>	"Much worse, sir.
A thousand soldiers died of the yellow sickness. That was when I was
transferred."</p>

<p>	"Was the work
there the same?"</p>

<p>	"More or less,
except we had to guard the mule train."</p>

<p>	"So you did leave
the city at times?"</p>

<p>	"Yes, sir.
Sometimes for a week."</p>

<p>	"And what was the
mule train carrying? You don't need to tell me. Gold. What else
interests the Spanish? Well now, all that gold to protect ... the
garrison must have been larger than here ... perhaps a thousand?"</p>

<p>	"Ten thousand,
sir," says the soldier proudly.</p>

<p>	Hans pretends to be
impressed and whistles softly.</p>

<p>	"And
galleons no doubt to take away the gold? When all those sailors came
ashore there must have been some right brawls in Cartagena, <emphasis>verdad</emphasis>?"</p>

<p>	<emphasis>"Verdad,
señor."</emphasis></p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>Big Picture calling
Shifty</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>We return to staff
headquarters, which we have set up in the Governor's spacious bedroom
on the ground floor. This is the coolest room in the house but even
so the heat is oppressive and we must keep the windows covered with
mosquito netting which cuts off the occasional eddy of air that is
the closest approximation to a breeze. There is a huge ornate
curtained bed where exhausted partisans who arrive with dispatches
can rest, where the staff officers can catch an hour's sleep or
satisfy the sudden sex hungers that occur during the long hours of
intense mental concentration without sleep.</p>

<p>	We often work naked in
the Governor's bedroom, seeing the maps with our whole bodies,
performing ritual copulations in front of the maps, animating the
maps with our sperm. The key map is Big Picture, showing the present
area of occupation from Cartagena on the Atlantic seaboard to the
Pearl Islands in the Pacific and northwards to a point a hundred
miles north of Panama City. Green pins on the map show cities
occupied by the partisans. Black pins designate areas occupied by the
Spanish.</p>

<p>	The key to Big Picture
are ledger books.... We are now transcribing into the ledger books
information obtained from the prisoners.</p>

<p>	Cartagena.
Location on map. Black pin. Estimated
strength of garrison: ten thousand soldiers. Strongly fortified. Has
resisted a number of pirate attacks. Gold terminal. Heavily armed
convoys pick up gold here. Hygienic conditions worse than Panama.
Recent epidemic of yellow fever.</p>

<p>	These ledgers indicate
no only the strength of garrisons and the movement of ships, but also
the whole way of life of the enemy, what the soldiers do, what the
officers do, what food they eat, what illnesses they suffer from, how
they think, and what they can be expected to do. Rather like studying
past performance to pick the winner of a horse race. But the Spanish,
since they consist entirely of past performance, are much more
predictable than horses. Massively encased in their colonial
architecture, their forts and galleons, their uniforms, gold,
portraits and religious processions, they move like ponderous armored
knights to ends the was can predetermine.</p>

<p>	In addition to Big
Picture, there are also much more detailed maps of smaller areas
showing locations of arms caches, farmhouses belonging to partisans,
streams, wells, and sketches of animals native to the region. As
messages come in, the green pins are spreading north and east and
south along the Pacific coast. The whole southern isthmus of Panama
is now in our hands.</p>

<p>	We study the maps,
concentrating on Big Picture. What exactly will the Spanish do? No
doubt respond after their kind—heavy, massive, and slow as
their galleons. They will dispatch galleons from Cartagena to land
troops on the east coast, who will then move west towards Panama
City. They will dispatch galleons from Lima to the Bay of Panama to
land troops above and below Panama City, in what they fondly think is
a crushing pincer movement.</p>

<p>	On
the eastern seaboard, we have every chance of a decisive sea victory.
Here we have <emphasis>The Siren</emphasis> and <emphasis>The Great White</emphasis>, both now
equipped with maneuverable cannons and exploding projectiles. No
doubt all the British and French pirates and privateers in the West
Indian area will gather like sharks at the smell of Cartagena gold.
Our Destroyers will be operating long the coasts and land partisans
will make the landing of troops extremely costly. On the Pacific
side, our sea forces are negligible, consisting of only a few
Destroyers in the Pearl Islands vicinity. We have, therefore, decided
to evacuate Panama City at the approach of the Spanish galleons and
let them land as many troops as they wish. In fact, the more they
land, the better we like it. The Spanish, confident of victory, will
then move north and south relying on heavy reinforcements from the
east.</p><empty-line /><p>Back in the barracks,
the fifteen who are to receive partisan training are lined up. I
study each fact in turn: Rodriguez, the haw-faced boy with intense
gray eyes, very intelligent, highly literate staff-officer material
... Juanito, a little Filipino, always smiling, eager to please ...
the mulatto reader José, a solid reliable face, steady nerves
in combat ... Kiki, the half-reader with a Mongoloid face and
straight black hair, nicknamed El Chino ... Paco with his impudent
ingratiating smile ... Nemo, a slender yellow-skinned buck-toothed
youth with a dancer's grace ... Nimun, a curiously archaic youth part
Negro with red hair, brown freckles, and a blank expression—he
looks like one of the first mutant redheads from prehistoric times
... Pedro, a handsome broad-faced boy with high cheekbones and a
smooth reddish face. The others are less distinguished, country faces
from farm families who have enlisted to escape grinding poverty.</p>

<p>	"You have been
selected for partisan training. Your instruction begins tomorrow.
During ten days of training, you will be paid five times your present
pay. As soon as you join partisans in the field, the rate will be ten
times present pay and an equal share of any booty taken. You will be
wearing cadet uniforms from now on. You can come and go as you like
after training hours."</p>

<p>	Hans walks up and down
measuring the boys with his eyes and writing measurements down on a
clipboard. He hands the list to partisans, who return with a stack of
uniforms and boots which they dump on a table.</p>

<p>	We direct the boys to
strip and bathe.</p>

<p>	The
boys are drawing water from the cistern and pouring it over each
other with the usual horseplay and merriment. Paco sidles in behind
Nemo and pretends to fuck him, rolling his eyes and showing his teeth
and snorting like a horse.<emphasis> "Cabrón!"</emphasis> Nemo
screams, dodging away as he empties a bucket of water over Paco's
head.</p>

<p>	I am the eternal
spectator, separated by unbridgeable gaps of knowledge, feeling the
sperm gathering in tight nuts, the quivering rectums, smelling the
iron reek of sex, sweat, and rectal mucus, watching the writhing
brown bodies in the setting sun, torn with an ache of disembodied
lust and the searing pain of disintegration.</p>

<p>	Silver spots boil in
front of my eyes. I am standing in the empty ruined courtyard
hundreds of years from now, a sad ghostly visitant in a dead city,
smell of nothing and nobody there.</p>

<p>	The
boys are flickering shadows of memory, evoking bodies that have long
since turned to dust. I am calling, calling with a throat, without a
tongue, calling across the centuries: <emphasis>"Paco ... Joselito ...
Enrique."</emphasis></p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>Screen play/part one</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>It is on the second
floor. A brass plaque: "Blum &amp; Krup." A metal door. A
bell. I ring. A cold-eyed young Jew opens the door a crack.</p>

<p>	"Yes? You are
client of salesman?"</p>

<p>	"Neither." I
hand him my card. He closes the door and goes away. He comes back.</p>

<p>	"Mr. Blum and Mr.

<p>	He ushers me into an
office decorated in the worst German taste with pictures of youths
and maidens swimming with swans in northern lakes, the carpets up to
my ankles. There, behind a huge desk, are Blum and Krup. A vaudeville
team. Blum is Austrian and Jewish, Krup is Prussian and German.</p>

<p>	Krup
bows stiffly without getting up. "Krup
von Nordenholz."</p>

<p>	Blum
bustles out from behind the desk. "Sit down, Mr. Snide. I am the
master here. Have a cigar."</p>

<p>	"No, thanks."</p>

<p>	"Well, we will
have some fun at least. We will have an orgy." He goes back to
his chair on the other side of the desk and sits there watching me
through cigar smoke.</p>

<p>	"And why have you
not come here sooner, Mr. Snide?" asks Krup in a cold dry voice.</p>

<p>	"Oh well, there's
a lot of legalwork in this business ..." I say vaguely.</p>

<p>	<emphasis>"Ja
und Assenwerke."</emphasis> (Yes and
asswork.)</p>

<p>	"We want that you
stop with the monkey business and do some real business, Mr. Snide."</p>

<p>	"We are not a
charitable institution."</p>

<p>	"We do not
finance ass fuckings."</p>

<p>	"Now just a
minute, Blum and Krup. I wasn't aware you were my clients."</p>

<p>	Krup emits a short
cold bray of laughter.</p>

<p>	Blum takes the cigar
out of his mouth and points the butt across the table at my chest.
"And who did you think was your million-dollar client?"</p>

<p>	"A green bitch
synthesized from cabbage?"</p>

<p>	"Well, if you are
my client, what am I expected to do exactly?"</p>

<p>	Krup whinnies like a
cynical horse.</p>

<p>	"You are to
recover certain rare books now in the possession of a certain
Countess," Blum says.</p>

<p>	"I am not even
sure I would know these books if I saw them."</p>

<p>	"You have seen
samples."</p>

<p>	"I am not sure
the samples correspond in any way to the alleged books I am retained
to recover."</p>

<p>	"You think you
have been deceived?"</p>

<p>	"Not
'think.' <emphasis>Know</emphasis>."</p>

<p>	The room is so quiet
you can hear the long gray cone of Blum's cigar fall into an ashtray.
Finally he speaks. "And suppose we could tell you exactly where
the books are?"</p>

<p>	"So they are in
someone's private bank vault surrounded by guards and computerized
alarm systems? I am supposed to sneak in there and carry out a carton
of books slung over my shoulder in a rare tapestry, stamps and first
editions in all my pockets, industrial diamonds up my ass in a finger
stall, a sapphire big as a hen's egg in my mouth? Is that what I am
expected to do?"</p>

<p>	Blum laughs loud and
long while Krup looks sourly at his nails. "No, Mr. Snide. This
is not what you are expected to do. There is a group of well-armed
partisans operating in an adjacent area, who will occupy the
Countess's stronghold. You will have only to go in after them and
secure the books. There will be an outcry against the partisans who
have so savagely butchered a rich foreign sow... Then stories will
filter out about the Countess and her laboratories, and there'll be
something in it for everybody. The CIA, the partisans, the Russians,
the Chinese ... we will have some fun at least. Might start a little
Vietnam down here."</p>

<p>	"Well," I
say. "You have to take a broad general view of things."</p>

<p>	"We prefer a very
specific view, Mr. Snide," says Krup looking at a heavy gold
pocket watch. "Be here at this time Thursday and we will talk
further. Meanwhile, I would strongly advise you to avoid further
commitments."</p>

<p>	"And bring your
assistants and the books what you got," adds Blum.</p><empty-line /><p>When Jim and I go to
see Blum and Krup on Thursday, we take along the books the Iguanas
have given me. Krup looks the books over, snorting from time to time,
and as he finishes leafing through each one, he slides it down the
table to Blum.</p>

<p>	"Mr. Snide, where
are the books you are now making?" asks Krup.</p>

<p>	"Books? Me? I'm
just a private eye, not a writer."</p>

<p>	"You
come to make with us the crookery," snaps Blum, "we break
you in your neck. Hans! Willi! Rudi! Heinrich! <emphasis>Herein!</emphasis>"</p>

<p>	Four characters come
in with silenced P-38s, like in an old Gestapo movie.</p>

<p>	"And
now, your assistant will get the books while you and your <emphasis>Lustknabe</emphasis>
remain here. Hans and Heinrich will go with him to make sure he does
not so lose himself."</p>

<p>	Hans and Heinrich step
behind Jim. "Keep six feet in front us at all times." They
file out.</p>

<p>	In half an hour Jim is
back with the books. B &amp; K spread them out on the table and both
of them stand up and look at them like generals studying a battle
plan.</p>

<p>	Finally
Krup nods. "<emphasis>Ach ja</emphasis>. With these I think it is enough."</p>

<p>	Blum
turns to me, almost jovial now, rubbing his hands. "Well, you
and your assistant and the boy, you are ready to leave, <emphasis>hein</emphasis>?"</p>

<p>	"Leave? Where
to?"</p>

<p>	"That you will
see."</p>

<p>	Hans, Rudi, Willi and
Heinrich march us up some stairs onto a roof and into a waiting
helicopter. The pilot has a blank cold thuggish face and he is
wearing a 45 in a shoulder holster. He looks American. The guards
strap us into our seats and blindfold us and we take off. The flight
lasts for about an hour.</p>

<p>	Then we are herded out
and into another place, a prop job. Dakota, probably. About three
hours this time, and we set down on water. They take off our
blindfolds and we now have a different pilot. He looks English and
has a beard.</p>

<p>	The pilot turns around
and smiles. "Well, chaps, here we are."</p>

<p>	They untie us and we
get out on a jetty. It is on a small lake, just big enough to set the
plane down. Around the lake I see Quonset huts and in an open space
something that looks like an oil rig. A barbed-wire fence surrounds
the area with gun towers. There are enough armed guards around for a
small army.</p>

<p>	In front of a Quonset
hut several men are talking. One comes forward to greet us: it is
that CIA punk Pierson.</p>

<p>	"Well, Snide,"
he says. "Welcome aboard."</p>

<p>	"Well, Pierson,"
I say. "If you can't lick them join them."</p>

<p>	"That's right.
How about some chow?"</p>

<p>	"That would be
just fine."</p>

<p>	He leads the way into
a Quonset that serves as a dining room. There are some long tables
and tin plates and a number of men eating. Some of them look like
construction workers, others like technicians.</p>

<p>	My attention is drawn
to a table of about thirty youths. They are the best-looking boys I
have ever seen at one time, and all of them are ideal specimens of
white Anglo-Saxon youth.</p>

<p>	"Our genetic
pool," Pierson explains.</p>

<p>	A fat mess sergeant
slops some fish and rice and stewed apricots on our plates and fills
tin cups with cold tea.</p>

<p>	"Army-style
here," says Pierson.</p>

<p>	After we finish
eating, he lights a cigarette and grins at me through the smoke.</p>

<p>	"Well, I guess
you are wondering what this is all about."</p>

<p>	"Yeah."</p>

<p>	"Come along to my
digs and I'll explain. Some of it, at least."</p>

<p>	I know quite a bit
already. Much more than I want him to think I know. And I know that
the less he tells me the better chance I have of getting out of here
alive. I've already seen that the oil rig is a rocket-launching pad.
Things are falling into place.</p>

<p>	He leads the way to a
small prefab. He turns to Jim and Kiki: "Why don't you two look
around? Do some fishing. You can get tackle at the PX. The lake is
stocked with largemouth bass ... You'll do well here...."</p>

<p>	I nod to Jim and he
walks away with Kiki. Pierson unlocks the door and we go in. A cot, a
card table, some chairs, a few books. He motions me to a chair, sits
down and looks at me. "You saw the launching pad?"</p>

<p>	"Yes."</p>

<p>	"And what do you
think it will be used for?"</p>

<p>	"To launch
something, obviously."</p>

<p>	"Obviously. A
space capsule that will also be a communications satellite."</p>

<p>	I am beginning to
understand what they are planning to communicate.</p>

<p>	"Now, just
suppose an atom bomb should fall on New York City. Who would get the
blame for that?"</p>

<p>	"The Commies."</p>

<p>	"Right. And
suppose a mysterious plague broke out attacking the white race, while
the yellow, black, and brown seemed to be mysteriously immune? Who
would be blamed for that?"</p>

<p>	"Yellow black
brown. Yellow especially."</p>

<p>	"Right. So we
would then be justified in using any biologic and/or chemical weapon
in retaliations, would we not?"</p>

<p>	"You would do it
justified or not. But the plague might well decimate the white race
... destroy them as a genetic entity."</p>

<p>	"We would have
the fever sperm stocks. We could rebuild the white race to our
specifications, after we ..."</p>

<p>	The table of thirty
boys flashed in front of my eyes. "Pretty neat. And you want me
to write the scenario."</p>

<p>	"That's it.
You've written enough already to get the ball rolling."</p>

<p>	"What about the
Countess de Gulpa? How does she figure in this?"</p>

<p>	"Ah, the
Countess. She doesn't figure. She is not nearly as important as you
may have thought. She would hardly go along with destroying the
blacks and browns, because she makes her money out of them. She still
thinks in terms of money."</p>

<p>	"Her
laboratories?"</p>

<p>	"Not much we
could use. Certain lines of specialized experimentation ...
interesting, perhaps. She has, for example, succeeded in reanimating
headless men. These she gives to her friends as love slaves. They are
fed through the rectum. I don't see any practical applications. We
had thought of using her in scandals to discredit the rank-and-file
CIA ... but that won't be necessary now.</p>

<p>	"I daresay you
could wipe her out with rockets from here."</p>

<p>	"Easily. Or we
could use biologic weapons."</p><empty-line /><p>	"The Black Fever?"</p>

<p>	"Yes." He
pointed to the radio. "In fact, I could give the order right
now."</p>

<p>	"So what do you
want from me?"</p>

<p>	"You will finish
the scenario. Your assistant will do the illustrations."</p>

<p>	"And then?"</p>

<p>	"You have been
promised a million dollars to find the books. You have found them. Of
course, money will mean nothing once this thing breaks, but we will
see to it that you live comfortably. After all, we have no motive to
eliminate you ... we may need your services in the future. We're not
bad guys really...."</p><empty-line /><p>How nice will these
guys be once they get what they want from me? If I am allowed to live
at all it will certainly be as a prisoner.</p>

<p>	I
am trying to stall Blum with a slick number called <emphasis>Naked Newgate</emphasis>
about a handsome young highwayman and the sheriff's daughter. Blum
isn't buying it.</p>

<p>	"Any
thousand-dollar-a-week Hollywood hack could write such a piece of
shit."</p>

<p>	Then Pierson asks me
over for a drink and a "little chat." It sound ominous.</p>

<p>	"Oh uh by the way
... Blum isn't exactly happy about the screenplay."</p>

<p>	"Nize baby, et up
all the screenplay."</p>

<p>	He looks at me
sharply.</p>

<p>	"What's that,
Snide?"</p>

<p>	"It's a joke.
Fitzgerald in Hollywood."</p>

<p>	"Oh," he
says, a bit intimidated by the reference to Fitzgerald ... perhaps
something he should know about ... He clears his throat.</p>

<p>	"Blum
says he wants something he calls <emphasis>art</emphasis>. He knows it when he sees
it and he isn't seeing it now."</p>

<p>	"What
I like is <emphasis>culture</emphasis>! What I like is <emphasis>art</emphasis>!" I screech
in the tones of a crazed Jewish matron.</p>

<p>	He gives me a long
blank sour look.</p>

<p>	"More jokes,
Snide?"</p>

<p>	"I'll
give him what he wants. I'm staging a little theater production
tomorrow ... <emphasis>very artistic</emphasis>."</p>

<p>	"This had better
be good, Snide."</p><empty-line /><p>A slim blond youth in
elegant nineteenth-century clothes stands on a scaffold. A black
hood, laced with gold threads, is drawn over his head.</p><empty-line /><p>RUBBLE BLOOD PU</p>

<p>(END OF PART I)</p><empty-line /><p>Stuck in dead smallpox
nights of last century. This satined ass in yellow light.</p>

<p>	(Yellow-flecked storm
waves ... palm trees ... wide strip of sand ... a corduroy road ... I
don't remember hitting ... I really don't think so ... the truck
shadow ... trees tasting cement ... green dark water.)</p>

<p>	"Good English
soldier of fortune, sir. Work for you, yes no?"</p>

<p>	Spelling years whisper
the lake heavy red sweater, trash cans in yellow light. The sigh of
harmonica flags in the sad golden wash of the sunset singing fish
luminous sky fresh smell of damp violets. Man smell of dirty clothes
red faces breath thick on tarnished mirrors.</p>

<p>	Sunset, train
whistles. I am on the train with Waring. Red clay roads and flint
chips glitter in the setting sun.</p>

<p>	Pilots the plane
across time into a waiting taxi, steep stone street, boy with
erection yellow pimples turn-of-the-century lips parted ... red hair
freckles a ladder.</p>

<p>	A young face floats in
front of his eyes. The lips, twisted in a smile of ambiguous sexual
invitation, move in silent words that stir and ache in his throat
with a taste of blood and metallic sweetness. He feels the dizzy
death weakness breathing through his teeth, his breath ice cold.</p>

<p>	The boy in front of
him lights up inside, a blaze of light out at his eyes in a flash as
Audrey feels the floor drop out from under him. He is falling, the
face floating down with him, then a blinding flash blots out the room
and the waiting faces.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>Cheers here are the
nondead</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>A tenor voice was
singing in my head:</p><empty-line /><p>"A touch of sun, a
touch of sun</p>

<p>The color sergeant said
..."</p><empty-line /><p>I woke up with
something cold on my chest. A doctor was sitting by my bed with a
stethoscope.</p>

<p>	"Hello there,
young guy," he said when I opened my eyes.</p>

<p>	A naval officer stood
beside the doctor, looking down at me. I could feel a cast around my
neck. The doctor turned to the other officer:</p>

<p>	"Heart's sound as
a gold dollar. Should be out of the cast in a week."</p>

<p>	The officer looked
down at me from some stinker of a battleship film: "If you feel
like that again, son, so see the shrink or the chaplain."</p>

<p>	"Would someone
show me my face in the mirror?"</p>

<p>	The doctor held a hand
mirror in front of me. A shock of recognition. Familiar young face.
Red hair.</p>

<p>	"Just wanted to
be sure I was still there."</p>

<p>	The doctor and the
officer laughed, and I heard the door close. The face looked at me
from the foot of the bed.</p>

<p>	"Hello. I'm Jimmy
Lee. You're Jerry. We're identical twins. I'm in the medics, you're
in communications. U.S. Navy, six years' service. Depressed over the
death of your pet monkey, you tried to hang yourself. I cut you down
in time. That's our story. You want to remember...."</p><empty-line /><p>They had to be careful
about sex in the navy, so Jimmy and Jerry got a book on astral
projection and decided to learn to do it in the "second state,"
as the book called it, and they finally succeeded though they never
knew exactly when it would happen or who was going to visit whom
until it happened and this was sometimes under embarrassing
circumstances, like in the shower room or during a physical
examination. One twin lets out an eerie high-pitched wolf howl and
turns bright red all over as the hairs on his head and body stand up
and crackle. Then, as if struck by lightning, he falls to the floor
in an erotic seizure ejaculating repeatedly in front of the appalled
and salacious tars. A slack-jawed pimply boy from east Texas watches
with a bestial leer.</p>

<p>	"Look
at his <emphasis>peter</emphasis>!"</p>

<p>	<emphasis>"Medics!"</emphasis></p>

<p>	Jimmy describes a
typical attack to a flustered navy psychiatrist:</p>

<p>	"First
there's this <emphasis>smell</emphasis>, Doctor. Like skunks in heat, if you'll
pardon the expression, sir. It chokes you and gets you hot. Like a
<emphasis>popper</emphasis>, sir." He makes a motion of breaking a popper
under his nose, moans and shows his teeth. The doctor coughs, opens a
window and pulls up a venetian blind. Sunlight streams into the room.</p>

<p>	"And then Jerry's
face comes into focus like. He he he," he titters. "That
reminds me of a joke, sir. This old Jew, sir, got his wife and Mrs.
Lieberman from next door in his car, he is driving out into the
country to focus his headlights, sir, and he's got a sheet to do it
with and Mrs. Lieberman sees him getting the sheet out, sir, and she
says:</p>

<p>	" 'Vot's he gonna
do?'</p>

<p>	" 'He's going to
focus.'</p>

<p>	"
<emphasis>'Vot? Both of us?'</emphasis></p>

<p>	"Rather
good, don't you think, sir? Looking at me with this <emphasis>smile</emphasis>,
sir." He leers at the doctor and squirms in his chair. "And
his body, sir, is a <emphasis>translucent</emphasis> red haze. I got that word out
of a navy bulletin on poison fish. Some of them is <emphasis>translucents</emphasis>.
You can see all their <emphasis>guts</emphasis>, sir." He looked pointedly at
the doctor's stomach. "It's like Jerry <emphasis>vaporize</emphasis> hisself.
He just <emphasis>steams</emphasis> right into me feeling and wriggling down into
each glittering leg hair, sir." Jimmy hitches up his pants to
show white ankles with red hairs that stir and glitter in the
sunlight.</p>

<p>	"With
little electric <emphasis>prickles</emphasis>, sir, into you know and you know and
you knows. Then I am going down very fast in an elevator, you knows
the feeling, sir, right here." He cups his crotch. "And
Jerry is floating down with me. Then silver light <emphasis>pops</emphasis> in my
eyes, sir." He makes a loud popping sound with his mouth. The
doctor starts. "And I shoot off and everything turns red. We
call it a <emphasis>red-out</emphasis>, sir."</p>

<p>	The doctor made a
personal diagnosis of acute homosexual panic. A colleague said it was
psychomotor epilepsy. The Old Man said he didn't care what it was, he
didn't want it in the navy. So the Juicy-Fruit twins, as he called
them, were up for discharge. Since they had no medical record of
epileptic seizures or psychosis prior to enlisting in the navy there
was the question of a complete disability pension, and this slowed
things down. Then project Simulated Space Conditions got under way
and the discharge was shelved.</p><empty-line /><p>"What's going on
here?" I asked Jimmy Lee.</p>

<p>	"Well, we're on
Krup's spaceship or so he claims. Anyhoo, he's up there with charts
and maps and the crew seems to obey him, most of them at least."</p>

<p>	"What do they
look like?"</p>

<p>	"Germans mostly.
Young punks."</p>

<p>	"Who else is
here?"</p>

<p>	"All the boys
from your scripts: Audrey, Jerry, all the Jims and Johns and Alis and
Kikis and Strobe, Kelley, and Dahlfar. One foot in a navy mess and
the other on some kooky spaceship. You see, there is a pretense this
is just a naval station and you never know which is the pretense:
spaceship or navy. One minute you are getting popped in Tamaghis, the
next you're on KP or swabbing the deck. They got shore patrols out in
Tamaghis. Whole area is off limits. And pro stations. And I've got a
rundown on Krup. He's an intergalactically known spaceship swindler.
You set out for the Big Dipper and wind up stranded in Vladivosotok.
And he's a heavy metal junk runner, known as Opium Jones in the
trade."</p>

<p>	I'd seen metal junk
addicts. Withdrawal is like acute radiation sickness. We sure are in
good hands.</p>

<p>	"Who's that joker
with the doctor?"</p>

<p>	"Oh he's one of
the old navy set.... The doctor will be back any minute. I have to
take a sperm specimen. They run tests on it...."</p>

<p>	I start to get a
hard-on at the prospect of coming in another body. The doctor is
looking down at me.</p>

<p>	"How do you feel,
young guy?"</p>

<p>	"Horny, Doc."</p>

<p>	"That always
happens with a vertebral fracture like yours."</p>

<p>	He folds the sheet
down to my knees. I can it float up and throb. A throbbing in my neck
sends electric tingles down to my crotch. Jimmy sits down with a
beaker and runs his fingers lightly up and down my new cock and I go
off in a blaze of silver light. Jimmy's face gets black around the
edges and I go out for a few seconds. When I come around, the doctor
is gone.</p>

<p>	"He's a creep and
I hate him," Jimmy says. "He used to be the doctor in a
Siren cathouse."</p>

<p>	I know what that
means. Money from the Madam to pass her girls, in advanced stages of
one of the fifty-seven venereal diseases endemic in the Cities of the
Red Night,</p>

<p>	"Sometimes I wish
it was one thing or the other. Tamaghis or the navy," I
complain. "Six years in the navy and what did it get us? Give me
Tamaghis. It beats swabbing decks and fucking clapper dry-cunt
whores."</p>

<p>	"It does at
that," agrees Jimmy.</p>

<p>	"What about
Blum?"</p>

<p>	"It's open war
now between Krup and Hollywood."</p>

<p>	"Sounds like a
scriptwriter's paradise."</p>

<p>	"It is and that's
why they drafted you into the navy where they don't have to pay you
anything but navy pay. Got you for a pop. Same way they got all of
us."</p>

<p>	"So this ship is
manned by the hanged."</p>

<p>	"Sure. That's how
we all got shanghaied."</p>

<p>	"The Germans
too?"</p>

<p>	"Second
generation. They are all artificial-insemination kids from one hanged
father."</p>

<p>	I closed my eyes,
feeling very relaxed and comfortable in Jimmy's body, and I could
remember the little Michigan lake town. Fishing was the big thing
then, carp and lake trout. At fourteen I ran away to join the navy
with a forged birth certificate. Two years later they found it out
and the President himself pardoned me—it was in all the papers.
And I could remember this dream I kept having about a strange city
with red light in the streets and then I was in a room naked and
could see other people there naked too and suddenly they are all
looking at me, I get a hard-on and go off and sometimes one of the
faces lights up just as I start to shoot. And that was the first time
I saw Jimmy Lee, long before I met him in the navy after my pardon. I
was learning to be  a radio operator and I'd gone to the radio room
when this new kid with tech stripes looks up and smiles at me just
like he did in the dream.</p>

<p>	"We met—in
a way, that is ... weren't you in the Double G the other night?"</p>

<p>	I remembered a place
I'd wandered into where everybody was looking at something I couldn't
see. The way they were looking and a smell in the place got me hot
and Jimmy looking at me like that, I was getting a hard-on now so I
sat down to hide it and lit a cigarette.</p>

<p>	Jimmy starts filling
me in on the officers. He always knew who was what aboard ship. "The
Old Man's a real asshole and you can't smear it on too thick—tell
him you want to be buried right in the same coffin with him when you
die. Anyhoo, I think we're getting a new C.O. You see, this is a kook
project with simulated space conditions and the old C.O. can't
adjust. So they have called in someone called Krup von Nordenholz, a
Nazi war criminal, I hear, but a space expert. So forget about the
old C.O. Never butter a man on the way out or you can slip right out
with him. Like to bunk with me? Just one other kid in the room, Jim
Lewis. You'll like him and he'll like you, too...."</p><empty-line /><p>The investiture of the
new C.O. was not unopposed and a period of chaos followed.</p>

<p>	Stepping into the
hall, I saw three naked boys swabbing the corridor, wriggling their
asses and goosing each other. The old C.O., with the master-at-arms,
bustles round a corner.</p>

<p>	"This is
disgraceful! Arrest these men!"</p>

<p>	"Are we going to
be popped, Commander?"</p>

<p>	"Bare-ass in
front of all our mates?"</p>

<p>	"These men are
obviously deranged. Call the medics. Reefer madness most likely. If
it's dope they are to be transferred to the prison ward."</p>

<p>	The doctor minces in.
"Hello there, young guys. Come along for an examination."</p>

<p>	"Who's
<emphasis>that</emphasis>?"</p>

<p>	"That's the new
doctor."</p>

<p>	"Well, I don't
like the look of him."</p>

<p>	"He's supposed to
be an expert on space medicine."</p>

<p>	"So what?"</p>

<p>	"So long as I'm
C.O. this is Naval Station 123 Communications."</p>

<p>	Back in his cabin, the
C.O. found a full-length naked effigy of himself dangling with a
hard-on from a lantern hook in the ceiling. Then a powder charge went
off in its nuts and a roll of paper popped out the cock in a puff of
smoke. The paper landed on his desk and unrolled: his resignation
just waiting for his signature.</p>

<p>	The
resignation of the old C.O. after a nervous breakdown did not end the
conflict. The old navy was still in occupation. But Krup was winning.
Smoothly Krup moved in his Hitler <emphasis>Jungen</emphasis> boys, one looking
just like another, all with rosy cheeks and yellow hair. These boys
were clean, efficient, exemplary sailors and the old navy could find
no fault with them. And Krup removed the off limits on Tamaghis. This
made him popular with the men. All the swishes in camouflage openly
wore Krup buttons: Billy Budd with a rope around his neck saying,
"God Bless Captain Krup."</p>

<p>	And the croaker was a
Krup man. He served on a Krup metal junk runner when the crew broke
into the cargo and got hooked on M.J. Krup found it out and cut them
off cold. "This is not a charitable institution," he told
the ward full of M.J. addicts shitting, screaming, puking,
ejaculating phosphorescent sperm. "I leave you in good hands."</p>

<p>	Anyone reporting sick
to that croaker walked out a Krup man or he went out feet-first. And
the fence sitters, seeing the way the navies were crumbling, began
coming over to Krup, and since many of these were the technical
sergeants, that just about sewed it up as a Krup shop.</p>

<p>	Then one night, the
Krup men in every dorm got up before dawn and took down all the pinup
girls. Oh say can you see by the dawn's early light forty-eight naked
boys fucking, sucking, rimming on a red, white, and blue gallows and
some awful Nordic shit Krup laps up like a cat, the boy singing his
swan song in a mountain lake full of swans who convoy him reverently
to the gallows. You don't have to be a space expert, just a tech
sergeant, to see the old navy game in operation—how one faction
gets another out to slide in their own boys.</p>

<p>	Morning sun on morning
hard-ons as the tars climb out of their bunks and stare at the walls.</p>

<p>	"Where's my
sexpot?" a boy moans stolidly.</p>

<p>	"I can't stand
these kids on my walls."</p>

<p>	"They're not your
walls any longer."</p>

<p>	"Hans,
Rudi, Heinrich, Willi—<emphasis>herein</emphasis>!"</p>

<p>	Come
in with Krup or else. A Krup takeover of the crew and the ship, or so
it seemed. He changed his the name of the ship from <emphasis>The Enterprise</emphasis>
to <emphasis>The Billy Celeste</emphasis>, after a nineteenth-century English
man-of-war. Now all Krup had to worry about were his own men, who had
used him to get rid of the old C.O., and the old navy with its
loathsome pinups and pro stations.</p>

<p>	But few of us had any
confidence in Krup. We'd seen this character operate, how smoothly
he'd hoaxed us into his hanging universe... Tamaghis ... the Double
G. But the shore leave was one hell of a lot better. We never had it
so good. We could go to a licensed Siren cathouse where they have
these deactivated Sirens just give you the sex trill.</p>

<p>	The boys are getting
dressed to go ashore, adjusting hangman-know ties.</p>

<p>	"Might pop myself
a month's pay tonight."</p>

<p>	"More likely
you'll swing the other way."</p>

<p>	The heavy-handed
kidding—it's all so Young Navy. The pimply virgin there trying
to act wise—he's from Virginia, so we call him the Virginian.
So we all chip in to pay for a Siren and watch the Virginian through
the two-way mirror....</p>

<p>	"Look
at the <emphasis>dong</emphasis> on that kid," says the boy from East Texas.</p>

<p>	The kraut kids hardly
ever go ashore, because they like to save money. Off duty they loll
around in their bunks jacking off and making airplane noises.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>The sky is thin as</p>

<p>paper here</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p><emphasis>Waring's
house still stands. Only the hinges have rusted away in the sea air
so all the doors are open. In a corner of the studio I find a scroll
about five feet wide wrapped in heavy brown paper on which is written
"For Noah." There is a wooden rod attached to one end of
the scroll and on the wall two brass sockets designed to receive it.
Standing on tiptoe I fit the rod into the sockets and a picture
unrolls. Click. I remember what Waring told me about the Old Man of
the Mountain and the magic garden that awaited his assassins after
their missions of death had been carried out. As I study the picture
I see an island in the sky, green as the heart of an emerald,
glittering with dew as waterfalls whip tattered banners of rainbow
around it. The shores are screened with thin poplars and cypress and
now I can see other islands stretching away into the distance like
the cloud cities of the Odor Eaters, which vanish in rain ... the
garden is fading ... rusty barges and derricks and cement mixers ...
a blue river ... red brick buildings ... dinner by the river. On the
edge of the market, tin ware clattering in a cold spring wind. When I
reach the house the roof has fallen in, rubble and sand on the floor,
weeds and vines growing through ... it must be centuries.... Only the
stairs remain going up into the blue sky. Sharp and clear as if seen
through a telescope, a boy in white workpants, black jacket and black
cap walking up a cracked street, ruined houses ahead. On the back of
his jacket is the word </emphasis>DINK<emphasis> in white thread. He stops, sitting
on a stone wall to eat a sandwich from his lunch box and drink some
orange liquid from a paper container. He is dangling his legs over a
dry streambed. He stands up in the weak sunlight and urinates into
the streambed, shaking a few drops off his penis like raindrops on
some purple plant. He buttons his pants and walks on.</emphasis></p>

<p><emphasis>	Dead leaves falling
as we drive out to the farmhouse in the buckboard ... loft of the old
barn, jagged slashes of blue sky where the boards have curled apart
... tattered banners of rain ... violet twilight yellow-gray around
the edges blowing away in the wind.</emphasis></p>

<p><emphasis>	He is sitting there
with me, cloud shadows moving across his face, ghostly smell of
flowers and damp earth ... florist shop by the vacant lot ... dim
dead boy.... The sky is thin as paper here.</emphasis></p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>Étranger
qui passait</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>Farnsworth, Ali, and
Noah Blake are moving south across the Red Desert, a vast area of
plateaus, canyons, and craters where sandstone mesas rise from the
red sand. The temperature is moderate even at midday and they travel
naked except for desert boots, packs, and belts with eighteen-inch
Bowie knives and ten-shot revolvers chambered for a high-speed
22-caliber cartridge. They have automatic carbines of the same
caliber in their packs, with thirty-shot clips. These weapons may be
needed if a time warp dumps an old western posse in their laps.</p>

<p>	The only provisions
they carry are protein, minerals and vitamins in a dry powder
concentrate. There are streams in the canyon bottoms where fish
abound and fruit and nut trees grow in profusion.</p>

<p>	They carry collapsible
hang-gliders in their packs.</p>

<p>	They have stopped at
the top of a thousand-foot cliff over an area littered with red
boulders. Here and there is a glint of water. The sandstone substrata
form pools that hold water and even in otherwise arid patches there
are usually fish and crustaceans in the pools.</p>

<p>	The boys unpack and
assemble the gliders. As always, they will take off one at a time so
that the lead glider will indicate to the others the air currents,
wind velocities, and updrafts to be expected.</p>

<p>	They draw lots. Noah
will go first. He stands on the edge of the cliff studying the
terrain, the movements of dust clouds and tumbleweeds. He looks up at
the clouds and the wheeling vultures. He runs towards the edge of the
cliff and soars out over the desert. The glider is out of control for
a few seconds in an updraft. He goes into a steep dive and pulls out,
coming in smoothly now he lands by a pool. He waves and signals to
the others; a tiny figure by a speck of water. They move a hundred
feet down the cliff and take off.</p>

<p>	By the pool they eat
dried fruit washed down with water. Ali stands up and points.</p>

<p>	"Look there."</p>

<p>	The others can't see
anything.</p>

<p>	"There ... right
there...."</p>

<p>	They pick out a lizard
about four feet high standing on two legs fifty feet way. The lizard
is speckled with orange-red and yellow blotches, so perfectly
camouflaged it is like picking a face out in a picture puzzle to see
him. The lizard knows he has been seen and lets out a high-pitched
whistle. He runs towards them on two legs with incredible speed,
kicking up a trail of red dust. He stops in front of them, immobile
as a stone, while the dust slowly settles behind him. Seen at close
range he is clearly humanoid with a smooth yellow face and a wide red
mouth, black eyes with red pupils, a patch of red pubic hair at the
crotch. A dry spoor smell drifts from his body.</p>

<p>	The lizard boy now
leads the way setting the fastest pace the others can maintain. As he
moves his body changes color to blend into the landscape. In the late
afternoon they are making their way down a steep path into a canyon.
Leaves spatter the lizard's body with green. They come to a wide
valley and a river with deep pools. The boys take off their packs and
swim in the cool water. The lizard dives down to the bottom and comes
up with fourteen-inch cutthroat trout in his jaws and flips it onto
the grass by the pool. Ali and Farnsworth are picking strawberries.</p>

<p>	Next day they set out
to explore the canyon. The river winds between red cliffs. Here and
there are cubicles cut in the rock by ancient cliff-dwellers.</p><empty-line /><p>We are heading for the
river towns of the fruit-fish people. The staple of their diet is a
fruit-eating fish which attains a weight of thirty pounds. To
cultivate this fish they plant the riverbanks with a variety of frit
trees and vines so that the smell of fruit and fruit blossoms
perfumes the air, which is a balmy eighty degrees.</p>

<p>	Our boat rides high in
the water on two pontoons of paper-thin dugout canoes sealed over to
form a sort of sled on which we glide, propelled by a gentle current,
past youths in the boughs of trees, masturbating and shaking the ripe
fruit into the water with the spasms of their bodies as their sperm
falls also to be devoured by the great green-blue fish. It is this
diet of fruit and sperm which gives the fruit fish its incomparable
flavor.</p>

<p>	Little naked boys walk
along the banks throwing fruit into the water and masturbating while
they emit birdcalls and animal noises, giggling, singing, whining,
and growling out spurts of sperm that glitter in the dappled
sunlight. As we pass, the boys bend over, waving and grinning between
their legs like sheaves of wheat parted by a gentle breeze that wafts
us to the jetty.</p>

<p>	Who are we? We are
migrants who move from settlement to settlement in the vast area now
held by the Articulated. These voyages often last for years, and
migrants may drop out along the way or adventurous settles join the
migrants. We carry with us seeds and plants, plans, books, pictures,
and artifacts from the communes we have visited.</p>

<p>	On the jetty we are
welcomed by a tall statuesque youth with negroid features and kinky
yellow hair. It is late afternoon and the boys are trooping back from
the riverbanks and orchards and fish hatcheries. Many of them are
completely naked. I am struck by the mixtures here displayed: Negro,
Chinese, Portuguese, Irish, Malay, Japanese, Nordic boys with kinky
red and blond and auburn hair and jet-black eyes, blacks with
straight hair gray and blue and green eyes, mixtures of Chinese and
Indian of a delicate pink color, Indians of a deep copper red with
one blue eye and one brown eye, purple-black skin and red pubic
hairs.</p><empty-line /><p>Arriving at the port
city after a long uncomfortable train journey from the capital,
Farnsworth checked into the Survival Hotel. The hotel was a
ramshackle wooden building of four stories overlooking the bay, with
wide balconies and porches overgrown with bougainvillea where the
guests sat in high-backed cane chairs sipping gin slings. A
promontory of red and yellow sandstone a thousand feet high cut the
town off from the sea, which entered by a narrow channel between the
rock and the mainland. Looking down from the balcony of his room on
the fourth floor, Farnsworth could see the beaches around the lagoon,
where the languid youths stretched naked in the sun. Fatigued from
his journey, he decided to take a nap before dinner.</p><empty-line /><p><emphasis>Someone touches his
shoulder. Ali is looking into the dim light of early dawn.</emphasis></p>

<p><emphasis>	"What is it?"</emphasis></p>

<p><emphasis>	"Patrol, I
think."</emphasis></p>

<p><emphasis>	We are out of the
reservation area and the penalty for being caught here without
authorization is the white-hot jockstrap. We will not be taken alive.
We have cyanide shoes, a cushion of compressed gas in a double sole
under our feet. A certain sequence of toe movements and we settle
down in a whoosh of cyanide as the Green Guards clutch their blue
throats and we streak out of our bodies across the sky. We also have
rocket-fuel flamethrowers, very effective at close range.</emphasis></p>

<p><emphasis>	This is not a
patrol. It is a gang of naked boys covered with erogenous sores. As
they walk they giggle and stroke and scratch each other. From time to
time they fuck each other in Hula-Hoops to idiot mambo.</emphasis></p>

<p><emphasis>	"Just
leper kids," Ali grunts. "Let's
make some java."</emphasis></p>

<p><emphasis>	We drink it black
in tin cups and wash down K rations.</emphasis></p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>Draft riots</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>And here I was with a
pop-happy skipper in an old leaky jinxed gallows-propelled space
tramp with all the heaviest guns of the planet trained on us: the
Countess de Gulpa (not nearly so unimportant as Pierson would have
liked me to believe), the CIA and the Board, Blum and the Movie
Studio. I figured we'd be lucky to reach Hoboken. As a matter of
fact, we got a few miles farther to what is now lower Manhattan.</p>

<p>	Four kids insisted on
guiding us to the Double G in New York and when we walked in, I saw
that the whole place changed. The gallows were gone but there were
two nooses on the wall above the bar with brass plaques: "Rope
used to hang Baboon O'Toole—June 3, 1852." "Rope used
to hang Lousy Louie—June 3, 1852." And a photo of Baboon
and Lousy Louie standing side by side on a double gallows.</p>

<p>	The decor is now the
New York of 1860: vintage crystal chandeliers and huge female nude in
a gilded frame over the bar. I spot Marty sitting with four
thuggish-looking wooden-faced characters drinking champagne, and he
waves to me.</p>

<p>	"You boys join us
and have some bubbly."</p>

<p>	We sit down and the
thugs give us a cold fishy who-are-these-nances look. The fever does
convey certain advantages. We all have a virus feel for weak points
in any opponent and Krup has given us some basic courses in unarmed
psychic combat. The techniques mostly run on a signal switch—I
love you/I hate you—at rapid intervals, but this is only
effective once a weak spot has been found.</p>

<p>	We soon have these
four hoods in line with just the right shade of show-you. Hoodlums
are ducky soup. Anyone who has to be tough on the surface is riddled
with weak spots. But don't try the switcheroo on the wrong people.
Try it on a tiddleywink and it can bounce back with a meat cleaver.
And don't tangle with some Mafia don sitting in front of his grocery
store.</p><empty-line /><p>When we walk into the
Double G in Tamaghis, we sea a heavy padlock on the gallows mechanism
with a lead seal and a notice on a brass plaque: "All public
hangings forbidden by order of the DNA Police."</p>

<p>	"Yep," the
bartender tells us. "That's right. No more publics. It's the
law."</p>

<p>	Death requires a
random witness to be real and a public hanging is real because of
random witnesses. In the Garden of Eden, God left Adam and Eve alone
to eat the fruit of the Hanging Tree and then popped back in like a
random house dick who just happened to be passing in the hall when he
heard amorous noises.</p>

<p>	"What's going on
here?"</p>

<p>	"See any
dogcatchers of Sirens in the street?"</p>

<p>	"Well, no, come
to think of it."</p>

<p>	"You won't."</p>

<p>	The bartended is a
little, thin, middle-aged Irishman with glowing gray eyes. He is
dressed in a tight-fitting green suit. He picks up ten glasses in
each hand, spreads them out on the bar, and starts polishing. "We
had a riot here. The boyos killed every dogcatcher in Tamaghis and
most of the Sirens...." He holds up a glass to the light. "The
kids all want to get out to Waghdas now and find the answers. I tell
them every time you find an answer you find six questions under it,
like leprechauns under a toadstool."</p><empty-line /><p>	New York—the
Double G—1860 ...</p>

<p>	A little, skinny,
middle-aged Irishman dressed in a filthy green suit bangs on the bar
with his beer mug and a respectful silence falls. He jumps up onto
the bar, his face contorted like an evil leprechaun as he spits the
words out: "The bankers on Wall Street and the sheenies is
buying their sons out for three hundred dollars." His eyes glow
and the hair stands up on his head. "And what about you and me
who don't see three hundred dollars a year in one piece? We get
drafted into the frigging army to fight for the frigging niggers."</p>

<p>	A bestial roar goes
up. The patrons are four-deep around the bar, brandishing clubs and
crowbars. The little green man leaps down from the bar.</p>

<p>	<emphasis>"What
are we waiting for? An invite from City Hall? Let's go!"</emphasis></p>

<p>	About
fifty blood-mad men and boys and a few screaming harpies troop out
after him screaming: <emphasis>"Kill! Kill! Kill!"</emphasis></p><empty-line /><p><emphasis>	</emphasis>"How
did the riot start?"</p>

<p>	"Well, you know
how it is with riots. Things build up and up—then something
sets it off." He tosses a chipped glass twenty feet into a trash
can. "The dogcatchers start raiding out of fair-game areas and
there is a move by the Hanging Fathers in the City Council to extend
fair-game areas. Then two foreign Countesses they call
themselves—yeah, Countess de Slutville—buy villas on the
mountain and set up something they call the Genetic Institute and
there are rumors about transplant operations carried out by this
sawbones they have brought in from Yass-Waddah."</p>

<p>	"That would be
Van ..." I put in.</p>

<p>	"It would. Next
thing these two boy-eating sows move in their own Special Police with
firearms and pressure the Council into passing an I.D.-card law so
anyone who doesn't have an I.D. card stamped and updated can be
arrested and hanged in the Institute. So all the boys have to apply
for these cards or risk getting picked up anywhere.</p>

<p>	"One
night five SPs come in here checking I.D.s and they start to drag
some kid out. They have guns of course. Doesn't do them much good.
The kids is on them with broken bottles, knives, chairs, feet, knees
and elbows. Four kids is killed but they take the SPs apart. You can
see the bloodstains right over there. Then some little Irish kid I'd
never seen before jumps up on the bar screaming: '<emphasis>What are you
waiting for? Waiting to get milked by these foreign bitches like
randy cows? </emphasis><emphasis>Kill! Kill! Kill!</emphasis>'</p>

<p>	"The SPs and
dogcatchers are barricaded in the Garden of Delight, ready to defend
the richies with their last drop of blood, and it comes to that quick
enough. They open up with machine guns but the boys just spread out
and keep coming, throwing cobblestones and Molotov cocktails.</p>

<p>	"Better than a
hundred are killed in the few seconds it takes for the rest to swarm
over the barricades and cut the guards to hamburger. Then they charge
up the mountain screaming.</p>

<p>	"<emphasis>'Death
to the Foreign Sows!'</emphasis></p>

<p>	"Well, the
Countesses and their sawbones got their asses out to Yass-Waddah in
an autogyro. Their villas were looted and burned to the ground along
with most of the other villas. The Hanging Fathers were thrown into
the fires along with all the Sirens that could be found. Some of the
rich kids was with the mob, so a few big villas are still left. But
the richies sure got a new look since then."</p>

<p>	I soon see that there
is more here than just a spontaneous explosion of overcrowded
poverty-ridden slums. The whole scene has been staged from above to
point up the need for a strong police force, and some of the mob
ringleaders turn out to be agents of big money.</p><empty-line /><p>"A young man in
dirty overalls who fought valiantly with the mob was killed by the
police and was found to possess aristocratic features, well-cared-for
hands and a fair white skin. Though dressed as a laborer in dirty
overalls and a filthy shirt, underneath there were fine cashmere
pants, a handsome rich vest and a fine linen shirt. His identity was
never learned."</p>

<emphasis>Gangs of New York</emphasis>, p. 154</p><empty-line /><p>Through the havoc and
wreckage of the burning and looted city, through streets littered
with the dead and dying, street boys dance and caper like gay
insouciant sprites, many of them wearing Halloween masks. A boy in a
skeleton suit flops beside a stiff corpse in grotesque imitation.</p>

<p>	"You're dead and
you stink." He jumps and capers away.</p>

<p>	They prance around a
dying policeman and mimic his death throes. "Whydon'tcha get up
and stop the fight?" They snatch his hat and badge, chasing each
other.</p>

<p>	"Stop in the name
of the law," they mock.</p>

<p>	A boy snatches a coat
and vest from a looted store. Another boy in fake beard and skullcap
pops out.</p>

<p>	"Shoot him in the
pants! Shoot him in the pants! The coat and vest is mine!"</p><empty-line /><p>"They called in a
new Commandante who accepted the conditions of the rioters. The
Sirens who survived by concealing their assets someplace were
confined to licensed cathouses or deported to Yass-Waddah. They had
to walk it stark naked. Two hundred miles of desert, wild dogs,
hyenas, and leopards out there waiting. The kids lined up and whipped
them out the gates with hangman's nooses."</p><empty-line /><p>The bartender goes into
a song and dance as he taps glasses with a spoon, singing:</p><empty-line /><p>"<emphasis>She's
too fat for me</emphasis></p>

<p><emphasis>She's too fat for me</emphasis></p>

<p><emphasis>I don't want her</emphasis></p>

<p><emphasis>You can have her</emphasis></p>

<p><emphasis>She's
too fat for me.</emphasis>"</p><empty-line /><p>He wipes the bar from
one end to the other. "And the sperm dealers has left too, most
of them. Can't operate under the new conditions. And good riddance to
the Gombeen men."</p><empty-line /><p>Marty
has a good thing going. Operating with a friend in the Records
Department at City Hall he is forging quitclaim deeds to properties
in the burnt-out areas. When the smoke clears away he will owning a
big chunk of lower Manhattan. "The <emphasis>compensation</emphasis> and <emphasis>then</emphasis>
the <emphasis>building contracts</emphasis>. The whole thing drips with goodness."</p>

<p>	He has troops of boys
in the street to keep the home fires burning. And these riot boys
will later be used to harass any wise citizens who try to reclaim
their property and rebuild. The boys screaming insults at visitors.
"I catching one clap from fucky your asshole." Swarming
over the house like monkeys, leering in at windows, throwing stones
at passerby from the roof, urinating and masturbating from balconies.</p>

<p>	There are a number of
these boys sleeping in the Turkish bath where we have billeted
ourselves. They parade around naked doing imitations. Death throes
they dig special, flopping around, screaming and groaning and jacking
off while the others piss themselves with laughter.</p>

<p>	Krup gets it together
finally. Two kraut SPs at the door. "All leaves cancelled.
Report back to ship immediately." Next stop: the future.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>Tamaghis revisited</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>When we were first
stationed in Tamaghis, it was such a frantic and dangerous place that
we never got a chance to relax and look around. At that time,
Tamaghis was in the hands of the women with their dogcatchers and
Sirens, supported by a weak and acquiescent City Council.</p>

<p>	Since the I.D.-card
riots, the massacre of Sirens and dogcatchers, the flight of the
Countesses and their retinue, and the appointment of the new
Commandante from Waghdas, power had definitely shifted to the men.
The new Commandante dissolved the City Council and ruled by decree.</p>

<p>	The rioters are now
the elite of the city, setting style and tone. The fashionable thing
is to look for the answers or the questions behind sex and death. So
the youth of Tamaghis look to the academies of Waghdas. I am speaking
about ten percent of the total population. As always, the permanent
parties remain: the shopkeepers, restaurant and bar owners,
merchants, craftsmen and farmers.</p>

<p>	Tamaghis is a walled
city, circular in shape, with gates at the four cardinal points. The
population is about twenty thousand, but the area of the city would
accommodate a much larger population.</p>

<p>	Since considerations
of privacy do not apply for the emancipated youth, they live by
preference in dormitories and cubicle rooms, sharing bathing and
sanitary facilities. This concentration of personnel leaves room for
the fishponds, farms, aviaries, and orchards within the walled area,
so that the city is almost self-sufficient.</p>

<p>	And the rich, eager to
disassociate themselves from the lingering taint of the dogcatchers,
Sirens, predatory Countesses, and the infamous Hanging Fathers of the
erstwhile City Council, have made their estates productive. Some have
thrown their houses open to youth communes. Cows' milk is brought in
from a farm outside the city walls, since the new Commandante
banished all cows from the city.</p>

<p>	The mains square is a
composite of the Djemalfnaa or Marrakesh and the Mercado Mayorista of
Lima, surrounded by parks and trees. I am sitting in the Red Night
Café with Dahlfar, Bluie, and Jimmy Lee drinking tea one
afternoon. There is no alcohol and no tobacco in Tamaghis by order of
the new Commandante.</p>

<p>	A kid I recognize as a
former outcast, barred from the Double G, is moving from table to
table. Now he is a hero of the I.D. riots.</p>

<p>	The kids have a basket
full of xiucutls. This small orange-and-red speckled snake has a
venom that causes erotic convulsions and acute diarrhea and is
frequently used as a practical joke in commune initiations. Of course
you can get the same thing in ampules or poppers but the old
folkloric ways still have charms for the rich. The boy is making a
sale at a table of rich kids.</p>

<p>	Looking out across the
square, I see a man pushing a cart with crates roped onto it and one
of the kraut kids is walking alongside it.</p>

<p>	"Looks like Krup
is taking on some cargo."</p>

<p>	"He sure is,"
Jimmy tells me. "Right after the riots he bought up all the
nooses on the open market and all the noose material. The nooses he
plans to sell to tourists in Ba'dan. He's got all the old noose
merchants making rugs ... and he's shipping Red Hots and White Angels
and Blue Burns and Black Lights and Greenies—the lot. So he
cuts them with Spanish fly and sells them in the Ba'dan cathouses."</p>

<p>	"He sure is an
operator."</p>

<p>	"He's putting up
the prices, the miserable bastard."</p>

<p>	"We'd better lay
in stock."</p>

<p>	We walk around through
the bazaars pricing color poppers and aphros. The price has about
doubled but we know it's twenty times higher in Ba'dan for cut stuff.</p>

<p>	The Red Hots bring you
out in red blotches and dots, squirming around on your red-hot ass,
itching to pop, and you can top it with a Red Pop. This can be
dangerous, bringing on internal hemorrhaging or in some cases
spontaneous fracture of the vertebrae.</p>

<p>	The White Angels turn
your jism to light. A Snow Pop is a blaze of cold white light with
hot sex sparks. The Blue Burn, which is usually mixed with Yagé,
is cold and hot at the same time. You come out in a blue rash with a
cold menthol burn, and a Blue Pop is like cyanide and ozone.</p>

<p>	The Black Light turns
you black as obsidian and knocks all the white words out of your
brain so you are right there with whatever the sex scene is, and a
Black Pop brings you off in synch. The Greenie is something between
animal and vegetable. You come out in a green rash, your nuts a tight
seedpod popped off by the Green Pop.</p>

<p>	You can mix colors—say
Red Hots with a Snow Pop for bells of rosy fire ringing in the sky
while you squirt a choir of angels. Now, your partner may be doing
the same thing or he may be squirting blue twilight in attic rooms
and distant train whistles. Or you take Red Hots and smooth it with a
Black Pop and spurt deep purple. An Old Glory threesome: red fucking
blue, who is fucking white, and red pops blue, blue pops white, and
white pops red.</p>

<p>	Try the Rainbow
Special—all colors in one—and squirt Niagara Falls, Pikes
Peak, souvenir postcards, rainbows, and Northern Lights. Step right
up, good for young and old. Young boys need it special. Sometimes
they forget the heroes of the fever who made all this available to
young boys.</p>

<p>	Yeah, I'm a hero of
the fever ... Audrey thought as they made selections. But it won't
get me a discount. Yeah, I'm a hero of the fever, and knowing what
went into those products I don't like to see them cut and sold to
drunken American legion slobs. That's right—the City Fathers
are setting up an American Legion Convention. The Ba'dan Hilton and
American Express arrive in a cloud of pop stars.</p>

<p>	The proprietor, a thin
gray old man in a gray djellaba, follows us around pointing out rare

<p>	"Oh there are
some Itchy Tingles!" Audrey explains. "Just the thing for
my high-school Christmas play. Give me a case."</p>

<p>	"Oh and there are
some Firsties. I'll take all you've got."</p>

<p>	A Firsty Pop is the
hyacinth smell of young hard-ons, a whiff of school toilets, locker
rooms, and jockstraps, rectal mucus and summer feet, chigger lotion,
and carbolic soap—whiffs you back to your first jackoff and
leaves you sitting there on the toilet—if you don't keep flying
speed. Never linger over a Firsty.</p>

<p>	We walk through the
flower markets, florist shops and greenhouses. Sex nettles for
fraternity initiations. It's more fun than paddles. Orchids that grow
into your flesh, tendrils stirring vegetable lusts. And here is a
humanoid mandrake six feet in height.</p>

<p>	"Is it a
screamer?" Audrey asks.</p>

<p>	"It sure is, son.
And when he screams it will bring off every living creature for a
twenty-yard radius. And the beauty of it is, he lives on your shit
... saves you installing a toilet."</p>

<p>	"What makes him
scream?"</p>

<p>	"You fuck him,
son. Or jack him off or suck him off and he screams like a major."</p>

<p>	"What happens if
we hang its green ass, roots and all?" Jimmy asked.</p>

<p>	"Son, you'd be
doing what mankind has always trembled to do. You'd be upsetting the
balance between the animal and the vegetable kingdom. He'd scream the
planet apart. It would be the last scream."</p>

<p>	"He certainly has
potential as a weapon," Audrey mused. "That is, if he
weren't so bulky."</p>

<p>	There are bits and
pieces of many cities in Tamaghis. We are walking down a street of
worn blue cobblestones rather like the outskirts of Edinburgh when a
little boy falls in beside us. About four years old, I think at
first. He has a rolling walk like a sailor. He is dressed in shorts
with a white sailor shirt and white tennis shoes. I put my hand on
his shoulder and he snaps at it with sharp little teeth.</p>

<p>	"Keep your hands
off me, you bastard."</p>

<p>	And I see that he is a
miniature youth of eighteen.</p><empty-line /><p>When we make it back to
the ship with the kid, who has pulled a sailor cap out of his pocket,
and get to our cabin there are two more krauts in it. Krup is making

<p>	What tall tales
indeed. Tacitus tells us that the Scythians, a warlike and horsey
people, hanged their captives from trees like an old western posse.
And Herodotus gives a lurid account of their practices.</p>

<p>	When a Scythian king
died, fifty pure-blooded Arabic horses and fifty handsome youths were
strangled, disemboweled and stuffed. The horses were then placed in a
semicircle around the tomb and the youths mounted the horses, being
held in place by a stake which passed through the body of the horse
and into the ground and through the anus of the youth up to the top
of his skull for good posture....</p>

<p>	A baneful red glow
flares across the northern sky, bathing the city of Tamaghis in a
flickering red light shading from light pink to dark purple, flowing
like water through the ancient twisting streets cut from desert rock
which has now powdered to sand under generations of shuffling feet.</p>

<p>	The first thing you
notice here is the dead muffled silence of the sand-covered streets.
Now we hear music and singing as a strange procession winds into
sight. Naked boys with boots of rotten animal hides crawling with
mnaggots lead a column of horses on which boys are riding naked and
bound. The Carrion Boys caper and whinny and rear and fart, showing
their teeth like horses.</p>

<p>	Now the procession
halts in front of the King's tomb and the horses are being strangled
with ratchet cords that tighten and cannot be unloosed. A horse
rears, baring his teeth and rolling his eyes as blood drips from his
nose ... the horses are turning intolerably into youths ... shrinking
faces spit out horse teeth like bullets. A horse rolls on its side
kicking spasmodically, sloughing off hooves and sinews and hide,
patches of human skin breaking through. Another rolls on its back
kicking its legs in the air as the tail whisks in between human legs,
kicking human genitals, shooting horse pricks, as intestine spurt
from shrinking bellies and brains jet out from eye sockets.</p>

<p>	As they emerge from
the ruptured horse bodies, the youths are seized by the
carrion-booted boys with long red hair and gloating idiot smiles. The
youths and horses have all been strangled.</p>

<p>	It is time now for the
butchery, which they attack with good cheer as one boy heartens his
companions with a comic bump-and-grind striptease with intestine that
drop off as his erect member snaps out. He sticks his tongue out and
ejaculates as his friends roar with laughter. They are a simply happy
people.</p>

<p>	Now there is work to
be done. The horses must be stuffed with aromatic herbs and the
youths impaled on stakes that will hold each boy astride a dead horse
until horse and rider crumble into the red dust. The Carrion Boys
caper away and disappear in little eddies of sand under the red sky
shot with meteors and Northern Lights.</p>

<p>	Wilson looked at his

<p>	Wilson reached for a
standard "Quarantine and Repatriations" form. "That's

Toby is alone in the locker room. The old YMCA building has been sold
and only a few boys still stay on. They have moved into the locker
room because it is warmer and the showers are there.</p>

<p>	Now
all the other boys have gone away somewhere for Christmas and Toby
knows that most of them will not be coming back, since the building
has to be vacated by January 18, 1924. Toby is reading <emphasis>The Time
Machine</emphasis> by H. G. Wells.</p><empty-line /><p>I gave it a last tap,
tried all the screws again, put one more drop of oil on the quartz
rod, and sat myself in the saddle. I suppose a suicide who holds a
pistol to his skull feels much the same wonder at what will come next
as I felt then ...</p>

<p>	I seemed to reel; I
felt a nightmare sensation of falling ...</p>

<p>	I am afraid I cannot
convey the peculiar sensations of time travelling. They are
excessively unpleasant. There is a feeling exactly like that one has
upon a switchback—of a helpless headlong motion! I felt the
same horrible anticipation, too, of an imminent smash. As I put on
pace, night followed day like the flapping of a black wing ...</p>

<p>	The twinkling
succession of darkness and light was exceedingly painful to the
eye.... The sky took on a wonderful deepness of blue, a splendid
luminous color like that of early twilight; the jerking sun became a
streak of fire, a brilliant arch, in space; the moon a fainter
fluctuating band.... Minute by minute the white snow flashed across
the world, and vanished, and was followed by the bright, brief green
of spring ...</p><empty-line /><p>There is a stew
simmering on a gas ring and occasionally Toby stirs it, listening to
the chimes from the Salvation Army mission across the street playing
"Silent Night." He remembers other Christmases, the smell
of pine and plum pudding and the old smell of his steam engine.</p>

<p>	He had been brought up
in a three-story red brick house in a middle-western town. When he
was six years old his parents died, in the flu epidemic of 1918.
After that, a series of uncles and foster parents took care of him.</p>

<p>	Nobody wanted Toby for
long, though he was a beautiful boy with yellow hair and huge blue
eyes like deep lakes. He made people uneasy. There was a sleepy
animal quiescence about him. He never talked except in answer to a
question or to express a need. His silence seemed to hold a threat or
a criticism, and people didn't like it.</p>

<p>	And there was
something else: Toby smelled. It was a sulfurous rank animal smell
that permeated his room and drifted from his clothes. His father and
mother had had the same smell about them, and they kept a number of
pets: cats, raccoons, ferrets and skunks. "The little people,"
his mother called them. Toby took the little people with him wherever
he went, and his uncle John, an executive on the way up, liked big
people.</p>

<p>	"John, we have to
get rid of that boy. He smells like a polecat," Toby's aunt
would say.</p>

<p>	"Well,
Martha, perhaps there's something wrong with his glands." The
uncle blushed, feeling that <emphasis>glands</emphasis> was a dirty word.
<emphasis>Metabolism</emphasis> would have been much better ...</p>

<p>	"That's
not all. There's something in his room. Something he carries about
with him. Some sort of <emphasis>animal</emphasis>."</p>

<p>	"Now Martha...."</p>

<p>	"I
tell you, John, he's <emphasis>evil</emphasis>.... Did you notice the way he was
looking at Mr. Norton? Like some horrible little gnome...."</p>

<p>	Mr. Norton was John's
boss. He had indeed been visibly discomfited by Toby's silent
appraising stare.</p>

<p>	Looking back, Toby
could see the twinkle of Christmas-eve ornaments. Far away his father
points to Betelgeuse in the night sky. The locker room holds the
silence of absent male voices like a deserted gymnasium or barracks.</p>

<p>	The boys have built a
partition of beaverboard and set up their cots in this improvised
room. There is a long table with initials carved in the top, folding
chairs, and a few old magazines in the main room where the gas ring
is located. In one corner is a withered Christmas tree that Toby
pulled out of a trash can. This is part of his stage set. He is
waiting for someone.</p>

<p>	He tastes the stew. It
is flat and the meat is tough and stringy. He adds two bouillon
cubes. Another fifteen or twenty minutes. Meanwhile, he will take a
shower. Naked, waiting for the water to heat up, he is examining the
graffiti in the toilet cubicle, running his hands over phallic
drawings with the impersonal interest of an antiquarian. He is a
plant, an intrusion. He has never seen the other boys, a whiff of
steaming pink flesh, snapping towels, purple bruises. He leans
against the wall of the toilet as silver spots boil slowly in front
of his eyes.</p>

<p>	Christmas Eve, 1923:
You see the old YMCA building. Someone he carried with: Hi/ ...</p>

<p>	"Hi. It's me,
Toby."</p>

<p>	His
father points to a few boys still staying there ... the shower's
silence. Other boys have gone away. Part time in this improvised
room. Building has to be vacated by the folding time machine where
the gas ring is hot occasionally. Toby pulled out of the mission,
stage set, other Christmases. His part is six years old in the
epidemic. Toilet cubicle, his old face, remote parents. Sleepy animal
whiff of naked flesh Christmas geese in the sky. Silent night for
someone died waiting for the graffiti in 1918. If you ask for
something solid as shirt and pants walks ... long sight you read <emphasis>The
Monkey's Paw</emphasis>? Years over phallic drawings snapping towels and
purple bruises....</p>

<p>	Toby dresses and walks
back into the "living room," as they  call it. A man
sitting at the table. He is thin and white-haired with blue eyes. His
pants and shirt are red-and-white-striped like peppermint. A long
patched coat is folded on the chair beside him. Wisps of fog drift
from the lapels.</p>

<p>	"Well, Toby, and
what would like for Christmas?"</p>

<p>	"Well, sir, I
guess people ask for a lot of silly things, so I'd like to ask your
advice before making up my mind."</p>

<p>	"Yes,
Toby, people do ask for silly things. They want to live forever,
forgetting or not knowing that forever is a time word and time is
that which ends. They want power and money without submitting to the
conditions under which power and money are granted. Now I'm not
allowed to give advice but sometimes I think out loud. If you ask for
something solid like power or money or a long life, you are taking a
sight-unseen proposition.... Now, if you ask for an <emphasis>ability</emphasis>
..."</p>

<p>	"I want to learn
how to travel in time."</p>

<p>	"Well, you could
do a lot worse. Makes you rich just incidentally. But it can be
dangerous...."</p>

<p>	"It is necessary
to travel. It is not necessary to live."</p>

<p>	Toby experienced a
feeling of ether vertigo as he was pulled into a whirling black
funnel. Far away, as if through a telescope, he could see someone
sitting at a table, a slim youth of about twenty with yellow hair and
brown eyes.</p>

<p>	A fluid plop and he
was inside the youth, looking out. He was sitting in a restaurant
somewhere, taste of paper-thin cutlet, cold spaghetti, and sour red
wine in his mouth. The waiters looked ill-tempered and tired. Now he
became aware of someone sitting at an adjacent table, so obviously
looking at him that they seem for a moment to be alone in the
restaurant. It was a woman of about twenty-six, neither well nor
poorly dressed, with an older man and woman, probably her parents.
She had, Toby thought, one of the most unpleasantly intrusive faces
he had ever seen, set in an oily smile or rather a knowing smirking
cringe with a suffocating familiarity that pressed on his being like
a predatory enveloping mollusk.</p>

<p>	Toby
began to feel quite faint. Suddenly he spoke without moving his lips:
"You'll never get into a nice gentile country club with a look
like that hanging out of your Jew face.... We like <emphasis>nice</emphasis> Jews
with atom bombs and Jew jokes...."</p>

<p>	Dead silence,
wild-eyed faces looking for the source of this outrage.</p>

<p>	<emphasis>"Ach
Gott!"</emphasis> A Jewish waiter slumped to the floor in a faint.</p>

<p>	Toby shifted his
attention to a table of blacks. Yes and the right kind of darky too,
singing sweet and low out under the mimosa, not feeding his black
face in teh same restaurant with a white man and getting his strength
up to rape our grandmothers."</p>

<p>	Next a table of Latin
American diplomats.</p>

<p>	"You greasy-assed
Mexican pimps. Why don't you go back to your syphy cathouses where
you belong?"</p>

<p>	"That's telling
them!" said a southern American voice.</p>

<p>	"Go screw a mud
puppy.... And if there's anything worse it's a murdering mick with a
bomb in his suitcase."</p>

<p>	A
suitcase by a table of Irishmen began to tick. Toby put money on his
check. He lifted his wineglass to the table of Jews: "You Jews
is so warm and human. I offer to you that most beautiful of all
toasts: <emphasis>L'chaim!</emphasis> To life!..."</p>

<p>	He
was moving towards the door. "You blacks got soul." As he
passed the Latin Americans, he twitched his hips. "Qué
rica mamba.... When Irish eyes are smiling
..." In the doorway, Toby whipped his scarf around his neck and
shouted back into the room with moving his lips, so it seemed to echo
from every corner ...</p>

<p>	<emphasis>"Bugger
the Queen!"</emphasis></p><empty-line /><p>He opened the door and
heavy palpable darkness blew in with a reek of brimstone. He sprinted
for the corner in a black cloud, his red scarf trailing out behind
him like a burning fuse. Shouts behind him. Breaking glass.</p>

<p>	Here was 44 Egerton
Gardens. He opened the door with his key, slid in and shut the door,
leaning against it. A blast outside, sirens, words in his head: "Air
raid ... the blitz."</p>

<p>	He felt his way to his
room at the head of the stairs. As soon as he opened the door, the
sound of breathing and the smell of sleep told him that someone else
was there. He touched a shoulder.</p>

<p>	"Hello, I'm Jim
Everson. Hope you don't mind doubling up like this."</p>

<p>	"It's all right."
Toby stripped to his underwear and slid in beside him.</p>

<p>	They lay there,
listening to the explosions. The bombs seemed to walk in a leisurely
way up and down Brompton Road. A smell in the room, not just of warm
young flesh. It was a rank musky ozone smell, the smell of time
travel.</p><empty-line /><p>Toby woke up in a dark
cottage. Mother was not back yet. He was alone and very frightened.
The cottage was in Gibraltar and he knew the floor plan in the dark.</p>

<p>	He went from his room
into the sitting room and looked into his mother's room. The bed was
empty, as he knew it would be. The lights would not turn on. He lay
down on her bed but the fear was there as well.</p>

<p>	He went back to his
room and tried to turn on the lights. None of them would turn on. Now
even the light in his own room would not work.</p>

<p>	He opened the cottage
door and went out. Dawn light outside, but a heavy darkness lingered
inside the cottage like a black fog. He resolved not to spend another
night there.</p>

<p>	Who would not spend
another night there? He was two people—the boy who lived in the
cottage and someone else.</p>

<p>	He saw a boat. Durban
to Gibraltar. A slim youth with yellow hair and brown eyes in a blue
uniform and nautical hat was the first mate. Two officers and a crew
of eight on the brigantine.</p><empty-line /><p>The boy's mother is
back from the pub where she works as a barmaid. She is sprawled fully
dressed on the bed in a drunken sleep. He looks around at the potted
plants, a tapestry on the wall with a minaret, an ivory elephant, a
glass mouse on a shelf. In the front room, a hot plate, a square
yellow tea can with Chinese characters, a faucet dripping into a
rusty sink. Two men are in the room: one a thin man in his thirties
with a receding chin and a pasty face, and the other a priest with
reddish hair and bloodshot eyes.</p>

<p>	Slowly the boy takes
inventory of the sleazy decorations, a brass bowl with cattails in it
on the mantel of the non-functioning fireplace, a wobbly table with a
tasseled lamp, three chairs, a couch, and an army blanket.</p>

<p>	He is the boy, but
also a concerned visitor, an uncle or godfather. He is preparing to
leave. Outside the cottage is a steep weed-grown slope covered with
Christmas rubbish and artificial snow. He hates to leave the boy
there.</p>

<p>	On the slope, a paper
paddle wheel turns slowly in the wind. Written on the wheel: THE
MISSING AND THE DEAD.</p>

<p>	The priest is talking
to the mother and the other man.</p>

<p>	"Do be careful,
and if anything goes wrong don't hesitate to contact me."</p>

<p>	Dead fingers in smoke
pointing to Gibraltar. "Captain Clark welcomes you aboard. Set
your watches forward an hour." British we are, British we stay.
Marmalade and tea in the shops, ivory elephants, carved ivory balls
one inside the other, jade trees, Indian tapestries of tigers and
minarets, watches, cameras, postcards, music boxes, rusty barbed
wire, signal towers.</p>

<p>	Coming in for a
landing, he hears a tired gray priest voice:</p>

<p>	"And how long
will you be staying, Mr. Tyler?"</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>It is difficult in
train "A"</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>On the train with
Waring. Smell of steam, soot, and iron. The WCs are clogged with
shit. Landscape of red soil, streams, ponds, and farmhouses.</p>

<p>	I have a little round
box which contains a number of scenes on parchment-like paper that
come alive as I turn the pages. Some oxen by a river mired in
concrete up to the forelocks. Now four figures, two boys and two
girls in eighteenth-century garb, get out of a gilded carriage. They
take off their clothes, pirouetting to tinkling music-box notes.</p>

<p>	In the train corridor,
I encounter a French customs agent—a short heavyset man with a
red face and bloodshot green eyes—accompanied by a tall gaunt
gray-faced assistant. It seems that we are passing through a tip of
French Canada and he is here to examine passports.</p>

<p>	The door the agent is
standing before opens towards him but he is pushing the other way
with his shoulder, his weight preventing two conductors from opening
the door from the other side. At this point, he tells his assistant
to break the door down with a fire ax. I intervene to point out that
the door opens towards him. He has but to pull it open. This he
finally does, then upbraids me and the two conductors for blocking
his way.</p>

<p>	<emphasis>"Mais
je suis passenger,"</emphasis> I protest.</p>

<p>	<emphasis>"Quand
même!"</emphasis> he snaps.</p>

<p>	Now
the passengers all disembark from the train and line up with
passports in an open-air booth. The customs agent sits behind a table
against a wooden partition. Every time anyone lights a cigarette, a
DÉFENSE DE FUMAR sign appears and he looks up from the table
shouting, <emphasis>"Défense de fumer."</emphasis></p>

<p>	I am first in line.
The agent looks at my passport and sneers.</p>

<p>	"Is this
something of your own invention?"</p>

<p>	I tell him it is
something issued by the United States Government.</p>

<p>	He looks at me
suspiciously and says: "It says here that you live in London."</p>

<p>	"And so?"</p>

<p>	There is a girl behind
me in line holding an American passport. I point out that my passport
is the same. He snatches her passport and looks at it. Then he slaps
both passports down on the table and turns to his assistant.</p>

<p>	"Destroy these
documents."</p>

<p>	"But you can't go
around destroying people's passports. Are you deranged?" I ask.</p>

<p>	<emphasis>"Dérangé?"</emphasis>
he sneers, turning now to the girl. "Is this man your
accomplice?"</p>

<p>	"Nothing of the
sort. I never saw him before."</p>

<p>	"But you travel
on the same train?"</p>

<p>	"Well, yes ...
but ..."</p>

<p>	"And sit at the
same table?"</p>

<p>	"Well, yes, it so
happened ..."</p>

<p>	"So you admit to
sitting at the same table with this man you have never seen before?
And perhaps you share also the same compartment? The same bed, no
doubt?"</p>

<p>	"It's not true!"
she screams.</p>

<p>	Soldiers light a wood
stove. The assistant speaks: "Pardon me, sir, but my son is a
collector. Could I keep one of these forgeries?"</p>

<p>	"You may keep
one. Which do you prefer?"</p>

<p>"Well,
the girl, sir. She is prettier. My son will whack himself off looking
at it, I don't mind telling you."</p>

<p>Very
well. Destroy the other passport."</p>

<p>	My passport is dropped
into the wood stove. He turns to the other American passengers.</p>

<p>	"All of you now
come forward and surrender your lies. Documents purportedly issued by
a government which ceased to exist two hundred years ago...."</p>

<p>	A chorus of outraged
protests goes up from the passengers but soldiers snatch their
passports and dump them into the stove.</p>

<p>	"Well, Mother and
I want you to know we will report you to the American Consul," a
tourist moans.</p>

<p>	The officer stands up.
"The currency you are carrying is of value only to a collector.
I doubt if you will find one in a town of this size." He gets
into the train, which starts to move.</p>

<p>	"But what about
our luggage?"</p>

<p>	"It has been
impounded. You may recover it in the capital on presentation of valid
passports."</p>

<p>	The train gathers
speed. We are standing in a turn-of-the-century western town: water
tower, a red dirt street, Station Hotel &amp; Restaurant. I leave my
countrymen waving credit cards and traveler's checks in front of a
bland Chinese behind a counter who takes a toothpick out of his
mouth, looks at the end of it, and shakes his head.</p>

<p>	I walk along the
street past a saloon and barbershop and turn into a rundown
weed-grown street: Street of Missing Men. The houses on both sides
look deserted. As I walk, the buildings change and the street slopes
steeply down.</p>

<p>	BATHS OPEN DAY AND
NIGHT. I go into a steam room with marble benches. A boy smooth and
white as alabaster beckons me and I follow him through a maze of
showers and steam rooms into a waiting room and out into the street
looking for a taxi on a steep stone platform over a green slope with
stone steps going down.</p>

<p>	We are looking for a
Twin Taxi. He has a twin with him who is crippled, one leg in a cast.
The alabaster youth sits next to me on a stone bench. He has no white
to his eyes, which are a delicate egg-blue and shiny as glass. He
sits there with his arm around my shoulder, talking a strange
language that sets off little cartoons and film sequences ... languid
white legs flicker ... silver buttocks in a dark room....</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>I can take the hut set</p>

<p>anywhere</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>I have rented a
riverfront shack from someone named Camel. The river is slow and
deep, half a mile wide at this point. Rotting piers along an unpaved
street. Loading sheds in ruins, roofs fallen in. Standing in the
middle of the street I turn now towards a row of houses. The houses
are narrow and small clapboards, peeling paint, galvanized iron roofs
separated by drainage ditches choked with weeds and brambles, rusty
tin cans, broken stoves, pools of stagnant water running to culverts
broken and blocked with refuse. I go up steep wooden steps to what
had been a screened front porch. The screening is rusted through and
the screen door off its hinges. I open a padlock and push the front
door open. A musty smell of disuse and a sudden chill. Warm air seeps
into the room behind me and where the outside air and inside air come
in contact I see a palpable haze like heat waves. The house is about
twenty feet by eight feet.</p>

<p>	On my left is a
blackened kerosene stove on a shelf attached to the wall, supported
in front by two two-by-fours. On the rusty burner a blue coffeepot
with a hole in the bottom. Above the stove are shelves, some dented
cans of beans and tomatoes, two jars of preserved fruit covered with
mold. Two chairs and a wooden bedstead at the end of the room, a
stepladder by the bed . To the right of the bedstead is a door which
opens onto a bathroom with two oak toilet seats side by side, a
bucket black with rust, a brass faucet covered with verdigris.</p>

<p>	I go back to the
street and look around. At one end the street ends in a tributary. I
walk the other way and the road turns inland. There is a shack with
the sign SALOON at the turning. I go in and a man with eyes the color
of a gray flannel shirt looks at me and says, "What can I do for
you?"</p>

<p>	"Where can I buy
tools and supplies? I just rented the Camel shack."</p>

<p>	"Yes I know. Do
with a bit of fixing up, I guess.... Far Junction ... One mile up the
road."</p>

<p>	I thank him and start
walking. Dirt road, flint chips here and there, ponds on both sides.
Far Junction is a few buildings and houses, a water tower and a
railroad station. The tracks are weed-grown and rusty. Chickens and
geese peck in the street. I go into the general store. A man with
pale gray eyes and a black alpaca jacket looks up from a seat behind
the counter.</p>

<p>	"What can I do
for you, young man?"</p>

<p>	"Quite a few
things. I've rented the Camel shack."</p>

<p>	He nodded. "Do
with some fixing up, I guess."</p>

<p>	"It sure can.
More than I can carry."</p>

<p>	"You're in luck.
Deliveries twice a week. Tomorrow."</p>

<p>	I
walked around pointing: copper screening, tools, tacks, hinges,
two-burner kerosene stove, five gallons of kerosene, ten-gallon water
container with spigot and stand, water barrel, cooking utensils,
flour, bacon, lard, molasses, salt, pepper, sugar, coffee, tea, case
each canned beans and canned tomatoes, broom, mop, bucket, wooden
washtub, mattress, blankets, pillows, knapsack, bedroll, slicker,
machete, hunting knife, six jackknives. The proprietor walks behind
me writing the purchases down on a clipboard. Alligator
Gladstone bag? Fifteen dollars. Why not?
Jeans, shirts, socks, bandanas, underwear, shorts, pair extra walking
boots, shaving kit, toothbrush.</p>

<p>	I pack the clothes and
toilet articles into the bag....fishhooks, leaders, sinkers, lines,
floats, minnow seine.</p>

<p>	Now for the guns. Colt
Frontier six-inch barrel 32-20 caliber, a snub-nosed 38 inside belt
holster (this I pack in the bag), double-barrel twelve-gauge shotgun.
I look at the lever-action rifles.</p>

<p>	"It would be
handy to have a 32-20. Same shells for pistol and rifle. Anything
around here need a heavier load?"</p>

<p>	"Yep. Bear. It
isn't often a bear attacks ... when he does, this"—he
tapped a box of 32-20 shells—"would just aggravate him."</p>

<p>	He paused and his face
darkened. "Something else needs a heavier load and longer
range...."</p>

<p>	"What's that?"</p>

<p>	"Folk across the
river."</p>

<p>	I picked up the Colt
32-20 and holster. "Any law against packing a gun in this town?"</p>

<p>	"There's no law
in this town, son. Nearest sheriff is twenty miles from here and
keeps his distance."</p>

<p>	I loaded the gun and
strapped it on. I picked up the Gladstone bag.</p>

<p>	"How much do I
owe you?"</p>

<p>	He calculated rapidly.
"Two hundred dollars and forty cents plus a two-dollar delivery
charge. Sorry about that. Things keep going up."</p>

<p>	I paid him. "Much
obliged. Delivery buckboard leaves at eight tomorrow morning. Best
get here a bit early. Likely think of a few more things you'll need."</p>

<p>	"Any place to
stay here?"</p>

<p>	"Yep. Saloon
Hotel three doors down."</p>

<p>	Drugstore next door.
Old Chinese behind the counter. I bought tincture of iodine, shaving
lotion, permanganate crystals for snakebite, a tourniquet, a scalpel,
a five-ounce bottle of opium tincture, a five-ounce bottle of
cannabis extract.</p>

<p>	Saloon Hotel. The
bartender had russet hair and a face the same color. A calm slow way
about him. Two drummers at the bar drinking whiskey, talking about
the rising wholesale cost of fencing. One fat and clean-shaven, one
thin with a carefully trimmed beard. Both of them looking like they
stepped out of an old photo album. Poker game in one corner. I buy
half a pint of whiskey and a stein of beer and carry them to a table.
I measure myself some cannabis extract and wash it down with whiskey.
I pour myself another shot, sit back and look around. A boy turns
from the bar and looks at me. He is about twenty with a wide face,
eyes far apart, dark hair and flaring ears. He has a gun at his hip.
He gives me a wide sunlit grin and I push a chair out with one foot.
He carries a glass of beer over and sits down. We shake hands.</p>

<p>	"I'm Noah."</p>

<p>	"I'm Guy."</p>

<p>	I hold up the bottle
of cannabis extract. "Want some?"</p>

<p>	He reads the label and
nods. I measure it out and he drinks it with a splash of beer. I fill
two glasses with whiskey.</p>

<p>	"I hear you
rented the Camel shack on the river," he says wriggling his
ears.</p>

<p>	"That's right."</p>

<p>	"Could you do
with some help fixing it up?"</p>

<p>	"I sure could."</p>

<p>	We drink in silence.
Frogs croaking outside. It's dark when the bottle is finished. I call
to the bartender.</p>

<p>	"Got anything to
eat?"</p>

<p>	"Passenger pigeon
with corn bread, hominy grits and fried apples."</p>

<p>	"Two orders."</p>

<p>	He steps to the end of
the bar and taps on a green panel. The panel opens and the Chinese
from the drugstore looks out. Bartender gives him the order. When the
food comes we eat ravenously. Time travel makes you hungry. After
dinner we sit, observing each other with impersonal attention. I can
feel the chill of silent space and a second we our breath in the air.
One of the drummers shivers and looks around at us then turns hastily
back to his whiskey.</p>

<p>	"Shall we take a
room?" I ask.</p>

<p>	"I've got one
already."</p>

<p>	I pick up my bag. The
bartender hands him a heavy brass key. Number 6, second floor. He
goes in first and lights a kerosene lamp on a table by the bed. Room
contains a double bed with brass bedstand, faded rose wallpaper, a
wardrobe, two chairs, copper luster washstand and pitcher. I see a
Gladstone bag like mine but this one has seen a lot of wear.
Travel-stained, the stains unfamiliar. We take off our guns and hang
them on the bedstead.</p>

<p>	"What caliber?"
I ask.</p>

<p>	"32-20."</p>

<p>	"Same here."</p>

<p>	I point to a rifle in
one corner: "30-30?" He nods.</p>

<p>	We sit down on the bed
and take off our boots and socks. Smell of feet and leather and swamp
water.</p>

<p>	"I'm tired,"
I say. "Think I'll turn in."</p>

<p>	"Me too. I've
come a long way."</p>

<p>	He blows out the
kerosene lamp. Moonlight streams through the side window. Frogs
croak. An owl hoots. A dog barks in the distance. We take off our
shirts and pants and hang them on wooden pegs. He turns towards me,
his shorts sticking out at the fly.</p>

<p>	"That stuff makes
me hot," he says. "Shall we camel?"</p>

<p>	When I wake up
sunlight is streaming in the front window.</p>

<p>	We get up, wash and
dress and go down to the bar for a breakfast of ham and eggs, corn
muffins and coffee. We walk up to the store, where a youth of fifteen
or sixteen is loading the buckboard. He turns and holds out his hand.</p>

<p>	"I'm Steve
Ellisor."</p>

<p>	"Noah Blake."</p>

<p>	"Guy Star."</p>

<p>	The boy wears a Colt
Frontier at his hip.</p>

<p>	"32-20?"</p>

<p>	He nods. He has russet
hair and skin the same color. I figure he must be the son of the
saloonkeeper. I go into the store and buy a slicker, mess kit and
bedroll for Guy, a two-man tent, a can of white paint with three
brushes, a bushel of apples, corn on cob and three stools. We give
the Ellisor boy a hand loading the gear, climb in back and sit on the
stools. The boy takes the reins and we move off down the road. When
we come to the turn the boy points to the saloon.</p>

<p>	"Get
some bad <emphasis>hombres</emphasis> in there sometimes. Not that he wants their
custom. They come anyway looking for trouble."</p>

<p>	I remember the pale
gray eyes of the saloonkeeper and wonder if he is related to the
store owner in Far Junction.</p>

<p>	"Yep," the
boy says, reading my mind, "brothers. Only two families
hereabouts, the Bradfords and the Ellisors.... except for those who
come in from outside...."</p>

<p>	"Anybody else on
the riverfront?"</p>

<p>	"Two Irish and a
girl if you could call her that ... end house by the inlet ...
expecting more visitors in a few weeks...."</p>

<p>	"These
bad <emphasis>hombres</emphasis> you mentioned. Where they come from? ..."</p>

<p>	"Across the
river." He points. I can make out the outlines of a town through
the morning river mist. "When the fog lifts you can see their
fucking church sticking up." The boy spits. He stops in front of
my shack.</p>

<p>	"I could help you
fix the place up....Just one delivery to make down the road...."</p>

<p>	"Sure. We could
do with some help...."</p>

<p>	"Would a dollar
be too much?"</p>

<p>	"Sure not."</p>

<p>	"All right. I'll
drop the gear off and be right back...."</p>

<p>	Guy and I get out with
broom, mop, bucket, carbolic solution and washrags. Guy goes to river
with bucket. Up steps, new hinges for screen doors, new screening for
door and front porch. Unlock door which is heavy oak. Heave old stove
into brambles followed by coffeepot, bean and tomato cans, preserves.
Guy is back with a bucket of water into which he pours carbolic. He
is mopping up bathroom and cleaning toilets while I sweep. Under the
dust the floor is yellow pine in good condition. Yellow pine paneling
on walls and ceiling, Trapdoor leads to attic.</p>

<p>	Guy is cleaning table
and shelves when the Ellisor boy returns with buckboard. Boy
unhitches horses and hobbles the strawberry roan.</p>

<p>	Next to unload in
sequence. We don't talk, we know what to do. Water container by
stove. Fill container from two five-gallon cans. Fill boiler with
river water. New stove on table. Fill stove with kerosene. Fill
burner under boiler with kerosene, put in new wick. Groceries and
cooking utensils on shelves and stove and nails. Mattress and
blankets on walnut bedstead. Trunks along wall, bedclothes packed in
trunks, Gladstone bags out of the way in the attic. We take off our
shirts. Steve's body is red-brown like his face. Guy's body also
tanned but tanned in overlaid blotches like dab painting.</p>

<p>	"Star tan,"
he tells me.</p>

<p>	Steve and Guy start
screening the porch. I take ladder outside and scrape the walls for
paint. Old paint comes off easy. One wall scraped. Screen door on
hinges, porch half-screened. Time for lunch. Lemonade, apples,
flapjacks. Screening finished on porch. New screen for the two side
windows. Scraping. Painting. No wasted movements, no getting in each
other's way, no talking. Time laid out in screening, painting,
putting things away in trunks, storing cases of food and ammunition
in attic. At four o'clock we are looking at a neat house, white and
shining like a ship in the afternoon sun. I mix a copper-luster
pitcher of lemonade. We go out and sit on the porch steps. There it
is in the afternoon sun, a white church steeple with a gold cross on
top. I can see the mean pinched hate-filled faces of decent
church-going women and lawmen with nigger notches on their guns.</p>

<p>	Steve retrieves the
bean and tomato cans I have thrown away and puts them up on a beam of
the loading shed about thirty-five feet from the porch steps. He
walks back towards us, pivots in a crouch, draws, aims, and fires,
gun held in both hands and extended at eye level.</p>

<p>	SPLAT</p>

<p>	A tomato can explodes
dripping tomato juice down the beam. Steve sits down. Guy stands up,
draws, and aims and fires.</p>

<p>	SPLAT</p>

<p>	Bean can explodes.</p>

<p>	I stand up, arms
relaxed, both eyes open. Look at target. See bullet hit. Release draw
mechanism. Gun jumps into my hand.</p>

<p>	SPLAT</p>

<p>	We fire six rounds
each and reload.</p>

<p>	Smell of black powder,
smoke, beans and tomatoes. Steve gets a shovel from the porch corner,
walks around by side of house tapping ground with his feet. He stops
and digs, fills can with earth and thick red worms. We get three
lines on spools with hook, leader, float. Guy and I take our 30-30s.
We walk down road to the tributary which is about forty feet wide at
junction with river. As we pass the end house I see three people
sitting on the porch which is overgrown with vines. A dark Irish boy
grins and waves. Sitting on either side of him are a boy and girl,
obviously twins. They both have casques of bright orange hair and
blank inhuman expressions. They wear green shirts and pants and
yellow shoes. They look at us, faces twitching. Across the inlet the
road continues overgrown with weeds and bushes. I start to take out
my line. They boy shakes his head.</p>

<p>	"Catfish here."</p>

<p>	He leads the way along
a path through undergrowth by the inlet. A water moccasin thick as my
arm slides into the water.</p>

<p>	"Here."</p>

<p>	We stop by a deep blue
pool, bait hooks and drop lines in. In a few seconds floats are
jerked down out of sight and we are pulling out bass and jack salmon.
We are cleaning the fish when I hear a deep growl. We turn, picking
up 30-30s. Twenty feet away a huge grizzly stands on its hind legs,
teeth bared. Cock guns.</p>

<p>	Click</p>

<p>	Click</p>

<p>	Steve slides his Colt
out. We freeze and wait. The bear drops to all fours, growls and
lumbers away. As we pass the end house I see that there is no one on
the porch but the door is open. I call from the road.</p>

<p>	"Want a fish?"</p>

<p>	The dark youth comes
to the door naked with a hard-on.</p>

<p>	"Sure."</p>

<p>	I toss him a
three-pound bass. He catches it and goes back inside and I hear the
fish slap flesh and then a sound neither animal nor human.</p>

<p>	"Strange folk.
Where they come from?"</p>

<p>	Guy points to the
evening star in a clear pale green sky.</p>

<p>	"Venusians,"
he says matter-of-factly. "The twins don't speak English."</p>

<p>	"You speak
Venusian?"</p>

<p>	"Enough to get
by. They don't talk with the mouth. They talk with the whole body. It
gives you a funny feeling."</p>

<p>	We light kerosene
lamps, cut boneless steaks off two jack salmon. While the fish cooks,
Guy and I drink whiskey and lemonade.</p>

<p>	There is a hinged
table with folding legs attached to the wall opposite the stove. We
sit on stools, eating the jack salmon which is perhaps the best pan
fish in the world if you prefer the more delicate flavor of
freshwater fish. We sit on the porch in the moonlight looking across
the river.</p>

<p>	"Be all right if
they stayed there and minded their own business," Steve said.</p>

<p>	"Ever hear about
smallpox minding its own business?" Guy asks.</p>

<p>	The boy slept between
us light as a shadow. Thunder at dawn.</p>

<p>	"Have to get
started. The road floods out."</p>

<p>	Smell of rain on
horseflesh. The boy in a yellow slicker and black Stetson waves to us
and whips the horse to a trot as rain sluices down in a gray wall.</p>

<p>	We make a pot of
coffee and sit down at the table. We sit there for an hour without
saying anything. I am looking at two empty stools. Going zero, we
call it. A gust of wind knocks at the door. I open the door and there
on the porch is the boy with orange hair from End House. He is
wearing a slicker and carrying a gallon can. He points to a
five-gallon can of kerosene in a corner of the porch. I get a funnel
and fill his can.</p>

<p>	"Inside? Coffee?"</p>

<p>	He steps warily into
the room like a strange cat and I feel a shock of alien contact. He
twitches his face into a smile and jerks a thumb at his chest.</p>

<p>	<emphasis>"Pat!"</emphasis>
He ejaculates the name from his stomach.</p>

<p>	He throws open his
slicker. He is naked except for boots and a black Stetson. He has a
hard-on straight up against his stomach. He turns bright red all
over, even his teeth and nails, an idiot demon from some alien hell,
raw, skinned, exposed, abandoned yet joyless and painful like a
prisoner holding up his manacles, or a leper showing his sores. A
musky rotten smell steams off him and fills the room. I know that he
is trying to show us something and this is his only way to
communicate.</p>

<p>	The words of Captain
Mission came back to me.</p>

<p>	"We offer refuge
to all people everywhere who suffer under the tyranny of
governments."</p>

<p>	I wondered what
tyranny had led him to leave his native planet and take refuge under
the Articles.</p>

<p>	The rain stopped in
the late afternoon and we walked down to the inlet in a gray twilight
and shot two wood pigeons from a dripping tree.</p>

<p>	A sharp sickening
smell. In the middle of a red carpeted room I see a plot of ground
about six feet square where strange bulbous plants are growing.
Centipedes are crawling among limestone rocks and from under a rock
protrudes the head of a huge centipede. I arm myself with a cutlass
and someone I can't see clearly picks up a piece of firewood. I kick
the rock over but the centipede digs deeper and I can see that it is
huge, perhaps three feet long. Now it is under my bed and I wake up
screaming. I know that I must make preparations for a war I thought
had ended.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>Please to use studio</p>

<p>postulated to you</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>We arrive at Ba'dan
around midnight local time. The space front is stacked with garbage
under sputtering blue arc lights. Garbage collectors' strike. Someone
is always on strike in Ba'dan.</p>

<p>	Smugglers of every
variety are moored at Ba'dan. The skippers all get together at the
annual Skipper Party and award a gold cup to the all-around "Vilest
Skipper of the Year." Skipper Krup von Nordenholz will win hands
down. There are also cops of every variety making deals with the
skippers and arresting anyone who doesn't have the fix in.</p>

<p>	We hail a cab.
"Where's the action here, Pops?"</p>

<p>	"Wal, I reckon
you boys want to go to Fun City. Better pick some artillery first."</p>

<p>	He stops at a
neon-lighted all-night gun shop. The shopkeeper has all the old
western models and some of the new-fangled double-action 38's. These
guns shoot an aphro charge that can disable or kill. Neck and heart
shots are fatal, stomach, solar plexus and genital hits are
knockabout shots.</p>

<p>	Audrey selects a
snub-nosed 38 in a quick-draw holster. Pu slips a 41 Derringer into
his vest pocket and straps on a Smith &amp; Wesson 44.</p>

<p>	"It's a much
better load than the 45, old sports."</p>

<p>	Fun City is on a
plateau that falls steeply on one side down to the river that
separates Ba'dan from Yass-Waddah. On this slope is a vast casbah—the
houses are connected by catwalks, trapdoors, and tunnels—that
contains the largest per capita criminal population ever seen
anywhere. Ba'dan breaks a lot of records.</p>

<p>	We walk into a leather
bar called the Stretch Nest. A goodly crowd is there—four feet
deep at the bar, waiting in line for openings at the gambling tables,
going up the wide red-carpeted stairs to private hanging rooms
followed by waiters with trays of drinks and buckets of champagne.</p>

<p>	The usual costume is
boot and chaps, bare ass and crotch. Some have tight-fitting chamois
pants up to midthigh and shirts that come to the navel. Many are
naked except for boots, gun belts, and hang-noose scarves. Nooses
dangle every ten feet from a beam down the center of the room.</p>

<p>	A hang fistfight draws
a circle of cheering onlookers, as two kids smash each other in the
face—lips cut, eyes black, noses broken, spurting blood. One
kid is down—he tries to get up and falls on his side.</p>

<p>	The winner bends down
and ties his arms with a noose scarf. Next thing, the kid is hanged
and his semen spatters the bar. The bartender wipes it off with his
bar rag.</p>

<p>	Now an old rooster,
strapped into his corsets, comes in a-gunning for some kids to hang
at his debutante daughter's coming-out party. He settles on Pu who
has seen him a-coming and has the Derringer palmed.</p>

<p>	"Fill your hand,
you young varmint," the old gun drawls. Pu shoots him in the
neck with the Derringer and he falls farting and shitting, the
corsets bursting off him.</p>

<p>	"Lucky thing he
had his clothes on, old sports."</p>

<p>	A
naked fifteen-year-old sticks his head in the bar. <emphasis>"The
Clantons and the Earps is shooting it out at the O.K. Corral."</emphasis></p>

<p>	A great bestial whoop
goes up from the bar. The patrons shove and jostle out past hanged
corpses, slipping in sperm. And they head for the O.K. Corral ...
there it is right beside it a gallows that can service thirteen at a
time.</p>

<p>	The Clantons and the
Earps walk towards each other, naked except for gun belts and boots,
meeting cock to cock.</p>

<p>	"You boys have
been looking for a fight ..." Wyatt drawls. "Now we aim to
give it to you." He draws and gets Billy Clanton in the crotch.
Billy sags but he knocks Wyatt out with a solar-plexus shot from the
ground. Doc Holliday turns sideways but Ike Clanton circles and gets
him right in his skinny ass. Virgil and Guy Earp are down. The
Clantons have won.</p>

<p>	The Earps and Doc
Holliday are hanged simultaneously. The crowd goes hanging mad.
Gunfights all up and down the street, people sniping from windows and
doorways, casting from rooftops with deep-sea fishing gear and
nooses, trying to snag someone off the street.</p>

<p>	They are lined up at
the gallows. Ropes are unslung and bodies thrown aside, some of them
still alive, strangled by street boys or picked up by roving Buzzard
Bands.</p>

<p>	People hang from
balconies, trees, and poles. Even horses are hauled into the air,
kicking and farting, while boys prance around them, showing their
teeth in mimicry.</p>

<p>	The culmination of
this loutish scene is now at hand as drunken cowpokes drag screaming
whores out of the cathouses.</p>

<p>	"You've given me
your last dose, you rotten slut."</p>

<p>	"My
God, they're hanging <emphasis>women</emphasis>!" Audrey gasps.</p>

<p>	"Enough
to turn a man to stone," drawls Captain Strobe. "Let's get
<emphasis>out </emphasis>of here." Six youths in chaps bar the way.</p>

<p>	"In a hurry,
stranger?"</p>

<p>	"Yes," says
Audrey and he kills him with a neck shot. He flops against another
boy, deflecting his aim. Audrey and Pu are unbelievable with
hand-guns. They boys are all down now or dead.</p>

<p>	We walk away and leave
them, fair game for any roving band of vigilantes. Before we turn a
corner, they are seized by the Hanging Fathers—naked except for
their clerical collars. The Hanging Fathers represent one of the
sects under the control of the Council of the Selected. They are one
of the most powerful organizations in Ba'dan.</p>

<p>	We stroll along to the
amusement-park section. Here are the elevators, parachute, and
roller-coaster gallows and all variations of hanging roulette. "From
Russia with Love" is played like Russian roulette. You stand on
the trap with the rope around your neck and you get a gun with one
live load. You spin the cylinder and then, instead of putting the gun
to your own head, you aim at someone in the audience—if you can
draw an audience or anyone within range—and if it's the live
shell, the shot springs the release. Or maybe some yokel throws a
firecracker under the gallows—they'll work up to an atom bomb
eventually.</p>

<p>	Now the wall of a
building flies up and there are thirteen Commies hard at it, and we
take off across the park, bullets whistling all around us. We duck
behind the elevator-gallows building—ten stories, three hundred
feet long.</p>

<p>	You
start at the tenth floor with a rope around your neck and drop down
at express speed, and when the elevator <emphasis>stops</emphasis> a panel flips
open and you get popped. And, of course, you can play roulette on the
elevators, any odds you want.</p>

<p>	Audrey is getting that
weak feeling—it's the wet dream of his adolescence, going down
very fast in an elevator that suddenly stops. He didn't know what it
meant then. Now he just has to try it.</p>

<p>	So up to the tenth
floor. A red-carpeted corridor runs the length of the building. On
one side a Turkish bath, on the other the elevators, green lights
showing when the elevator is vacant. Youths, draped in towels or
naked, come out of the showers and steam room to importune in the
hall.</p>

<p>	Audrey beckons
imperiously to an attendant: "Do you have a well-equipped think
room?"</p>

<p>	"Oh yes, sir.
Right this way, sir. Very sensible of you, sir, if you don't mind me
saying so, sir."</p>

<p>	The youths mutter
angrily. "Come up here for a free feel."</p>

<p>	"<emphasis>Hombre
conejo</emphasis>.... Fucking rabbit man."</p>

<p>	Inside the think room,
the boys put on helmets. There are dials and screens—you can
call your shots. Will it be an open elevator? The moon is full. The
lights of Yass-Waddah twinkle across the bay.</p>

<p>	Audrey could throw a
potent curse. Or something with mirrors and video cameras—home
movies to show his friends when he has a comfortable little bungalow
in a nice residential district of Ba'dan.</p>

<p>	Everything is
permitted in a think room, so Audrey simply lets himself go. An open
elevator or a mirror job? Why not both, one after the other?</p>

<p>	POP		POP		POP</p>

<p>	He is spattering death
all over Yass-Waddah across the bay. Now he reaches out for the
hermaphrodites and transplants of Yass-Waddah.</p>

<p>	Two
of these creatures undulate in, trilling, "You <emphasis>know</emphasis> what
happens <emphasis>now</emphasis>, don't you, Audrey?"</p>

<p>	Jerry's head is on the
body of a red-haired girl and her head is on his body, long red hair
down to his nipples. Audrey gets the Gorgon Queezies at the sight of
them.</p>

<p>	"We're
going to <emphasis>pop</emphasis> you, Audrey."</p>

<p>	An open elevator for
this one.</p>

<p>	<emphasis>"Here
you goooooooooo...."</emphasis> Her hair blows up around her head like
flames from hell.</p>

<p>	POP</p>

<p>	Audrey is learning to
relax and throw his pops. A fire starts in a warehouse across the
bay.</p>

<p>	Now for the Big
Dipper, which towers eight hundred feet into the night sky, all lit
up with twinkling stars. Biggest and fastest roller coaster in the
solar system. Like I say, Ba'dan breaks a lot of records.</p>

<p>	Audrey stops in a
little café he just remembers, up this little street and turn
right ... they sit under an arbor and order mint tea and all take a
whopping dose of Itchy Tingles.</p>

<p>	"You chaps just
back up my play. Give me all your Itchy Tingle prana when I pop."</p>

<p>	"Sure thing, old
sport."</p>

<p>	Audrey
remembers a very exclusive little shop—you don't get through
the door or even <emphasis>find</emphasis> the door unless the proprietor likes
your looks. Audrey knows him from Mexico City where Audrey was a
private eye in another incarnation.</p>

<p>	Inside the shop, he
buys winged-Mercury sandals and a helmet with wings from a whooping
crane. He tops off the ensemble with a silver wand.</p>

<p>	They take a private
car on the Big Dipper. Audrey stands with a silver silk noose around
his neck, feet apart, knees bent, riding the dips, the wand moving in
front of him. Up they go now—up up up up up—Audrey is
getting a hard-on ... a dizzy pause and now, the Big Dipper comes
down down downdowndown and levels off. Audrey extends his arm and the
wand tingles straight for the power plant of Yass-Waddah.</p>

<p>	P O P</p>

<p>	All the lights in
Yass-Waddah go out.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>A lecture is being
given</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>Jimmy Lee is checking
dials. "We better get out of here fast before they get our
range."</p>

<p>	We walk over to the
shooting galleries and penny arcades on the edge of the plateau. A
high electric fence separates Fun City from the vast slum area in
Ba'dan that stretches down to the river and extends along the river's
banks.</p>

<p>	It is 3:00 A.M., a
warm electric night, violet haze in the air and the smell of sewage
and Coleman lanterns. The pitchmen wear pink shirts, striped pants,
and sleeve garters. They have gray night faces, cold eyes, and smooth
patter.</p>

<p>	One of the shills with
a Cockney accent and a thin red acne-scarred face, standing in front
of a curtained booth, makes a gesture that is unmistakably obscene
and at the same time incomprehensible. Audrey is reminded of an
incident from his early adolescence down on Market Street, brass
knucks and crooked dice in pawnshop windows and a smooth high-yellow
pitchman trying to talk him into a "museum," as he called
it.</p>

<p>	"Shows all kind
masturbation and self-abuse. Young boys need it special."</p>

<p>	Audrey does not
exactly understand what the man is talking about. He turns and walks
abruptly away. The mocking voice of the pitchman follows him.</p>

<p>	<emphasis>"Hasta
luego, amigo."</emphasis></p>

<p>	We
walk on and stop in an all-night restaurant where an old Chinese
serves us chili and coffee. He puts a CLOSED sign on the front door
and locks it.</p>

<p>	"Out this
way...."</p>

<p>	He shows us out the
back door into a weed-grown alley by the fence. Frogs are croaking
and the first light of dawn mixes with the red sky. A boy pads up
beside us silent as a cat.</p>

<p>	"You come with
me, mister. Somebody want to talk you."</p>

<p>	The boy has a
straw-colored face dusted with orange freckles, kinky red hair, and
lustrous brown eyes. He is bare-footed and dressed in khaki shorts
and shirt. We walk along beside the fence.</p>

<p>	"Here."</p>

<p>	The boy pulls aside a
piece of tar paper. A little green snake slides away. Under the paper
is a rusty iron panel set in concrete. We go down a ladder and
through a winding passage that smells of sewage and coal gas, out
into a narrow street that looks like Algiers of Morocco.</p>

<p>	The boy suddenly
stops, sniffing like a dog. "In here, quick."</p>

<p>	He guides us into a
doorway, up stairs and a ladder onto a roof. Looking down, we see a
patrol of six soldiers with machine guns checking every doorway on
the street. Audrey studies the gray faces and cold fishy eyes of the
soldiers.</p>

<p>	"<emphasis>Junkies.</emphasis>"</p>

<p>	"Fuckin'
Heroids—" the boy spits.</p>

<p>	The boy guides them
through a maze of roofs and catwalks down a skylight, finally
stopping in front of a metal door. He takes a little disk from his
coat pocket. The disk bleeps faintly and the door opens.</p>

<p>	A Chinese youth stands
there. He is wearing a pistol in a holster at his belt. It is a bare
room with a table, chairs, a gun rack, and a large map on one wall. A
man turns from the map. It is Dimitri.</p>

<p>	"Ah, Mr. Snide,
or should I say Audrey Carsons, so glad to see you again." We
shake hands. "And your young assistant as well." He shakes
hands with Jimmy Lee. "Both somewhat altered—but none the
worse for wear."</p>

<p>	We introduce the
others.</p>

<p>	"You are welcome,
gentlemen ... and now, there is much to explain." He stands
before the map with a long thin hazel stick in his hand. "We are
here—" he circles the area below the plateau of Fun City
down along the Ba'dan riverfront. "It is known as the Casbah.
Outlaws and criminals of all times and places are to be found here.
The area is heavily patrolled and the soldiers, as you have observed,
are all heroin addicts. Their addiction conveys immunity to the fever
and assures absolute loyalty to their masters who, of course, supply
them ... extra rations for arrests ... rations cut for any
dereliction of duty."</p>

<p>	"It's neat,"
I put in. "But couldn't they buy it somewhere else?"</p>

<p>	"No, they could
not. We control the black market. No pusher would serve them unless
he is tired of living."</p>

<p>	"But why not? If
they can get it someplace else, that breaks the monopoly."</p>

<p>	"We have other
plans which you will learn in good time."</p><empty-line /><p>Dimitri was giving a
lecture accompanied by slides and moving films:</p>

<p>	"Ba'dan is the
oldest spaceport on planet Earth and like many port towns has
accreted over the centuries the worst features of many times and
places. Riffraff and misfits from every corner of the galaxy have
jumped ship here or emigrated to engage in various pernicious and
parasitic occupations, swelling the ranks of brothel keepers, whores,
pimps, swindlers, black-market operators, go-betweens and fixers. The
class and occupational structure is compartmentalized like an Arab
city."</p><empty-line /><p>Blue twilight was
filling the narrow twisting alleys of the city. The stranger
shivered, gathering his ragged cloak about him. Lights were going on
behind latticed windows.</p>

<p>	Here and there blue
streetlights sputtered in sockets. A beggar crawled into the street,
barring his way and holding forth a bowl fixed into the stump of his
arm like a ladle. His legs were twisted, limp and boneless, his
shaven head was fetal, his lips parted with a fetid yellow exhalation
of breath. The stranger stepped by him and the beggar muttered curses
in a gurgling liquid dialect that seemed to bubble up from noisome
depths. The stranger felt as if he were being pelted with filth, the
words sticking to the back of his cloak with a vile stench. Just
ahead was a stone stairway half a house high stained with garbage and
phosphorescent excrement. Beyond he could see a misty, blue-lit
square. As he stepped into the square, which was littered with rubble
half-buried in sand, he found himself surrounded by a gang of filthy
youths about four or five feet in height, mewling and chittering and
chirruping among themselves as they moved closer to blocking his way
and sidling in behind him. At first glance in the blue light and
drifting wisps of fog the boys appeared simply as ragged hungry waifs
bent on extorting what money they could from a stranger. Looking
closer, he saw that they were all in some way inhuman.</p>

<p>	Some had long red hair
and sputtering green eyes and their hands were armed with needle
claws dripping fluid in the blue light. They were wearing leather
jockstraps and short fur cloaks that gave off a rank smell of stale
sweat and half-cured skins that billowed around them as they moved.
He noted that the inside of their cloaks was faintly phosphorescent
and surmised that the skins had been cured by rubbing in the
phosphorescent excrement that littered the streets. The boys hissed
through sharp yellow teeth with snarling smiles as the hair stood up
on their heads and legs, bristling like animals. Others, completely
naked despite the cold, had smooth reptilian skins, crystal dark eyes
and long flexible tails tipped with points of translucent pink
crystal. They swung the tails up between their legs pointing at the
stranger with mocking bumps and grinds as they hissed in simulated
ecstasies. Other boys had crystal fingertips, which they drew out to
needles, clicking them together like tuning forks to little rhythms
that set his teeth on edge.</p>

<p>	The boys drew closer.</p>

<p>	"Why do you block
my path? I am a stranger who would pass in pass."</p>

<p>	One boy stepped
forward and bowed so that his long red hair brushed the stranger's
boots in a gesture of mock servility.</p>

<p>	"A thousand
pardons, oh nobly born. But he who would pass here must pay the price
of passing. This is reasonable, is it not?"</p>

<p>	As the boy
straightened up he grabbed the bottom hem of the stranger's cloak and
leaping high in the air with a shrill animal cry pitched the cloak up
over the stranger's head.</p>

<p>	The other boys imitate
his cry and wave their arms like the flying cloak. The stranger is
now naked except for leather shorts and knee-length leather boots
that cling tightly to his calves and flare up the backs of his
thighs. He moves sideways, trying to beep the boys from getting
behind him, and reaches for his spark gun. A boy lights on all fours
like a cat, tail arched over his back. From the pointed crystal tip
he quivers out a shower of red sparks that spatter the stranger's
body with burning erogenous sores that twist and writhe into diseased
lips whispering the sweet rotten fever words. The sparks are coming
from all sides, stirring in his nipples, opening in his navel,
mewling and chittering from his crotch and rectum.</p>

<p>	Audrey woke up with a
start, his phallus tight against his thermal jockstrap.</p><empty-line /><p>Dimitri's voice droned
on, hypnotically lulling: "The area adjacent to the spaceport is
an international and intergalactic zone known as Portland. Portland
has its own administration, customs, and police. Biologic inspection
and quarantine measures are enforced by the DNA police force. These
are highly specialized officers qualified in every branch of
medicine, authorities on every disease and drug in the galaxy.</p>

<p>	"They are armed
with the most sophisticated weapons: Infra-Sound and DOR guns, fear
probes, death guns that can be adjusted to kill, stun or disperse,
and devices shooting tiny pellets of nerve gas and toxins.</p>

<p>	"There officers
are highly skilled interrogators, trained in telepathic techniques,
equipped with the most advanced lie detectors, with readings taken
from the sensitive reactions of living creatures: this flower droops
at a lie, and this octopus turns a bright blue.</p>

<p>	"In certain cases
where the subject has been trained to circumvent telepathic probes
and lie detectors, and where time is short (a nuclear device must be
located and deactivated), the DNA interrogators have recourse to
injections of stonefish venom. This poison produces the most intense
pain known. It is like fire through the blood. Subjects roll around
screaming.</p>

<p>	"And here, in
this syringe, is the antidote which brings immediate relief."</p>

<p>	On screen an impassive
interrogator holds up a tiny syringe filled with a blue liquid.</p><empty-line /><p>A man with a wrinkled
old-woman face and toothless mouth was bending over him, his head
ringed by a halo of blue light.</p>

<p>	"Well, young guy,
it's a good thing I happened along." He picked up the spark gun
and hefted it. "Now this little trick could fetch a right price
in the right place...."</p>

<p>	The stranger tried to
stand up and fell backward, hitting his elbows.</p>

<p>	"Easy does it,
young feller." The man helped him to his feet. "And right
this way."</p>

<p>	Every step sent
excruciating stabs of pain through his body. His throat ached and he
was spitting blood. His legs felt numb and wooden. He had to lean
heavily on the man's arm to keep from falling.</p>

<p>	"Here we are."
The man kicked at a strange animal in the doorway, a cross between a
porcupine and a possum.</p>

<p>	"Fucking lulow!"</p>

<p>	The lulow snarled and
scrambled away. The man inserted a rod with a pattern of holes into
the lock and the door opened into a dingy hallway with stairs at the
end.</p>

<p>	He guided the stranger
into a room to the right of the door. The window opening on the
street was high and barred and the plaster walls were painted blue.
The man lit a torch in a socket: blue light, a filthy bed, a sink,
table and stools.</p>

<p>	"No place like
home, what?"</p>

<p>	He pulled a tattered
coverlet of blue velvet over the grimy bedding and the stranger
slumped down. The numbness in his legs was wearing off and he felt
unbearable shootings and pricklings, like recovery from frostbite. He
covered his face with his hands, groaning in agony.</p>

<p>	The man held out a
tiny syringe filled with blue liquid.</p>

<p>	"Shoot your way
to freedom, kid."</p>

<p>	The stranger held out
his shaking hands.</p>

<p>	"Roll up your
sleeve. I'll hit you."</p>

<p>	Cool blue morning by
the creek, soft remote flute calls, sad and sweet from a dying star.
Phosphorescent stumps glow in the blue twilight that hangs over the
streets at noon like a haze.</p>

<p>	Red brick houses line
blue canals where crocodiles play like dolphins. Lost mournful stars
dim as spark boys chitter and mewl against his shoulder, a frosty
luminescence off their back-sides, cool remote garden, lead gutters
dripping, a stone bridge where a boy stands with a sad blue monkey on
his shoulder.</p>

<p>*</p>

<p>"Fun City is a
segregated vice area occupying a plateau on the north side of the
city. Here gambling houses and brothels of many times and places
promise to satisfy any taste, but these establishments are, for the
most part, tourist traps and clip joints with more shills and Murphy
men than whores."</p>

<p>	Audrey blinks at the
screen. He must have seen Fun City through fever-tinted glasses. Seen
on the screen, it is a vast composite honky-tonk, temple virgins
sealed while you wait, Aztec and Egyptian sets looking like 1920s
movie theaters, hula girls around swimming pools with paper palms,
fan-tan games with tasseled lamps and geisha girls, New Orleans
whorehouses with fake Spanish moss and houseboats on filthy lakes and
canals, massage parlors, Dante's Inferno with female impersonators
... the whole scene made in Hollywood.</p>

<p>	"The real action
is in the Casbah, but tourists are afraid to go there, scared off by
horror stories concocted by the trades-people and the Fun City
shills. Addicts are routinely burned or overcharged in Fun City, so
they head for the Casbah, where any drug can be had for a price.</p>

<p>	"The
Casbah is built into the hills and bluffs that slope down to the
river. This vast ghetto houses fugitives and displaced persons.
Outlaws in every sense, they pay no taxes and are entitled to no
municipal services. Criminals and outcasts of many times and places
are found here: bravos from seventeenth-century Venice, old western
shootists, Indian Thuggees, assassins from Alamut, samurai, Roman
gladiators, Chinese hatchet men, pirates and <emphasis>pistoleros</emphasis>, Mafia
hit-men, dropouts from intelligence agencies and secret police."</p>

<p>	Cameras pan old
western sets, bits of ancient Rome, China, India, Japan, Persia, and
medieval England.</p>

<p>	"Over the
centuries, the area has been mined with tunnels so that all the
buildings interconnect. The tunnels also give access to a maze of
natural caves and caverns.</p>

<p>	"There are cable
cars and wires with hand carriages and jump seats that run from
building to another. The Flying Squirrels, little people like Igor,
hop from the highest bluffs in hang-gliders, skipping from roof to
roof, carrying messages, drugs, and weapons.</p>

<p>	"The Casbah
spills into the river in a maze of piers, catwalks, moored boats and
rafts. The tunnels at river level are half full of water, forming an
underground Venice with gondolas and limestone palaces dripping with
stalactites.</p>

<p>	"Any services can
be purchased in the Casbah—from assassination to such illegal
operations as I.T. —Identity Transfer. There are whores, from
the most sophisticated courtesans and Rems who offer wet dreams to
order, to such mindless organisms as the Happy Cloak and the Siren
Web.</p>

<p>	"Any
drug can be had in the Casbah for a price. Longevity drugs that
require ever-increasing dosage, the addict crumbling to putrescent
dust if the drug is withheld. Joy Juice: blackout in erotic
convulsions and every shot takes years off the user's life-span. A
Joy Juicer lasts two years on average and ends up a burnt-out idiot
hulk. And Derm my God what a feeling ... soothes your skin down to
flexible marble ... but if you don't get it  ... the irritation of
the dermal nerve endings ... well I've seen a kicking Dermy tear
himself to pieces with his own hands. The Blue and the Gray, heavy
metal drugs so habit-forming that a single shot results in lifelong
addiction. Yes, every drug can be had here <emphasis>for the price</emphasis>."</p><empty-line /><p>"Now you take the
stonefish poison...." He tapped the vial of milky fluid. "...
Like fire through the blood; morphine won't touch it, but this Blue
shit is fifty times stronger. So combine the fish poison and the
Blue"—he draws the milky fluid into the syringe—"for
a Fire Fix!"</p>

<p>	The stranger was
running short of credits. No money for luxuries like Hot Shots. Jay
had a deal going to bring in some Gray but it was dragging out and
then the panic hit.</p>

<p>	Suddenly there was no
Blue in the city. Heroin just barely took the edge off like codeine
with a heroin habit. The cold fire in his bones kept him in constant
agony and he was bleeding through the skin: blood-sweat, it's called.</p>

<p>	Fortunately, he had
not been on long enough for the spontaneous amputations that leave
arms and legs smoldering blue stumps. With the last of his credits,
he went to a clinic for a deep-freeze sleep cure.</p><empty-line /><p>"On the south side
of Ba'dan, along bluffs overlooking the river, are the vast estates
of the rich, guarded by their own Special Police. Recently, sons of
the rich, bored with the tinsel attractions of Fun City, began
frequenting the criminal ghettos. Some of these youths are addicts
and drug dealers, others are purposeful agents sounding me out with
offers of aid and weapons.</p>

<p>	"The
administration, courts, and police occupy a governmental area. A pass
is required for entrance. The large middle class of tradesmen,
artisans, and minor functionaries occupy the middle of the city,
hemmed in between Portland, Fun City, the Casbah, and the
governmental area."</p>

<p>	Camera pans a
wasteland of housing projects like the drearier sections of Queens.</p>

<p>	"Traditionally,
the city of Ba'dan is ruled by a City Council in which the very
wealthy hold an overwhelming majority. Now, the discontented middle
class is demanding more seats in the Council. These demands are
fanned by agitators under orders from the Council of the Selected
with headquarters in Yass-Waddah.</p>

<p>	"The Council of
the Selected controls a number of cults that are finding adherents
among the middle-class youths. These cults are basically of
low-church Protestant derivation.</p>

<p>	"Agents from the
Council of the Selected are also organizing paramilitary groups and
smuggling in arms. These agents operate with the connivance of the
Heroid Police.</p>

<p>	"The basic issue
is a proposed Anschluss with Yass-Waddah that would leave the Council
of the Selected in virtual control of both cities. The plan is
supported by the middle class, who are ignorant of the intrigues of
the Council to ruin Ba'dan economically and eventually to close the
spaceport.</p>

<p>	"To distract
attention from these maneuvers, agents of the Council, vociferously
self-righteous, call for a cleanup of Fun City, a crackdown on the
Casbah, and an end to the international status of Portland. The
wealthy see the Anschluss as a danger to their position, but much
more vulnerable and immediately threatened are the inhabitants of the
Casbah."</p><empty-line /><p>He is dozing off. Dry
cold rasps his raw lungs ... putting on his clothes, shivering,
dropping things, cold burn in his bowels, just made the privy, a
trough of smooth red stone in the hall streaks of phosphorescent
shit, a smell like rotten solder, burning shivering sick, he needs
the Blue Stuff. Dry blue crystals of snow on the floor stir in an
eddy of wind and a crystal spark boy takes shape, naked, radiant, his
long needle fingertips dripping the deadly Joy Juice, bright red hair
floating about his head, disk eyes flashing erogenous luminescence,
his erect phallus smooth as seashell with a tip of pink crystal, he
is like some dazzingly beautiful undersea creature dripping deadly
venoms.</p><empty-line /><p>"Yass-Waddah, a
spaceport in rivalry with Ba'dan, is a matriarchy ruled by a
hereditary empress. Here men are second-class citizens who can only
achieve status as courtiers, servants, shopkeepers, agents and
guards.</p>

<p>	"Those
who fall into none of these categories try frantically to ingratiate
themselves as informers. No city in the cosmos is so riddled with
informers as Yass-Waddah. The Ba'dan word for informer is <emphasis>Yass</emphasis>.</p>

<p>	"The inner city
of Yass-Waddah is forbidden to any male being, except the Green
Guards, genetic eunuchs, pot-bellied but strong. They form the shock
police of Yass-Waddah.</p>

<p>	"Latterly, Her
Serene Majesty, the Empress, is being pushed upstairs into the attic
as the Council of the Selected moves in, backed by the powerful
countesses de Vile and de Gulpa, smarting from their defeat and
narrow escape in Tamaghis. They are pushing for the Anschluss, after
which the Heroids and the Green Guards will wipe out Tamaghis and
block the way to Waghdas forever.</p>

<p>	"The riots we are
here to foment are simply a prelude to an all-out assault on
Yass-Waddah. We are pushing for a final solution. There can be no
compromise. Even the memory of Yass-Waddah must be destroyed as if
Yass-Waddah had never existed."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>Afterbirth of dream</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>Smell of the salt
marshes, slivers of ice at dawn, catwalks, towers, and wooden houses
over the water where white-furred crocodiles lurk ...</p>

<p>	There are many albinos
in the city with hair white as snow and long slanting black eyes, all
pupil, like black shimmering mirrors. Many of the inhabitants change
color with the seasons—being white in winter and changing in
summer to a mottled green-brown.</p>

<p>	The summers are almost
tropical and the marshes bloom with a rich profusion of flowering
trees and shrubs along pools and canals. Here and there patches of
swamp poppies with pods big as cantaloupes bursting with
reddish-brown opium.</p>

<p>	It was a fall day,
leaves turning, crisp frosty air. Most of the people were out in red
hair and freckles, yellow, sepia, and orange.</p>

<p>	Naked with the spark
boy in narrow stagnant streets. Saffron smoke curls out between his
legs and fades to pale yellow and violet as the boy winks and capers
away.</p>

<p>	When young Audrey woke
up, the smell was still there oozing from the yellow cashmere blanket
that covered his naked body. He closed his eyes, remembering the
arrival in Ba'dan ... a shabby whorehouse district called Fun City
where he had gone to meet his contact ... the briefing from Dimitri
during which he kept dozing off ... dreams in which Fun City became
an arena for deadly sexual games ... encounters with the spark boys
... addiction to a radioactive drug known as the Blues ... the clinic
... the doctor.</p>

<p>	There was another body
in the bed beside him. Opening his eyes and turning his head, he saw
milky-white skin, amber hair, and the face of an idiot angel.</p>

<p>	"Toby."</p>

<p>	An English boy named
Arn with a foxy, red face and a corrupt insinuating leer: "Popper
Toby, we calls him. When he gets in—eat the smell of him—pops
you right enough. Bit of a lark, mate."</p>

<p>	Toby opened huge blue
eyes and looked at Audrey, the pupils contracting. He kicked the
blanket down and arched his body, stretching.</p>

<p>	The room is cold with
a dusting of dry snow on the floor from the round opening in the wall
that serves as a window. Audrey shivers, hugging his knees against
his chest.</p>

<p>	"Oh my." Arn
stands at the foot of the bed in a red turtleneck sweater, green
corduroys, and sandals. "Just popped in to put some water on for
tea."</p>

<p>	Arn then lights an
alcohol stove and turns back towards Toby and Audrey, peeling off his
sweater and pants. "Coo..." he says.</p>

<p>	A violet smoke pours
from Toby's scent glands, blanketing Audrey's body with a smell of
hyacinths, cyanide, and ozone. Audrey is choking, gasping, in a flash
of violet light.</p>

<p>	Audrey sits up
groggily. "Where's Toby?"</p>

<p>	Arn puts a hand on
Audrey's chin, turning his head around to face a tarnished mirror on
the wall above his bed: "Mirror mirror on the wall ..."</p>

<p>	A vertebra pops in
Audrey's neck. Arn clicks his tongue. Audrey is looking into the
vacant blue eyes of Toby, seeing the milky-white flesh, larval and
wraithlike, clinging to his body.</p>

<p>	Arn points to the
mirror. "Gor blimey you shoulda 'eard 'im before we got together
like. Right school tie 'e was." Arn says this in those clear
penetrating upper-class English tones. You can hear every word fifty
feet across a hotel dining room.</p>

<p>	"You've
'eard of me, myte. <emphasis>Arn the voice</emphasis>. 'Absolutely breathtyking,'
said a gentleman from the <emphasis>Times</emphasis> and the Queen dropped 'er
haitches on TV. Wouldn't you?"</p>

<p>	He tossed Audrey his
underwear. "Nip into your duds, luv. Nobody is lyte for
briefing. It's like rehearsals in show biz."</p><empty-line /><p>In the operations room,
Dimitri is passing out photos and addresses for hit assignments. Arn
is nowhere to be seen. Audrey is looking at the photo of the man he
is to kill: a thing Italian face with protuberant yellow eyes glowing
with sulfurous hate.</p>

<p>	"Don't looka me
..." screams the photograph.</p>

<p>	This will be a
pleasure, Audrey thinks. I have not come justa looka you—you
greasy worthless black-market wop.</p>

<p>	Dimitri point to the
map: "Right there. Runs a cigarette store. Smuggled stuff. Also
an Uncle, a Broker, a Buyer. Pays off in info to operate. He's got
lookouts in this kiosk and this grocery store who report any
strangers in the neighborhood. Two metal detectors, here and here.
He's got another in the door of his shop and a sawed-off shotgun
under the counter. You pick up your gun here after you pass the first
two detection points. The detector in his doorway will be
disconnected."</p>

<p>	A miniature youth,
passing for an eight-year-old street boy, clicks his heels and bows.
"I am the Disconnector."</p>

<p>	"And you're just
a dumb space sailor," Dimitri tells Audrey, "looking to
pick up a few cartons of smuggled cigarettes." He glances at
Audrey's clothes—blue pullover, seaman's pea jacket, blue pants
... "And here's your hat. After you do the job on him, you walk
out with your cigarettes and go to this Chinese laundry. They'll show
you out the back way."</p>

<p>	In the street, Toby's
face is an asset. With vacant blue eyes, yellow hair and seaman's
clothes, no one could look less like a dedicated and purposeful
assassin.</p>

<p>	He pauses frequently,
looking at a map of the city which he can't figure out how to fold up
again, so he fumbles it together and stuffs the protesting paper into
his pocket. Just a dumb fucking kid space sailor.</p>

<p>	Now he feels the eyes
from the lookouts, probing, hate-filled, but not suspicious. Just the
contempt of the angle boys for a mark, a crumb who worka for a
living. He drops his map and as he bends down to get it, pulls loose
a brick from a wall and gets the gun. He can feel the lookout's eyes
on his ass.</p>

<p>	"Looks like a
fucking fruit—takes it up the farter."</p>

<p>	An
old Italian hag leans over a balcony: "Ha ha ha, <emphasis>maricón</emphasis>."</p>

<p>	The gun is a
snub-nosed 38 with cyanide bullets. He looks around, blushing, then
opens the door of the shop and goes in.</p>

<p>	The man behind the
counter looks at him. Audrey fumbles awkwardly and pulls off his hat.
The man's eyes spit hate and contempt.</p>

<p>	"Whatta you
want?"</p>

<p>	Audrey holds the cap
by the visor, moving it across the counter within two feet of the
man's chest. With smooth fluid casual movements, he draws the gun
from his waistband and pushes it gently into the cotton lining of the
hat.</p>

<p>	The vacant face of
Toby ages and tightens, the eyes blazing into the Italian's face like
a comet as Audrey smiles. Comprehension, then stark ugly fear,
flickers into the man's eyes as he knows what is happening and knows
it is too late to reach the shotgun.</p>

<p>	Audrey shoots three
times through the chest—a muffled sound like a backfire in
heavy snow. The man crumbles sideways, his eyes flaring out. Audrey
reaches across the counter for a carton of cigarettes. He steps
outside, looks around uncertainly and walks away.</p>

<p>	In the Chinese
laundry, and old Chinese is ironing a shirt. He jerks his head
towards the rear of the laundry. Audrey walks through into an alley
that leads to a sort of mall in sunlight.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>A walk to the end</p>

<p>of the world</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>Audrey was walking on a
mall in bright sunlight. Ahead he could see mountains shrouded in
mist, brightly colored food stands, tables under umbrellas, waiters
in red uniforms. This could be a small resort in Switzerland.</p>

<p>	He was passing a huge
marble snail, a bronze frog and a beaver. Fourteen-year-old boys
lounged on the statues in studied postures, eating ice cream and
looking at each other, insulated from the passerby by some invisible
barrier.</p>

<p>	Farther on, boys in
cowboy boots, Stetson hats and jeans posed in front of a clothing
store with the same stylized unsmiling nonchalance, engaged in some
timeless charade. A boy with white-blond hair sat on a stone bridge
dangling his legs.</p>

<p>	Audrey turning into a
paved courtyard and suddenly the air was oppressive and heavy with
tropical heat. Youths in eighteenth-century clothes lounge in cane
chairs sipping rum punch. They look cruel and languid as they caress
pistol butts in their belts with slow obscene movements.</p>

<p>	A private eye is
talking to the bartender. "What were you doing in Bill Gray's
Tropico?" It's an old western and Clem Snide is a fabled
shootist. The bar is full of black powder smoke, the smell of
entrails, blood and chili. The walls and roof fall in.</p>

<p>	A sweet dry wind rises
from the southeast. Audrey with some last-minute purchases. Almost
the same buckboard it is already take care of Meester once he gets up
beside the boy and they start off down the road where the flint chips
glitter in the sun. Ahead they see mountains shrouded in mist, the
orange and purple sky glowing behind.</p>

<p>	He must have dozed off
while he was walking—it's known as the Walkies—you get it
from space travel. You can walk and talk and get yourself around
while you are sound asleep, living in a dream. The dream is made of
your actual surroundings—so you don't bump into things. You
just see them differently.</p>

<p>	A ragged street urchin
falls in beside him for a fraction of a second. He glances sideways
and knows it is one of the miniature youths, strong and quick as
little cats.</p>

<p>	The boy flashes ahead
leading the way through mirrors and walls, through shops and urinals
that open into squares where street acts are in progress: minstrels,
Gnaoua drums, lutes, horns, zithers, tumblers, fire eaters, jugglers,
snake charmers—all blurring together.</p>

<p>	Audrey is walking very
fast to keep up with the youth's "sorcerer's gait," past a
platform where several boys are doing animal copulation acts as they
impersonate cats, foxes, lemurs, and horses, snorting, whinnying,
growling, whimpering. The spectators roll in the street pissing with
laughter.</p>

<p>	Audrey is struck by
the variety of garb and racial types that flash by like scenes
glimpsed from a train window: Mongols with felt boots,
eighteenth-century dandies in silk pumps and breeches, pirates with
cutlasses and patches, medieval jerkins and codpieces, sharp smell of
weeds from old westerns, boots and holsters, djellabas, togas,
sarongs, and youths clad in a transparent fabric like flexible glass
lounge about in the studied postures he had noticed in the
mall—obviously there to be seen ... superb Nubians naked except
for leopardskin capes and boots of hippopotamus hide ... boys in
tight rubber suits with smooth poreless faces like green-white glazed
terra-cotta.</p>

<p>	"Frog boys from
underground rivers ..." the guide throws over his shoulder.</p>

<p>	Audrey notices that
his guide and most of the other people he passes carry at their belts
a tool like a little crowbar hooked at one end. Now a ripple passes
along the street, actors and musicians are gathering up instruments
and props behind them as the word moves from lip to lip.</p>

<p>	"HIP."
(Heroid Patrol)</p>

<p>	People are dodging
into doorways, prising up manhole covers with their tools, and
scrambling down ladders into a maze of tunnels where the Heroids do
not dare to venture. Audrey follows his guide through twisting
tunnels, past youths on roller skates, scooters, and skateboards.</p>

<p>	The tunnels open here
and there into caverns where people live in stalactite-and-quartz
houses and tend pools of blind fish. Up twisting iron ladders are
Turkish baths, lodgings, houses and brothels. Privies open into
restaurants and patios.</p>

<p>	Down a rope ladder is
a dusty gymnasium where boys are practicing with various weapons as
they wait for an assignment: Jerry and Rubble Blood Pu, Cupid Mount
Etna, Dahlfar, Jimmy Lee, and the Katzenjammer Kids, as we call the
German boys. They drift over to greet him.</p>

<p>	"How'd you make
out with the Eyetie?"</p>

<p>	"Easy
and greasy and lots of fun ... the look on his lousy wise-guy face
when he <emphasis>knew</emphasis>. It was tasty."</p>

<p>	Audrey sees a number
of the little people climbing up and down ropes and swinging from
rings with great agility. He is amazed to see that some of them have
long prehensile tails and retractable claws on their feet and hands
that enable them to scramble up trees like squirrels.</p>

<p>	As he watches, one boy
drops thirty feet to the floor, lighting like a cat. The other boys
are constantly trying to touch the little people but they are
skittish of contact, dodging away from outstretched hands or snapping
with their sharp little teeth.</p>

<p>	All of them are expert
assassins, deadly with knife and strangling cord, dropping on their
victims from trees or roofs or climbing into seemingly inaccessible
windows. They are also highly proficient with firearms, using a tiny
revolver that shoots naillike projectiles and a rifle that shoots
poison darts with a range of two hundred yards.</p>

<p>	The subtlest assassins
among them are the Dream Killers or Bangutot Boys. They have the
ability to invade the REM sleep of the target, fashion themselves
from the victim's erection, and grow from his sexual energy until
they are solid enough to strangle him.</p>

<p>	Audrey finds Toby in
the locker room, sitting naked and pensive on a worn wooden bench. He
looks up absently and pats the bench beside him. Audrey sits down and
they both stare vacantly at the wall for several minutes.</p>

<p>	Finally Audrey asks,
"Is Arn around?"</p>

<p>	Toby looks at him
blankly from an empty space. "I never heard of it."</p>

<p>	"I uh thought ...
I mean this morning ..."</p>

<p>	"Well, my scent
glands are so potent sometimes people hallucinate," Toby tells
him smugly. "Perhaps you dreamed up the whole thing."</p>

<p>	"Well, maybe."
He puts his arms around Toby's shoulders hoping to excite him so he
will give out the smell which is like exquisite perfumed poppers.</p>

<p>	Toby's cock begins to
stir and stiffen as he stretches his legs out in front of him and
leans back, looking thoughtfully at his toes. Two little people come
in rubbing against his legs like cats. They give off a delicate sand
fox smell that floats on the heavier male scents of the locker room
like a pousse-café.</p>

<p>	A thirteen-year-old in
the black suit and straw hat of an English public school "fag"
sticks his head in and calls to Audrey:</p>

<p>	"The Shrink wants
to see you." He pushes his eyes up at the corners to make a
Chinese face and adds in falsetto, "Chop-chop!"</p>

<p>	After a few general
questions about space lag, the Doctor asks with elaborate casualness:
"Would you please tell me in your own words everything you
remember about this uh Arn." He glances down at a file in front
of him.</p>

<p>	Audrey tries to comply
but he encounters blanks in his memory like trying to recall a dream
that hovers just out of reach on the edge of perception, skittering
away as you try to grasp it, erasing memory traces with a little
broom that fades out, in turn wiping away footprints in distant sand.</p>

<p>	The Doctor leans
across the table and breaks an ampule under his nose. "Just
relax now and breathe in deeply."</p>

<p>	Audrey finds himself
on a table looking up at masked faces.</p>

<p>	"That's right
now—count up to fifty...."</p>

<p>	When Audrey wakes up
he finds a shaved spot at the back of his head that is slightly sore
to his touch.</p>

<p>	"Well,
Audrey," the Doctor explains, "we've installed a <emphasis>separator</emphasis>.
Might come in handy if you ever need to be in two places at once...."
He pats Audrey's shoulders. "You can leave the hospital tomorrow
morning. Now I'm going to give you an injection."</p>

<p>	The days seem to flash
by like a speeded-up chase scene in a 1920s comedy ... patrols always
behind them, bullets thudding into flesh, bombs in Middletown bars
and theaters and restaurants. A wake of glass, blood and brains and
the hot meaty smell of entrails remind Audrey of a rabbit he had once
seen dissected in biology class. A girl had fainted. He could see her
slump to the floor with a soft plop.</p>

<p>	Shatter Day always
closer ...</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>Moves and checks and
slays</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>Like many riots, the
Ba'dan riots began with a "peaceful demonstration," but
neither side had any intention of letting it end that way.</p>

<p>	The Anschluss with
Yass-Waddah was to be put to a plebiscite. Those most directly
concerned, namely the inhabitants of the Casbah, were
disenfranchised. But they had obtained permission from the Town
Council to make a peaceful demonstration in Courthouse Square around
which most of the government buildings were located.</p>

<p>	Meanwhile, Yass-Waddan
agents were arming and organizing paramilitary forces in Middletown,
intending to catch the "Arabs," as they called them,
between the Heroid Police and the armed vigilantes and wipe them out.
After which, they would demolish the Casbah and drop poison gas down
the tunnels and occupy Portland.</p>

<p>	Dimitri had his own
plans. After delicate negotiations, he had made contacts in Portland.
Portland officials are supposed to keep out of local politics except
in cases of "dire emergency." But the Anschluss posed such
a threat to their continued function, if not to their personal
safety, as to constitute a "dire emergency" and all Dimitri
asked was for a customs agent to look the other way for a few seconds
when the containers of heroin for the Heroid Police were being passed
through customs, while Dimitri's agents substituted identical
containers filled with a short-acting opiate antagonist.</p>

<p>	Dimitri also had
promises of arms caches in the courthouse building provided by
certain wealthy families who preferred to avoid more direct
involvement. None of the old families wanted the Anschluss. It was a
threat to their power and Yass-Wadan agents were talking openly about
"parasites" and "traitors."</p>

<p>	Audrey knew the battle
plan. Even if it went according to plan, there would be close
fighting and heavy casualties. So he had these special codpieces made
up of a tough plasticlike material and issued them to his team, which
was very good for morale. He was in charge of a commando group who
were supposed to break through the line of Heroids like a football
scrimmage then race upstairs to a room in the courthouse where a
cache of arms was to be waiting and then take over the courthouse
building.</p>

<p>	On the appointed day,
the demonstrators from the Casbah, after passing a metal detector and
a hand search for weapons, made their way towards the square past
snarling middies. So many things could go wrong: the guns aren't
there ... they are in the wrong place ... the keys don't work.</p>

<p>	As they filed into the
square, he saw the line of impassive Heroids in front of the
courthouse armed with 9-M grease guns. Sandbags and heavy machine
guns on tripods were at the windows and on the roof.</p>

<p>	The provocation was
carefully planted: crowbars and a stack of cobblestones from street
repairs. Audrey glanced at his watch. Two minutes to countdown.</p>

<p>	Muscular youths snatch
up cobblestones. Jeers and catcalls explode from the demonstrators.
Automatic weapons are raised. This is it.</p>

<p>	And something is
happening to the Heroids. A composite groan is followed by the sound
of emptying bowels and a reek of excrement. Instead of responding
with deadly accurate machine-gun fire, the Heroids are going down
like tenpins as the cobblestones hit. So far, Dimitri's plan is
working.</p>

<p>	On duty when there is
no time for injections, the Heroids function on heroin capsules that
dissolve at different rates, releasing a dosage every few hours.
However, what is dissolving now is not heroin but a short-acting
opiate antagonist. Withdrawal symptoms that would be severe enough
spread over several days are compacted into minutes, resulting in
immediate incapacity and, in many cases, death from shock and
circulatory collapse.</p>

<p>	A boy throws a
football block into a Heroid in front of Audrey. The gun flies out of
his hand and Audrey catches it in the air. Now they are racing from
the gangway. Two Heroids in front of the main door are trying to
raise their weapons, Audrey gives them a burst as he runs past.</p>

<p>	A heavy iron door. The
key works. Now down the gangway. Side door is open as it should be.
Upstairs and this must be the room.</p>

<p>	Key works and there
are M-16s, ammo, grenades and grenade launchers, and a few bazookas.
(The Paries he knows are equipped with the older and more cumbersome
M-15s and some even with Garands.)</p>

<p>	Immediately Audrey's
team spreads out in groups of five to take over the gun emplacements
in the building and on the roof. Audrey and four others fan into a
room. A machine gun is on a tripod behind sandbags. The crew,
sprawled on the floor and over the sandbags, is completely disabled.
Two are dead.</p>

<p>	Audrey kneels beside a
young Heroid who is lying on his back, his deathly pale face covered
with sweat, his pants sticking up at the fly. Audrey whips out a
Syrette containing a quarter-grain of pure heroin and injects it into
the boy's arm. Now the second part of Dimitri's plan is going into
effect: the conversion of the Heroids. This is why he did not simply
substitute a quick-acting poison for the heroin.</p>

<p>	The boy sits up.</p>

<p>	"Welcome
to our cause, <emphasis>comrade</emphasis>," says Audrey.</p>

<p>	The first shots in the
area signal the Paries, under the command of General Darg, to pour
out of side streets into the square, where they expect to catch the
fleeing unarmed demonstrators on the flank. Instead, they run into a
hail of machine-gun fire from the demonstrators who have seized
weapons from the fallen Heroids. Even deadlier sniper fire strikes
down from the windows and roof of the courthouse. To conserve
ammunition, Audrey's commandos keep their weapons on semiautomatic,
making sure of a hit with every shot.</p>

<p>	In a few seconds,
Darg's forces have suffered several hundred casualties. He hastily
withdraws to seize and fortify buildings on the opposite side of the
square and along the side streets leading into the square. He
dispatches troops to cover the entrances from the Casbah and to 
patrol Fun City to prevent more men and weapons being brought into
action.</p>

<p>	By the end of the
first day, rioters are in control of most of the buildings on the
south side of the square. They are, however, unable to open a passage
to the Casbah.</p>

<p>	Meanwhile, there is
much rejoicing in Yass-Waddah. The courtiers are planning a torture
festival for the captives, camping around in costumes and, of course,
there will be a prize for the most ingenious torture device. The
tortured captives will be rendered down into the most exquisite
condiments and sweetmeats: raw quivering brains served with a piquant
sauce, candied testicles, sweet-and-sour penis, rectums boiled in
chocolate.</p>

<p>	The Countess de Gulpa
admonishes her courtiers to bear in mind that only the ringleaders
deserve exemplary punishment. The rank and file will make useful
slaves.</p>

<p>	"Oh, Minny is so
kind," coo the courtiers. "Minny is so kind."</p>

<p>	Reports are coming in.
The rioters have been surrounded and will surrender in a few hours.
These reports have been sent out by General Darg, who is certain of a
final victory and does not want the Green Guards or, worse still, a
regiment of useless courtiers getting in the way and tarnishing his
glory. On the other end, the reports are further falsified to curry
favor with the countesses.</p>

<p>	The Empress of
Yass-Waddah holds aloof from these rejoicings. She knows that
whatever the outcome of the battle, her power is gone. She is, in
fact, making plans to flee the city in disguise with a handful of
faithful eunuchs.</p>

<p>	The Empress intends to
leave behind a little present for the countesses, a basket of
sleeping kundu.</p>

<p>	The dreaded kundu is a
species of flying scorpion. The body is covered by need-sharp
back-slanting red spines. The jaws are razor-sharp and designed for
burrowing like a mole cricket's. The venom that drips from the hairs
and the tail-stinger causes instant paralysis. Then the kundu sheds
it wings and burrows its way up body orifices and deposits its larvae
in the intestines, the liver, the kidneys and spleen so that the
paralyzed victim is eaten alive. Unlike other scorpions the kundu is
diurnal, remaining comatose during the cold desert nights and being
slowly roused to activity by the heat of the day.</p>

<p>	Perhaps I will win the
torture contest in absentia, the Empress thinks.</p>

<p>	The second day saw
substantial gains for the insurgents. The little people who can climb
like monkeys, moving from roof to roof with their poison dart guns,
carrying cylinders of chlorine and sulfur dioxide, flushed the Paries
out of the buildings around the square, which were then occupied by
the insurgents and the renegade Heroids. Darg and his troop, however,
remained in occupation of the buildings along the side streets and
continued to block entrances from the Casbah. Dimitri knew better
than to attempt to force a passage through these narrow streets with
troops on the roofs of buildings five and six stories in height—an
error that cost the police heavy casualties in the New York Draft
Riots of 1863. Then rioters on the roofs of buildings along the
narrow streets of lower Manhattan defeated armed police contingents
with cobblestones and other missiles.</p>

<p>	General Darg, still
sure of ultimate victory, even if a long siege was involved, refused
to ask for reinforcements and sent back reports that the situation
was under control. However, there were still a few pockets of
resistance.</p>

<p>	The third day dawned
like a bleary red eye. An old woman brought a basket of exquisite
golden figs to the kitchen door of the Countess's palace. Under the
figs, the kundu were still comatose from the icy chill of the night.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>Will Hollywood never
learn</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>In Ba'dan both sides
are looking for a showdown. Darg, because he knows that he cannot
conceal the actual state of affairs much longer. Dimitri, because he
feels that a state of siege is not to his advantage owing to the
numerical superiority of the enemy and their readier access to
supplies and weapons. So both generals evoke every aid they can
summon through magic rituals.</p>

<p>	As
the sun climbs higher, the square looks like Hollywood gone berserk.
Roman legionnaires under Quintus Curtius are fighting French riot
police. Vikings and pirates battle crusaders and Texas Rangers. Old
western gunfighters shoot it out with the Black and Tans and Kenya
Special Police. Hannibal's elephants charge a train of 1920s Marines
on their way to protect the assets of the United Fruit Co. Battle
cries and songs ring out. Peons with machetes decapitate lynch mobs
... <emphasis>mucho</emphasis> bouncing heads, meester. Battle cries and songs ring
out with grunts and bellows, war whoops, bagpipes, the reek of
horses, chili and garlic....</p><empty-line /><p>"La

They reduce narcs and Mafiosi to hamburgers. Poison darts from Indian
blowguns wipe out a Klan rally. Nigger-killing southern lawmen are
hacked to pieces by naked Scythians on horseback.</p>

<p>	Audrey is in the very
thick of it, changing costumes every few minutes. Now he leads a
detachment of amok Malay youths with krisses against the Shah's
Savak. Next Audrey, on a great black horse in medieval armor, charges
down the streets of Middletown skewering religious women and lawmen
on his lance. Then he is a shootist with his custom-made 44
double-action revolver leading the Wild Bunch to break up an
auto-da-fé in Lima. Now he boards a Spanish man-of-war with
cutlass and laser gun. Machine-gun bullets, poison darts, arrows,
spears, boomerangs, bolos, throwing knives, cobblestones. Rockets
whistle through the air, sharp smell of weeds and dry heat from old
westerns, snow and ice with Viking ships, amok Malays trail muggy
heat and jungle smells, pirates blow in with a sea wind and a whiff
of rum and spices, pitchmen and camp followers spread out their
wares, false-front saloons, whorehouses, taco stands, carny booths
with root beer and spun sugar, sod-roofed huts serving chicha,
chick-peas and roast guinea pig, street performers passing around the
hat and picking pockets—pea under the shell, now you see it now
you don't ... shift partners round and round—Malay youths with
krisses skewering religious women, shootist with custom-made Kenya
Special Police in his nostrils, southern lawmen are hacked to
Hollywood and gone, and a grinning boy passes around a bloody
Stetson.</p>

<p>	"Nominate your

<p>	Klansmen clutch their
throats and turn black.</p>

<p>	"We
don't serve niggers in here!" thunders the bartender. "Take

<p>	Boys in medieval
codpieces have set up a catapult. Roman soldiers break down doors
with battering rams, impervious to the bullets, which break against
clear classic light with a whiff of ozone.</p>

<p>	Raids and prisoners

carry the bitches away, screaming and kicking, an old western posse
is lynching a Neanderthal man, KGB and CIA agents bustle scientists

chopper like actors pulled offstage, Inquisition Police drag
jet-setters out of cocktail lounges, and the Green Guards are busy
with their nets.</p>

<p>	"Oh I want that
one ..." coos a courtier.</p>

<p>	Audrey leads an army
of twelve-year-old boys carrying banners of colored silk ...
POLTERGEISTS OF THE WORLD UNITE!</p>

<p>	They stand now, still
as stone, in a sickening uneasy calm. As the barometer drops and
drops, slowly a black cloud gathers over their heads. A little wind
stirs brown hair across the mouth, brown lilacs and brown hair,
ruffling through hair yellow as corn silk, through auburn, orange,
russet and flame-red hair and black Pan curls....</p><empty-line /><p>WIND		WIND		WIND</p><empty-line /><p>A sighing sound, a
whistle, a shriek, hair standing straight up now as a black funnel
whirls around their slender bodies tearing cobblestones up from the
street, screaming hurricanes of broken glass as the boys ride this
bucking whistling wind—it's known as a "space horse."
You let it carry you all the way out, glass blizzards stripping flesh
from bones, tossing bloody bones through the air with street signs
and branches, masonry, stones and timbers—the whole city is
flapping and shredding.</p>

<p>	Thousand-mile-an-hour
winds—the fences, barbed wire, and massive iron gates hemming
in the Casbah are tearing loose ... flying wire decapitates screaming
crowds. Pan, God of Panic, rides the wings of Death as the torn sky
bends with the wind, prop sky tearing, shredding—incandescent
force—the pure young purpose blazes like a comet....</p><empty-line /><p>WIND!	WIND!	WIND!</p><empty-line /><p>Audrey is in the eye of
the hurricane, a point of lucid calm. In front of him is a dusty tube
of Colgate toothpaste in the window of a Tangier shop.</p>

<p>	Far away he sees
Middletown: red brick houses, a deep clear stream, some bridges,
naked boys, high-pitched distant voices. A boy who looks familiar ...
he knows the boy's name but can't remember from where exactly ...
it's Dink ... Dink Rivers, the boy from Middletown.</p>

<p>	Now Dink waves and
beckons: "It's me, Audrey! I'm back!"</p>

<p>	Audrey tries to reach
him but the wind tosses Audrey about like a cork. He is fighting his
way upriver through breaking ice floes ... years tearing loose.</p>

<p>	The distant voice of
the pitchman: "The age-old story of Adam and Eve ..."</p>

<p>	Audrey finds himself
in the Fun City of his dream ... can't remember exactly ... pinwheels
... shooting galleries a rural slum ... rundown houses ... rubbish
... little fields of corn and cabbage ... blotched diseased faces ...
silent and intent ... all moving down a steep road of red clay ... no
one seems to see him.</p>

<p>	The road leads to a
rubbly square. In the middle of the square is a platform built around
a tree.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>Argue second time</p>

<p>around such a deal</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>On the platform is Arn
as Eve with long red hair, her body covered with fever blotches. A
naked youth with long yellow hair is Adam. The fever smell steams off
their naked bodies and the crowd draws the smell in, whimpering and
rubbing themselves.</p>

<p>	Something familiar
about Adam, Audrey thinks. Reminds him of something a long time ago.
Why ... it's me!</p>

<p>	Now
Arn proffers Adam an apple. The fruit is purple-red and shiny like
the head of a penis. Here and there on the fruit are triangular
bulges like Adam's apples and at one end is a russet rectum. <emphasis>Why
it's made of male flesh</emphasis>, Audrey thinks.</p>

<p>	<emphasis>"No!
No!"</emphasis> Audrey screams without a throat, without a tongue.</p>

<p>	Adam does not hear.
His face wears an appalling expression of idiotic ecstasy as he bites
into the apple. Audrey can feel the sugary burning-metal taste down
to his quivering toes as Arn rises from his side tearing loose ...
the sweet diseased knowledge.</p>

<p>	Eve
stands there with a noose ... bone's song burning marbled cream
smashed roses ... old story of Adam and Eve ... how Eve was <emphasis>made</emphasis>.
<emphasis>Knowledge</emphasis> of the blackout ... Black Jack's Apple Tree ...
fruit made of the boy's death dangling there. It's a lovely tree,
isn't it? Nets of the Green Guards fall over Audrey's head.</p>

<p>	By noon of the third
day, General Darg is ready to surrender. Knowing the treatment meted
out to defeated generals in Yass-Waddah, he calculates how he can get
a better deal from Dimitri. The insurgents are now in control of
Ba'dan, or what is left of it. Considering the terrible fate awaiting
prisoners taken by the Green Guards during the battle, Dimitri
launches an immediate all-out assault on Yass-Waddah.</p><empty-line /><p>Audrey
has been captured by the Green Guards and brought to the Countess de
Gulpa's palace. She isn't going to share <emphasis>this</emphasis> with the
courtiers.</p>

<p>	"Hello, Audrey, I
am very glad to see you here." She smiles and licks her lips,
her eyes glowing with green fire. "Let me show you around."</p>

<p>	Two massive guards
flank him on either side and two walk behind. Through electrodes
implanted in their brains they are telepathically controlled by the
Countess.</p>

<p>	"I'll show you my
conservatory, Audrey. I'm sure you will find it interesting."</p>

<p>	She leads the way into
a red-carpeted room. There is a plastic sheet across one end where
plants are growing. A horrible black smell of filth and evil fills
the room, a smell of insects and rotten flowers, of unknown
secretions and excrements.</p>

<p>	"Come along, I'll
show you my little plants." She stands at one end of the plastic
screen, which is open and leads to a narrow path that encircles the
garden. "Look there, Audrey."</p>

<p>	Audrey sees a pink
shaft growing from the ground, a penis-shaped shaft, red and purple,
and as he watches, the shaft moves and pulses. The Countess leans
forwards with a hoe and turns the plant out of the ground. The shaft
is attached to a pink sac with insect legs like a scorpion or a
centipede. It scrabbles to cover itself up with dirt.</p>

<p>	"That was once a
silly boy like you, Audrey, and that's where I'm going to plant you."
The Countess stands with her hand on the door. "You'll find out
how it's done, Audrey. You'll have six hours to learn."</p>

<p>	The courtiers,
lounging on a colonnade high above the river, see a flotilla of
boats, rafts, and landing barges approaching. This must be General
Darg returning in triumph with hundreds of captives. They squirm and
moan in vile anticipation, stretching forth languid fingers to a
basket of golden figs warmed by the noon sun.</p>

<p>	"My
God, something's <emphasis>up</emphasis> me!"</p>

<p>	The principal defense
of Yass-Waddah are the towers, manned by a few skilled technicians,
capable of throwing electric blasts like lightning bolts. Now the
towers open fire, blowing boats out of the water.</p>

<p>	The insurgents take
heavy losses but they spread out and keep coming. Landings have been
made all up and down the river and Yass-Waddah is surrounded by
confused troops without a plan of attack.</p>

<p>	The Cyclops Boys go
into action. These beings have one eye in the center of the forehead.
They can activate the death chakra in the back of the neck until a
laser boom shoots out the third eye, cutting through stone and metal,
seeking the electronic control centers of the city.</p>

<p>	Instrument panels are
blowing out, magazines exploding. The screaming crowd pours through
the walls, now broken in many places.</p>

<p>	"Death to the
Council of the Selected!"</p>

<p>	"Death to the
Green Guards!"</p>

<p>	"Death to the
Foreign Sows!"</p>

<p>	"Death to the
Courtiers!"</p>

<p>	But the courtiers are
deaf to everything but their own screams as the kundu do their work.</p>

<p>	Audrey felt the floor
shift under his feet and he was standing at the epicenter of a vast
web. In that moment, he knew its purpose, knew the reason for
suffering, fear, sex, and death. It was all intended to keep human
slaves imprisoned in physical bodies while a monstrous matador waved
his cloth in the sky, sword ready for the kill.</p>

<p>	From the depth of his
horror and despair, something was breaking through like molten lava,
a shock wave of uncontrollable energy. Audrey felt the chakra at the
back of his neck light up and glow like a tiny crystal skull brighter
and brighter. A hum filled the room and a smell of ozone.</p>

<p>	The Countess turned
from the door, eyes blazing with alertness, and Audrey saw what had
happened. He orders to the guards had not been obeyed. An interfering
frequency had blanked out her control of them.</p>

<p>	Audrey smiled and
licked his lips. He started forward, hands outstretched to block a
groin kick. The Countess screamed like an animal, dodged past him and
out the door.</p>

<p>	He was a step behind
her as she sprinted down the corridor. He ran with inhuman speed,
taking twenty feet at a stride and caught her at the end of the hall.
He held he elbows pinioned, his hip against her, and grinned into her
screaming face, which was losing all human semblance as he smashed
her against the wall and threw his hammer-fist into her face,
crushing the perfectly chiseled nose and lips that that crumpled like
rubber.</p>

<p>	Now he was clawing out
her eyes, which were blank and white and rubbery. Someone was shaking
his shoulder.</p>

<p>	"Mr. Carsons,
what are you doing? Why, you're waking up the whole ward."</p>

<p>	Audrey found himself
looking at a ruptured pillow. A nurse stood over him.</p>

<p>	"Just look what
you've done. You've torn your pillow to pieces." She snatched
the pillow from his hands and bustled out.</p>

<p>	The nurse returned
with a new pillow. She straightened the bed and put the pillow under
his head in a way that said, See that it stays there. She looked at
her wristwatch. "I'll get you an injection."</p>

<p>	Audrey lay back
looking at the ceiling. He felt calm and relaxed. He must have had a
nightmare. He couldn't remember what it was and it all seemed very
remote and unimportant. Just a pillow. Well, he had a new pillow now.
The nurse was back with a hypo on a little silver tray. He rolled
back his sleeve, felt the alcohol on his arm—and the prick of
the needle. GOM one quarter grain.</p>

<p>	He woke in gray
dawnlight and lay there trying to remember. When had it all started?
In London with Jerry Green and John Everson. His first real habit.</p>

<p>	He had chippied around
in New York with cut shit but this was pure H dispensed by a woman
doctor with a title. The Countess, they called her. If she liked you
she would write for any amount of heroin and coke or both. She liked
the "boys," as she called them.</p>

<p>	Then, suddenly, the
terrible news. The Countess was dead of a heart attack. The Home
Office was clamping down. Time to move.</p>

<p>	So Audrey, Jerry and
John set out for Katmandu in a second-hand car that got them as far
as Trieste, where they took a boat arriving in Athens in the middle
of the summer.</p>

<p>	The boat was like an
oven. They finally found quarters in a hostel: a bare room with three
cots. The proprietor had inquisitive unpleasant eyes. Everything
about him said "police informer." But they were thin and
the room was cooler than the street. The boys stripped to their
underwear and sat down on the cots.</p>

<p>	"I feel
terrible," said Audrey.</p>

<p>	"I got some kinda
awful hives," said Jerry scratching at a red welt on his ribs.</p>

<p>	"Probably just
the heat and being sick," said John. "Let's see what we've
got left." He stood up and swayed and put a hand to his
forehead.</p>

<p>	Audrey stood up to
steady him and silver spots boiled in front of his eyes. They both
sat down again, then got up very slowly and took a little Chinese H
and some cotton from the knapsacks. They cooked it all together and
split it.</p>

<p>	Ten minutes later,
Audrey was down with Cotton Fever. Teeth chattering, his whole body
shaking, he lay on the bed, knees up to his chin, hands clenched in
front of his face.</p>

<p>	Finally, he got two
Nembutals down and the shivering stopped. He went to sleep.</p>

<p>	He dreamed he was back
in Saint Louis as a child. He was eating orange ice very fast for the
sharp headache and the relief that comes from sipping a little water.
Just as he reached for the water, he woke up with a pounding searing
headache, his body burning with fever. He knew that he was very sick,
perhaps dying.</p>

<p>	He tried to get up and
fell on his knees by Jerry's bed. He shook Jerry's shoulder. The
flesh was burning-hot. Jerry muttered something.</p>

<p>	"Wake up, Jerry.
We have to get help."</p>

<p>	The door opened. The
light was turned on. Three Greek cops and the proprietor were
watching from the doorway. The cops pointed to the boys and said
something in excited Greek. They backed out of the room stuffing
handkerchiefs in front of their faces. Leaving once cop at the door,
they called an ambulance.</p>

<p>	Audrey vaguely
remembered being lifted onto a stretcher by masked figures. As he was
carried down the stairs, he saw words in front of his eyes: a lattice
of black words on white paper shifting and rotating. He could make
out the first sentence:</p>

<p>	"The name is Clem
Snide. I am a private asshole."</p>

<p>	The nurse stood by his
bed with a thermometer. She put it in his mouth and left the room.
She came back with a breakfast tray. She drew out the thermometer and
looked at it. "Well, almost down to normal now."</p>

<p>	Audrey sat up in bed,
drank the orange juice greedily, ate a boiled egg and a piece of
toast and was drinking his coffee when Doctor Dimitri came in. The
face looked familiar and seemed to stir and concentrate the vague
shapes of the dream. Of course, Audrey thought. I've been delirious
and he was the doctor.</p>

<p>	"Well, I see
you're a lot better. You should be out of here in a few days now."</p>

<p>	"How long have I
been here?"</p>

<p>	"Ten days. You've
been very sick."</p>

<p>	"What was it?"</p>

<p>	"Don't know
exactly ... a virus ... new ones keep turning up. We thought at first
it was scarlet fever but when there was no reaction to antibiotics,
we shifted to purely symptomatic treatment. I don't mind telling you
it was a close thing ... temperatures up to a hundred and six ...
your two friends are here ... exactly the same syndrome."</p>

<p>	"And I've been
delirious all this time?"</p>

<p>	"Completely. Do
you remember any of it?"</p>

<p>	"Last thing I
remember is being carried out of the hostel."</p>

<p>	"The remarkable
thing is that you, Jerry, and John all seemed to be in the same
delirium. I've made a few notes...." He flipped open a small
loose-leaf notebook. "Does this mean anything to you? Tamaghis
... Ba'dan ... Yass-Waddah ... Waghdas ... Naufana ... or Ghadis?"</p>

<p>	"No."</p>

<p>	"Cities of the
Red Night?"</p>

<p>	Audrey glimpsed a red
sky and mud walls .... "Just a flash."</p>

<p>	"And now, there
is the matter of my fee."</p>

<p>	"My father will
pay you."</p>

<p>	"He has already
agreed to do so but he has refused to pay the hospital costs—pleading
his income tax. This is awkward. However, if you will sign an
agreement to pay ... your father suggests that you apply to the
American Embassy for repatriation...."</p>

<p>*</p>

<p>The boys are at the
reception desk of the hospital, signing papers. Doctor Dimitri stands
there in a dark suit.</p>

<p>	Audrey looks around:
something very strange about this hospital ... for one thing, no one
seems to be wearing white uniforms. Perhaps, he thinks
egocentrically, they are all waiting for us to go home so they can
leave—but then another shift would be coming on. In fact, he
decides, this doesn't look like a hospital at all ... more like the
American Embassy.</p>

<p>	A cab pulls up under
the portico. Doctor Dimitri shakes hands with a rapidly disappearing
smile.</p>

<p>	As soon as the boys
are gone, he walks through a series of doors, each guarded by an
armed security man who nods him through.</p>

<p>	He is in a room with a
computer panel attached to a battery of tape recorders. He flicks a
switch.</p>

<p>	"The Consul will
see you now."</p>

<p>	A black wooden slate
on the desk said "Mr. Pierson." The Consul was a thin young
man in a gray seersucker suit with an ascetic disdainful Wasp face
and very cold gray eyes.</p>

<p>	He stood up, shook
hands without smiling, and motioned the three boys to chairs. He
spoke in a cultivated academic voice from which all traces of warmth
had been carefully excised. "You realize that there is a
considerable hospital bill outstanding?"</p>

<p>	"We have signed
an agreement to pay."</p>

<p>	"The Greek
authorities could prevent you from leaving the country."</p>

<p>	The three boys spoke
at once:</p>

<p>	Audrey: "It
wasn't our fault...."</p>

<p>	Jerry: "We got
sick...."</p>

<p>	John: "It was
..."</p>

<p>	Audrey: "A virus
..."</p>

<p>	Jerry: "A new
virus." He smiled seductively at the Consul, who did not smile
back.</p>

<p>	All together: "We
almost died!" They rolled their eyes back and made a
death-rattle sound.</p>

<p>	"The police found
evidence of drug-taking in your room. You are lucky not to be in
jail."</p>

<p>	"We're certainly
grateful to you, Mr. Pierson. And lucky to be here—like you
say," said Audrey. He tried to sound impulsive and boyish but it
came out all slimy and insinuating.</p>

<p>	The others nodded in
agreement.</p>

<p>	"Don't
thank me," said the Consul dryly. "It was Doctor Dimitri
who put in a word with the police. He is interested in your <emphasis>case</emphasis>.
A new virus, it seems...." He looked at the boys severely, as if
they had committed some gross breach of decorum.</p>

<p>	"Doctor Dimitri
is quite an influential man."</p>

<p>	All together,
plaintively: "We want to go home."</p>

<p>	"I daresay. And
who will pay for it?"</p>

<p>	"We will—when
we can," said Audrey.</p>

<p>	The others nodded in
agreement.</p>

<p>	"And when will
that be? Have you ever thought about working?" asked Mr.
Pierson.</p>

<p>	"Thought about
it," said Audrey.</p>

<p>	"In an abstract
sort of way ..." said Jerry.</p>

<p>	"Like death and
old age ..." said John.</p>

<p>	"Doesn't happen
to people one knows..." said Audrey feeling like a Fitzgerald
character. The sun came out from behind a cloud and filled the room
with light.</p>

<p>	The
Consul leaned forward and spoke in confidential tones. "For
example ... for <emphasis>example</emphasis> ... you could <emphasis>work</emphasis> your way
home. There's a ship in Piraeus now that can use three deckhands. Any
sailing experience?"</p>

<p>	"Reef the
mizzenmast!" said Audrey.</p>

<p>	"Scuttle the
bilge!" said John.</p>

<p>	"And pour hot tar
on the companionway!" said Jerry.</p>

<p>	"Good."
The Consul wrote something down on a slip of paper and passed it to
Audrey. "When you get to <emphasis>The Billy Celeste</emphasis>, ask for
Captain Nordenholz."</p>

<p>	The boys stood up and
said in chorus: "Thank you, Mr. Pierson." They flashed
toothpaste smiles.</p>

<p>	Mr. Pierson looked
down at his desk and said nothing. The boys walked out.</p>

<p>	As he stepped out of
the office, Audrey got a whiff of that unmistakable hospital smell. A
young man in a white coat was chatting with a nurse at the reception
desk. A taxi pulled up for them at the door.</p>

<p>	In the office, Doctor
Pierson picked up the phone: "Doctor Pierson here.... Yes, no
question about it." He picked up the slides and studied them.
"B-23 all right.... The boy Jerry is obviously the original
carrier.... Active? Like a plutonium pile....There is, of course, the
uh delicate and sensitive question of differential racial or ethnic
susceptibility ... with further research, perhaps ... Could not
commit myself on the basis of present findings ... theoretically
possible, of course. On the other hand, uncontrolled mutation cannot
be ruled out ... sure? How can I be sure? After all it's not in my
district."</p><empty-line /><p>Late
afternoon in the cabin of <emphasis>The Billy Celeste</emphasis>. Audrey and the
boys have just signed on.</p>

<p>	Skipper Nordenholz
glanced down at the names. "Well uh Jerry, Audrey, and John ...
you have made a wise choice. I hope you are quite fit?"</p>

<p>	"Oh yes,
Captain."</p>

<p>	"Aye,
aye, sir."</p>

<p>	"The
doctor said we made a <emphasis>remarkable</emphasis> recovery."</p>

<p>	"Good.
We will be sailing within the hour.... Tunis, Gibraltar ... Lisbon
for Halifax. Incidentally, we will be passing the exact spot off the
Azores where <emphasis>The Mary Celeste</emphasis> was found in 1872—all
sails set, completely undamaged, nobody on board." His green
eyes glinted with irony and he smiled slightly and added, "The
mystery was never solved."</p>

<p>	"Perhaps it was
just the basic mystery of life, Skipper," Audrey added cheekily.
"Now you see it—now you don't."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>Minutes to go</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>We call ourselves the
Destroying Angels. Our target is the rear-end of Yass-Waddah, if it
could be said to have one. We feel rather like the Light Brigade. All
the bad characters of history are gathered in Yass-Waddah for a
last-ditch stand: the Countess de Gulpa, heavy and cold as a fish
under tons of gray shale; the Countess de Vile, eyes glowing, face
flushed from the ecstasy of torture; the Ugly Spirit; the Black
Abbot; and the Council of the Selected—all with their guards
and minions and torture chambers. How can we prevail against this
wall of icy purpose?</p>

<p>	We got the message on
the teleflash from Ba'dan. Yass-Waddah has completed nuclear device
ahead of schedule. All-out aid requested.</p>

<p>	We are still 150 miles
from Yass-Waddah. Four days hard marching. We don't have that much
time.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>We are here because</p>

<p>of you</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>Woke up in the silent
wolf lope. There is the river. No sign of Yass-Waddah. I must be
above or below it.</p>

<p>	I reach the bank.
Across the river I can see the rotting piers and sheds of East
Ba'dan. To my right is what remains of a bridge, the upper structure
rotted away, leaving only the piles protruding from green water.</p>

<p>	I am standing where
Yass-Waddah used to be. The water looks green and cold and dirty and
curiously artificial, like a diorama in the Museum of Natural
History.</p>

<p>	A blond boy enters
from my right where the bridge used to be, walking on the green-brown
water. He moves with a stalking gait as if he were playing some part
in a play, mimicking some actor with a touch of parody.</p>

<p>	The boy is wearing a
white T-shirt with a yellow calligram on the chest surrounded by a
circle of yellow light, rainbow-colored at the edges. He is weaing
white gym shorts and white tennis shoes.</p>

<p>	A dark boy in
identical white gym clothes is standing to my left on the bank at the
top of a grassy hillock. He has planted a banner in the ground beside
him and holds the shaft with one hand. The banner is the calligram in
the rainbow circle stirring gently in a wind that ruffles his shorts
around smooth white thighs.</p>

<p>	The blond boy walks up
from the water and stands in front of his dark twin. The dark boys
begins to talk in soft flute calls, clean and sweet and joyful with a
sound like laughter, wind in the trees, birds at dawn, trickling
streams. The blond boy answers in the same language, sweetly inhuman
voices from a distant star.</p>

<p>	Now I recognize the
dark boy as Dink Rivers, the boy from Middletown, and the other as
myself. This is a high school play. We have just taken the west side
of the river. This is the conquest of Yass-Waddah.</p>

<p>	Good evening, our
chap. A good crossing. Yass-Waddah disintegrated.</p>

<p>	A slow insouciant
shrug of rocks and stones and trees spreads a golf course along the
river now several hundred yards away. Two caddies stand in a sand
trap. One rubs his crotch and the other makes a jack-off gesture.
Music from the country club on a gust of wind. Red brick buildings,
cobblestone streets. It is getting darker. Dusty ticket booth.</p>

<p>	A sign:</p>

<p>The Billy
Celeste High School presents:</p>

<p>CITIES OF
THE RED NIGHT</p><empty-line /><p>I lead the way through
rooms stacked with furniture and paintings, passageways, partitions,
stairways, booths, cubicles, elevators, ramps and ladders, trunks
full of costumes and old weapons, bathtubs, toilets, steam rooms, and
rooms open in front....</p>

<p>	A boy jacks off on a
yellow toilet seat...catcalls and scattered applause.</p>

<p>	We are in a
cobblestone alley. I look at my companion. He is about eighteen. He
has large brown eyes with amber pupils, set to the side of his face,
and a long straight Mayan nose. He is dressed in
blue-and-brown-striped pants and shirt.</p>

<p>	I open a rusty padlock
into my father's workshop. We strip and straddle a pirate chest,
facing each other. His skin is a deep brownish-purple gray
underneath. A sharp musty smell pulses from his erect phallus with
its smooth purple head. His eyes converge on me like a lizard's.</p>

<p>	"What scene do
you want me to act in?"</p>

<p>	"Death Baby fucks
the Corn God."</p>

<p>	We open the chest. He
takes out a necklace of crystal skulls and puts it on. There is a
reek of decay as he drapes me in the golden flesh of the young Corn
God.</p>

<p>	We are in a vast
loft-attic-gymnasium-warehouse. There are chests and trunks,
costumes, mirrors, and makeup. Boys are taking out costumes, trying
them on, posing and giggling in front of mirror, moving props and
backdrops.</p>

<p>	The warehouse seems
endless. A maze of rooms and streets, cafés, courtyards and
gardens. Farm rooms, with walnut bedsteads and hooked rugs, open onto
a pond where boys fish naked on an improvised raft. A Moroccan patio
is animated with sand foxes and a boy playing a flute ... stars like
wilted gardenias across the blue night sky.</p>

<p>	A number of
performances are going on at the same time, in many rooms, on many
levels. The spectators circulate from one stage to another, putting
on costumes and makeup to join a performance and the performers all
move from one stage to another. There are moving stages and floats,
platforms that descend from the ceiling on pulleys, doors that pop
open, and partitions that slide back.</p>

<p>	Audrey, naked except
for a sailor hat, is tipped back balancing in a chair while he reads
a comic book entitled: "Audrey and the Pirates."</p>

<p>	Jerry comes in naked
with an envelope sealed with red wax.</p>

<p>	"Open it and read
it to me."</p>

<p>	Oh sir, it's battle
orders."</p>

<p>	"Wheeeeeeeeeeee!"
Audrey ejaculates.</p>

<p>	On deck, naked tars
throw their hats into the air jacking off and leaping on each other
like randy dogs: "Wheeeeeeeeeeeeeee!" They scramble into
uniforms as bugles call them to battle stations.</p><empty-line /><p><emphasis>The
Fever:</emphasis> A red silk curtain scented with rose oil, musk, sperm,
rectal mucus, ozone and raw meat goes up on a hospital ward of boys
covered with phosphorescent red blotches that glow and steam the
fever smell off them, shuddering, squirming, shivering, eyes burning,
legs up, teeth bare, whispering the ancient evil fever words.</p>

<p>	Doctor
Pierson covers his face with a handkerchief. <emphasis>"Get it out of
here!"</emphasis></p>

<p>	Yen Lee looks at a
painted village with his binoculars. Taped voice: "We see Tibet
with the binoculars of the people."</p>

<p>	In a stone hut, a
naked boy lies on a filthy pallet. Bright red luminescent
flesh-clusters glow in the dark room. He rubs the clusters with a
slow idiot smile and ejaculates.</p>

<p>	Yen Lee sags against a
wall with a handkerchief in front of his face.</p>

<p>	<emphasis>"It's
the pickle factory."</emphasis></p>

<p>	"A health officer
is on the way."</p>

<p>	The Health Officer is
on the nod on his porch over a sluggish river. The huge bloated
corpse of a dead hippopotamus floats slowly by. The Health Officer is
oblivious. Taped voice: "For he had a sustaining vice." On
a riverbank with Ali standing over him, he looks with horror at his
torn pocket and empty hand. Backdrop shifts to another bank. With the
same expression, Farnsworth looks down at his naked body covered with
red welts. Ali stands over him smiling, the red welts a dusky rose
color on his reddish-brown skin.</p>

<p>	Marine band plays
"Semper Fi."</p>

<p>	Picture
of a privy on a door with a bronze eye under the sickle moon. Audrey,
as Clem Snide the private eye, is sitting in a sunken room open at
the top. The audience is looking down into the room so they can see
what he is looking at: photos of Jerry—baby pictures ... age
fourteen holding up a string of cutthroat trout ... naked with a
hard-on ... Jerry live onstage, naked with his hands tied, face and
body covered with red blotches, a baneful red glow behind him. He is
looking at something in front of him as his penis stirs and stiffens.
Scattered applause and <emphasis>olés</emphasis> from the audience.</p>

<p>	Banner headlines in
red letters: MYSTERY ILLNESS SPREADS.</p>

<p>	On a hospital bed,
Jerry spreads his legs with a slow wallowing movement, showing his
bright red asshole glowing, pulsing, and crinkling like a randy
mollusk. He twists his head to the right, eyes spluttering green
flashes as he hangs.</p>

<p>	A sepia cutback to the
hospital bed. He ejaculates, kicking his legs in the air. Jimmy Lee,
as a male nurse, catches his sperm in a jar.</p>

<p>	Thunderous
applause ... <emphasis>"Olé! </emphasis><emphasis>Olé!
Olé!"</emphasis></p>

<p>	The
jar is passed to four Marine guards and rushed to a top-secret lab. A
scientist looks through a microscope. He gives the OK sign.</p>

<p>	Bouquets of roses rain

<p>	A diseased face with a

lantern....</p>

<p>	"The world's

<p>	Boys
on snowshoes reach the <emphasis>haman</emphasis>. Steam and naked bodies fade to a
misty waterfront. Opium Jones is there with patches of frost on his
face as the boys sign on in the ghostly cabin of <emphasis>The Great White</emphasis>.</p>

<p>	Dinner at the
Pembertons. Candlelight on faces that suggest madeup corpses. Only
Noah, his boyish face flushed, looks alive. The conversation is
enigmatic.</p>

<p>	"Are they doing
mummies to standard?"</p>

<p>	"This is the
aunt's language."</p>

<p>	"We still don't
have the nouns."</p>

<p>	"You need black

<p>	The

brings them out on deck. Jerry, with a noose around his neck, grins a
wolfish smile. Then he hands, as the western sky lights up with the
green flash.</p><empty-line /><p><emphasis>Captured

English manor house lights up. A picture on the wall shows an old
gentleman wrapped in red shawls and scarves propped up in bed, with
laudanum, medicine glass, tea, scones, and books on the night table
beside him. Taking to his bed for the winter....</p>

<p>	A light shines on a
huge four-poster bed. A man with a nightcap sits up suddenly. A naked
radiant boy is standing at the foot of his bed. The man gasps,
chokes, turns bright red and dies of apoplexy, blood gushing from his
mouth and nose.</p><empty-line /><p><emphasis>Cities
of the Red Night:</emphasis> Spotlights bathe the papier-mâché
walls in red light. The boys camp around putting on disease makeup.
Juanito, the Master of Ceremonies, puts a red rubber flesh-cluster in
his navel.</p>

<p>	"My dear, you
look like Venus de Milo with a clock in her stomach."</p>

<p>	The boys pose with
expressions of idiot lust. The spectators roll on the floor laughing.
One turns blue in the face.</p>

<p>	<emphasis>"Cyanide
reaction! Medics on the double!"</emphasis></p>

<p>	Boys in white coats
rush in and shoot him with a blackout dart.</p>

<p>	Piper Boy with a
bamboo flute in Lima ... blue sky, color of his eyes. Smell of the
sea. Dink is fucking Noah who turns into Audrey and Billy.</p>

<p>	"It's me! It's
me! I've landed! Hi, Bill! It's two hundred years, Bill! I've
landed!"</p>

<p>	The pilgrimage may
take many lifetimes. In many rooms, on many levels, the ancient
whispering stage ...</p>

<p>	Moving age with his
binoculars, Audrey lays back in a chair masturbating. Bright pirates.
Jerry comes in red wax. We see Tibet for a few seconds, people. A
sepia cutback to the hospital. Depraved smile, sperm in a beaker.</p>

<p>	He plays "Semper
Fi" to four Marine guards. Baby pictures declared in red letters
of cutthroat trout. Red anticipation of fever drifts from the bed.
See what he is looking at onstage.</p>

<p>	National Emergency,
age fifteen, holds up a string of stoplights. Jerry's radiant ghost
may take many lifetimes. Jerry, the cabin boy, stands over the hills
and far away.</p>

<p>	"Lima, flash,
it's me. The Piper Boy in Lima. Dink, I've landed. Long way to find
you."</p>

<p>	Noah is in the library
studying diagrams of mortars and grenades. He is drawing a cannon. A
Chinese child in the doorway throws a firecracker underneath his
chair. As the firecracker explodes, the cannon barrel tilts up at an
angle. A backdrop of burning galleons falls in front of him.</p>

<p>	Audrey's boys are back
on deck. Gas tank explodes in Tamaghis. Flintlock rifle on the
library table. Hans and Noah take off their shorts.</p>

<p>	<emphasis>"Wenn
nicht von vorn denn von hintern herum."</emphasis>
If not from the front then around by the
back way.</p>

<p>	As Noah bends over,
the flintlock breaks at the breech. As Noah ejaculates,
breech-loading rifles pour withering fire into a column of Spanish
soldiers.</p>

<p>	A
float of a Spanish galleon moves slowly and ponderously across the
gymnasium floor. On the deck, we see the Inquisition with stakes and
garrotes, the Conquistadores, the patróns and governors,
officers and bureaucrats and their modern equivalents, <emphasis>machos</emphasis>
and <emphasis>politicos</emphasis> swilling Old Parr scotch and brandishing
pearl-handled 45s.</p>

<p>	Immigration
police in dark glasses ... <emphasis>"Pasaporte ... Documentos ..."</emphasis></p>

<p>	Kelly
as Ah Pook, spattered with black spots of decay, is fucking the young
Corn God in a pirate's chest overflowing with gold ducats and pieces
of eight. As they come, a yellow haze like gaseous gold streams off
them and wafts across the deck of the galleon. <emphasis>Machos</emphasis> clutch
their throats, spit blood, and die.</p>

<p>	Noah hangs ejaculating
in the same yellow haze of magical intention. The curtain is drawn
for a moment and guns are piled up in front of him—from his
first cartridge rifle to M-16s and bazookas, rocket guns and field
pieces.</p>

<p>	He is lowered with a
slow sinuous movement by the Juicy-Fruit Twins. The twins are naked
except for their sailor hats and white sneakers.</p>

<p>	Offstage,
a voice bellows: "<emphasis>All right, you jokers</emphasis>.... Battle
stations."</p>

<p>	Noah and the twins are
in the gun turret making calculations, taking the range....</p>

<p>	"Yards:
twenty-three thousand ... Elevation: point six ..."</p>

<p>	The galleon is in the
cross hairs of the sight. Jerry turns bright red as he presses the
Fire button. The galleon blows up and sinks into a prop sea.</p>

<p>	Panorama of Mexico,
Central and South America ... music and singing ... naked Spanish
soldiers washing in a courtyard, jetting the soap around like a
soccer ball and tackling each other, washing each other's backs. In
trees by a river boys with idiot expressions jack off, snapping and
gurgling like fish as they shake fruit into the water.</p>

<p>	Audrey is naked
against a backdrop of jungle and ruined pyramids. He gets a hard-on
and levitates as it comes up. He lands from a hang-glider in a red
desert.</p>

<p>	Jerry, the cabin boy,
meets him in a lizard suit that leaves his crotch and ass naked. "Me
lizard boy ... very good for fuck." Rainbow colors play over his
body.</p>

<p>	Spanish
galleon ... movement by the Juicy-Fruit Twins ... on the deck we see
white sneakers ... bureaucrats calculating the range ... hand hair
turns bright red on Fire button ... The Galleon <emphasis>Pasaporte
Documentos</emphasis> is blown out of the water and so a vast territory as
Ah Pook spatters the panorama with insurgents. All the boys in yellow
haze of skintight magic transparent for a moment come to attention in
a line from the first cartridge gun to M-16s ... naked haze like gold
gas....</p>

<p>	"TENSHUN!"</p>

<p>	Audrey and Noah
ejaculating angels in rainbow intention....</p>

<p>	"AT EASE."</p>

<p>	Naked soldiers sniff
bazookas and field pieces....</p>

<p>	Peace does not last
forever....</p>

<p>	Red Night in Tamaghis.
The boys dance around a fire, throwing in screaming Sirens. The boys
trill, wave nooses, and stick their tongues out.</p>

<p>	This was but a prelude
to the Ba'dan riots and the attack on Yass-Waddah. The boys change
costumes, rushing from stage to stage.</p>

<p>	The Iguana twins dance
out of an Angkor Wat—Uxmal—Tenochtitlán set. The
"female" twin peels off his cunt suit and they replicate a
column of Viet Cong.</p>

<p>	The Countess, with a
luminous-dial alarm clock ticking in her stomach and crocodiles mask,
stalks Audrey with her courtiers and Green Guards. Police Boy shoots
a Green Guard. Clinch Todd as Death with a scythe decapitates the
Goddess Bast.</p>

<p>	Jon Allistair
Peterson, in a pink shirt with sleeve garters, stands on a platform
draped with the Star-Spangled Banner and the Union Jack. Standing on
the platform with him is Nimun in an ankle-length cloak made from the
skin of electric eels.</p>

<p>	The Board enters and
takes their place in a section for parents and faculty.</p>

<p>	Peterson speaks:
"Ladies and gentlemen, this character is the only survivor of a
very ancient race with very strange powers. Now some of you may be
taken aback by this character...."</p>

<p>	Nimun drops off his
robe and stands naked. An ammoniacal fishy odor reeks off his body—a
smell of some artifact for a forgotten function or a function not yet
possible. His body is a terra-cotta red color with black freckles
like holes in the flesh.</p>

<p>	"And I may tell
you in strictest confidence that he and he alone is responsible for
the Red Night...."</p>

<p>	Jon Peterson gets
younger and turns into the Piper Boy. He draws a flute from a
goatskin sheath at his belt and starts to play. Nimun does a
shuffling sinuous dance singing in a harsh fish language that tears
the throat like sandpaper.</p>

<p>	With a cry that seems
to implode into his lungs, he throws himself backward onto a hassock,
legs in the air, seizing his ankles with both hands. His exposed
rectum is jet-black surrounded by erectile red hairs. The hole begins
to spin with a smell of ozone and hot iron. And his body is spinning
like a top, faster and faster, floating in the air above the cushion,
transparent and fading, as the red sky flares behind him.</p>

<p>	A courtier feels the
perfume draining off him....</p>

<p>	<emphasis>"Itza
..."</emphasis></p>

<p><emphasis>	</emphasis>A
Board member opens his moth.... <emphasis>"Itza ..."</emphasis> His false
teeth fly out.</p>

<p>	Wigs, clothes, chairs,
props, are all draining into the spinning black disk.</p>

<p>	"ITZA BLACK
HOLE!!"</p>

<p>	Naked bodies are
sucked inexorably forward, writhing screaming like souls pulled into
Hell. The lights go out and then the red sky....</p>

<p>	Lights come on to show
the ruins of Ba'dan. Children play in the Casbah tunnels, posing for
photos taken by German tourists with rucksacks. The old city is
deserted.</p>

<p>	A few miles upriver
there is a small fishing and hunting village. Here, pilgrims can rest
and outfit themselves for the journey that lies ahead.</p>

<p>	But what of
Yass-Waddah? Not a stone remains of the ancient citadel. The narrator
shoves his mike at the natives who lounge in front of rundown sheds
and fish from ruined piers. They shake their heads.</p>

<p>	"Ask Old Man
Brink. He'll know if anybody does."</p>

<p>	Old Man Brink is
mending a fish trap. Is it Waring or Noah Blake?</p>

<p>	"Yass-Waddah?"</p>

<p>	He says that many
years ago, a god dreamed Yass-Waddah. The old man puts his palms
together and rests his head on his hands, closing his eyes. He opens
his eyes and turns his hands out. "But the dream did not please
the god. So when he woke up—Yass-Waddah was gone."</p>

<p>	A painting on a
screen. Sign pointing: WAGHDAS-NAUFANA-GHADIS. Road winding into the
distance. Over the hills and far away....</p>

<p>	Audrey
sits at a typewriter in his attic room, his back to the audience. In
a bookcase to his left, we see <emphasis>The Book of Knowledge</emphasis>, <emphasis>Coming
of Age in Samoa</emphasis>, <emphasis>The Green Hat</emphasis>, <emphasis>The Plastic Age</emphasis>,
<emphasis>All the Sad Young Men</emphasis>, <emphasis>Bar Twenty Days</emphasis>, <emphasis>Amazing
Stories</emphasis>, <emphasis>Weird Tales</emphasis>, <emphasis>Adventure Stories</emphasis> and a stack
of <emphasis>Little Blue Books</emphasis>. In front of him is the etching depicting
Captain Strobe on the gallows. Audrey glances up at the picture and
types:</p><empty-line /><p>"The Rescue."</p><empty-line /><p>An explosion rumbles
through the warehouse. Walls and roof shake and fall on Audrey and
the audience. As the warehouse collapses, it turns to dust.</p>

<p>	The entire cast is
standing in a desert landscape looking at the sunset spread across
the western sky like a vast painting: the red walls of Tamaghis, the
Ba'dan riots, the smoldering ruins of Yass-Waddah and Manhattan,
Waghdas glimmers in the distance.</p>

<p>	The scenes shift and
change: tropical seas and green islands, a burning galleon sinks into
a gray-blue sea of clouds, rivers, jungles, villages, Greek temples
and there are the white frame houses of Harbor Point above the blue
lake.</p>

<p>	Port Roger shaking in
the wind, fireworks displays against a luminous green sky, expanses
of snow, swamps, and deserts where vast red mesas tower into the sky,
fragile aircraft over burning cities, flaming arrows, dimming to
mauves and grays and finally—in a last burst of light—the
enigmatic face of Waring as his eyes light up in a blue flash. He
bows three times and disappears into the gathering dusk.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>Return to Port Roger</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>This
must be it. Warped planks in a tangle of trees and vines. The pool of
the Palace is covered with algae. A snake slithers into the green
water. Weeds grow through the rusty shell of a bucket in the <emphasis>haman</emphasis>.
The stairs leading to the upper porch have fallen. Nothing here but
the smell of empty years. How many years? I can't be sure.</p>

<p>	I am carrying a
teakwood box with a leather handle. The box is locked. I have the key
but I will not open the box here. I take the path to Dink's house.
Sometimes paths last longer than roads.</p>

<p>	There it is on the
beach, just as I remember it. Sand has covered the steps and drifted
across the floor. Smell of nothing and nobody there. I sit down on
the sand-covered steps and look out to the harbor at the ship that
brought me here and that will take me away. I take out my key and
open the box and leaf through the yellow pages. The last entry is
from many years ago.</p>

<p>	We were in Panama
waiting for the Spanish. I am back in the fort watching the advancing
soldiers through a telescope, closer and closer to death.</p>

<p>	<emphasis>"Go
back!"</emphasis> I am screaming without a throat, with a tongue—<emphasis>"Get
in your galleons and go back to Spain!"</emphasis></p>

<p>	Hearing the final
sonorous knell of Spain as church bells silently implode into Sisters
of Mary, Communions, Confessions ...</p>

<p>
<emphasis>"Paco ... Joselito
... Enrique."</emphasis></p>

<p>Father
Kelley is giving them absolution. There is pain in his voice, It's
too easy. Then our shells and mortars rip through them like a great
iron fist. A few still take cover and return fire.</p>

<p>	Paco catches a bullet
in the chest. Sad shrinking face. He pulls my head down as the gray
lips whisper—"I want the priest."</p><empty-line /><p>I didn't want to write
about this or what followed. Guayaquil, Lima, Santiago and all the
others I didn't see. The easiest victories are the most costly in the
end.</p>

<p>	I have blown a hole in
time with firecracker. Let others step through. Into what bigger and
bigger firecrackers? Better weapons led to better and better weapons,
until the earth is a grenade with the fuse burning.</p>

<p>	I remember a dream of
my childhood. I am in a beautiful garden. As I reach out to touch the
flowers they wither under my hands. A nightmare feeling of foreboding
and desolation comes over me as a great mushroom-shaped cloud darkens
the earth. A few may get through the gate in time. Like Spain, I am
bound to the past.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>'Not only Burrough's
