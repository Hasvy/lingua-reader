<p>I</p>

<p>On an evening in the latter part of May a middle-aged man was walking</p>

<p>homeward from Shaston to the village of Marlott, in the adjoining</p>

<p>Vale of Blakemore, or Blackmoor.  The pair of legs that carried him</p>

<p>were rickety, and there was a bias in his gait which inclined him</p>

<p>somewhat to the left of a straight line.  He occasionally gave a</p>

<p>smart nod, as if in confirmation of some opinion, though he was not</p>

<p>thinking of anything in particular.  An empty egg-basket was slung</p>

<p>upon his arm, the nap of his hat was ruffled, a patch being quite</p>

<p>worn away at its brim where his thumb came in taking it off.</p>

<p>Presently he was met by an elderly parson astride on a gray mare,</p>

<p>who, as he rode, hummed a wandering tune.</p>

<p>"Good night t'ee," said the man with the basket.</p>

<p>"Good night, Sir John," said the parson.</p>

<p>The pedestrian, after another pace or two, halted, and turned round.</p>

<p>"Now, sir, begging your pardon; we met last market-day on this road</p>

<p>about this time, and I said 'Good night,' and you made reply '_Good</p>

<p>night, Sir John_,' as now."</p>

<p>"I did," said the parson.</p>

<p>"And once before that--near a month ago."</p>

<p>"I may have."</p>

<p>"Then what might your meaning be in calling me 'Sir John' these</p>

<p>different times, when I be plain Jack Durbeyfield, the haggler?"</p>

<p>The parson rode a step or two nearer.</p>

<p>"It was only my whim," he said; and, after a moment's hesitation: "It</p>

<p>was on account of a discovery I made some little time ago, whilst I</p>

<p>was hunting up pedigrees for the new county history.  I am Parson</p>

<p>Tringham, the antiquary, of Stagfoot Lane.  Don't you really know,</p>

<p>Durbeyfield, that you are the lineal representative of the ancient</p>

<p>and knightly family of the d'Urbervilles, who derive their descent</p>

<p>from Sir Pagan d'Urberville, that renowned knight who came from</p>

<p>Normandy with William the Conqueror, as appears by Battle Abbey</p>

<p>Roll?"</p>

<p>"Never heard it before, sir!"</p>

<p>"Well it's true.  Throw up your chin a moment, so that I may catch</p>

<p>the profile of your face better.  Yes, that's the d'Urberville nose</p>

<p>and chin--a little debased.  Your ancestor was one of the twelve</p>

<p>knights who assisted the Lord of Estremavilla in Normandy in his</p>

<p>conquest of Glamorganshire.  Branches of your family held manors over</p>

<p>all this part of England; their names appear in the Pipe Rolls in the</p>

<p>time of King Stephen.  In the reign of King John one of them was rich</p>

<p>enough to give a manor to the Knights Hospitallers; and in Edward the</p>

<p>Second's time your forefather Brian was summoned to Westminster to</p>

<p>attend the great Council there.  You declined a little in Oliver</p>

<p>Cromwell's time, but to no serious extent, and in Charles the</p>

<p>Second's reign you were made Knights of the Royal Oak for your</p>

<p>loyalty.  Aye, there have been generations of Sir Johns among</p>

<p>you, and if knighthood were hereditary, like a baronetcy, as it</p>

<p>practically was in old times, when men were knighted from father</p>

<p>to son, you would be Sir John now."</p>

<p>"Ye don't say so!"</p>

<p>"In short," concluded the parson, decisively smacking his leg with</p>

<p>his switch, "there's hardly such another family in England."</p>

<p>"Daze my eyes, and isn't there?" said Durbeyfield.  "And here have I</p>

<p>been knocking about, year after year, from pillar to post, as if I</p>

<p>was no more than the commonest feller in the parish...  And how long</p>

<p>hev this news about me been knowed, Pa'son Tringham?"</p>

<p>The clergyman explained that, as far as he was aware, it had quite</p>

<p>died out of knowledge, and could hardly be said to be known at all.</p>

<p>His own investigations had begun on a day in the preceding spring</p>

<p>when, having been engaged in tracing the vicissitudes of the</p>

<p>d'Urberville family, he had observed Durbeyfield's name on his</p>

<p>waggon, and had thereupon been led to make inquiries about his</p>

<p>father and grandfather till he had no doubt on the subject.</p>

<p>"At first I resolved not to disturb you with such a useless piece of</p>

<p>information," said he.  "However, our impulses are too strong for our</p>

<p>judgement sometimes.  I thought you might perhaps know something of</p>

<p>it all the while."</p>

<p>"Well, I have heard once or twice, 'tis true, that my family had seen</p>

<p>better days afore they came to Blackmoor.  But I took no notice o't,</p>

<p>thinking it to mean that we had once kept two horses where we now</p>

<p>keep only one.  I've got a wold silver spoon, and a wold graven seal</p>

<p>at home, too; but, Lord, what's a spoon and seal? ...  And to think</p>

<p>that I and these noble d'Urbervilles were one flesh all the time.</p>

<p>'Twas said that my gr't-granfer had secrets, and didn't care to talk</p>

<p>of where he came from...  And where do we raise our smoke, now,</p>

<p>parson, if I may make so bold; I mean, where do we d'Urbervilles</p>

<p>live?"</p>

<p>"You don't live anywhere. You are extinct--as a county family."</p>

<p>"That's bad."</p>

<p>"Yes--what the mendacious family chronicles call extinct in the male</p>

<p>line--that is, gone down--gone under."</p>

<p>"Then where do we lie?"</p>

<p>"At Kingsbere-sub-Greenhill: rows and rows of you in your vaults,</p>

<p>with your effigies under Purbeck-marble canopies."</p>

<p>"And where be our family mansions and estates?"</p>

<p>"You haven't any."</p>

<p>"Oh?  No lands neither?"</p>

<p>"None; though you once had 'em in abundance, as I said, for you</p>

<p>family consisted of numerous branches.  In this county there was a</p>

<p>seat of yours at Kingsbere, and another at Sherton, and another in</p>

<p>Millpond, and another at Lullstead, and another at Wellbridge."</p>

<p>"And shall we ever come into our own again?"</p>

<p>"Ah--that I can't tell!"</p>

<p>"And what had I better do about it, sir?" asked Durbeyfield, after a</p>

<p>pause.</p>

<p>"Oh--nothing, nothing; except chasten yourself with the thought of</p>

<p>'how are the mighty fallen.'  It is a fact of some interest to the</p>

<p>local historian and genealogist, nothing more.  There are several</p>

<p>families among the cottagers of this county of almost equal lustre.</p>

<p>Good night."</p>

<p>"But you'll turn back and have a quart of beer wi' me on the strength</p>

<p>o't, Pa'son Tringham?  There's a very pretty brew in tap at The Pure</p>

<p>Drop--though, to be sure, not so good as at Rolliver's."</p>

<p>"No, thank you--not this evening, Durbeyfield.  You've had enough</p>

<p>already."  Concluding thus, the parson rode on his way, with doubts</p>

<p>as to his discretion in retailing this curious bit of lore.</p>

<p>When he was gone, Durbeyfield walked a few steps in a profound</p>

<p>reverie, and then sat down upon the grassy bank by the roadside,</p>

<p>depositing his basket before him.  In a few minutes a youth appeared</p>

<p>in the distance, walking in the same direction as that which had been</p>

<p>pursued by Durbeyfield.  The latter, on seeing him, held up his hand,</p>

<p>and the lad quickened his pace and came near.</p>

<p>"Boy, take up that basket!  I want 'ee to go on an errand for me."</p>

<p>The lath-like stripling frowned.  "Who be you, then, John</p>

<p>Durbeyfield, to order me about and call me 'boy'?  You know my</p>

<p>name as well as I know yours!"</p>

<p>"Do you, do you?  That's the secret--that's the secret! Now obey my</p>

<p>orders, and take the message I'm going to charge 'ee wi'...  Well,</p>

<p>Fred, I don't mind telling you that the secret is that I'm one of a</p>

<p>noble race--it has been just found out by me this present afternoon,</p>

<p>P.M."  And as he made the announcement, Durbeyfield, declining from</p>

<p>his sitting position, luxuriously stretched himself out upon the bank</p>

<p>among the daisies.</p>

<p>The lad stood before Durbeyfield, and contemplated his length from</p>

<p>crown to toe.</p>

<p>"Sir John d'Urberville--that's who I am," continued the prostrate</p>

<p>man.  "That is if knights were baronets--which they be.  'Tis</p>

<p>recorded in history all about me.  Dost know of such a place, lad,</p>

<p>as Kingsbere-sub-Greenhill?"</p>

<p>"Ees.  I've been there to Greenhill Fair."</p>

<p>"Well, under the church of that city there lie--"</p>

<p>"'Tisn't a city, the place I mean; leastwise 'twaddn' when I was</p>

<p>there--'twas a little one-eyed, blinking sort o' place."</p>

<p>"Never you mind the place, boy, that's not the question before us.</p>

<p>Under the church of that there parish lie my ancestors--hundreds of</p>

<p>'em--in coats of mail and jewels, in gr't lead coffins weighing tons</p>

<p>and tons.  There's not a man in the county o' South-Wessex that's</p>

<p>got grander and nobler skillentons in his family than I."</p>

<p>"Oh?"</p>

<p>"Now take up that basket, and goo on to Marlott, and when you've come</p>

<p>to The Pure Drop Inn, tell 'em to send a horse and carriage to me</p>

<p>immed'ately, to carry me hwome.  And in the bottom o' the carriage</p>

<p>they be to put a noggin o' rum in a small bottle, and chalk it up</p>

<p>to my account.  And when you've done that goo on to my house with</p>

<p>the basket, and tell my wife to put away that washing, because she</p>

<p>needn't finish it, and wait till I come hwome, as I've news to tell</p>

<p>her."</p>

<p>As the lad stood in a dubious attitude, Durbeyfield put his hand in</p>

<p>his pocket, and produced a shilling, one of the chronically few that</p>

<p>he possessed.</p>

<p>"Here's for your labour, lad."</p>

<p>This made a difference in the young man's estimate of the position.</p>

<p>"Yes, Sir John.  Thank 'ee.  Anything else I can do for 'ee, Sir</p>

<p>John?"</p>

<p>"Tell 'em at hwome that I should like for supper,--well, lamb's fry</p>

<p>if they can get it; and if they can't, black-pot; and if they can't</p>

<p>get that, well chitterlings will do."</p>

<p>"Yes, Sir John."</p>

<p>The boy took up the basket, and as he set out the notes of a brass</p>

<p>band were heard from the direction of the village.</p>

<p>"What's that?" said Durbeyfield.  "Not on account o' I?"</p>

<p>"'Tis the women's club-walking, Sir John.  Why, your da'ter is one o'</p>

<p>the members."</p>

<p>"To be sure--I'd quite forgot it in my thoughts of greater things!</p>

<p>Well, vamp on to Marlott, will ye, and order that carriage, and</p>

<p>maybe I'll drive round and inspect the club."</p>

<p>The lad departed, and Durbeyfield lay waiting on the grass and</p>

<p>daisies in the evening sun.  Not a soul passed that way for a long</p>

<p>while, and the faint notes of the band were the only human sounds</p>

<p>audible within the rim of blue hills.</p>

<p>II</p>

<p>The village of Marlott lay amid the north-eastern undulations of the</p>

<p>beautiful Vale of Blakemore, or Blackmoor, aforesaid, an engirdled</p>

<p>and secluded region, for the most part untrodden as yet by tourist or</p>

<p>landscape-painter, though within a four hours' journey from London.</p>

<p>It is a vale whose acquaintance is best made by viewing it from the</p>

<p>summits of the hills that surround it--except perhaps during the</p>

<p>droughts of summer.  An unguided ramble into its recesses in bad</p>

<p>weather is apt to engender dissatisfaction with its narrow, tortuous,</p>

<p>and miry ways.</p>

<p>This fertile and sheltered tract of country, in which the fields are</p>

<p>never brown and the springs never dry, is bounded on the south by the</p>

<p>bold chalk ridge that embraces the prominences of Hambledon Hill,</p>

<p>Bulbarrow, Nettlecombe-Tout, Dogbury, High Stoy, and Bubb Down.  The</p>

<p>traveller from the coast, who, after plodding northward for a score</p>

<p>of miles over calcareous downs and corn-lands, suddenly reaches</p>

<p>the verge of one of these escarpments, is surprised and delighted</p>

<p>to behold, extended like a map beneath him, a country differing</p>

<p>absolutely from that which he has passed through.  Behind him the</p>

<p>hills are open, the sun blazes down upon fields so large as to give</p>

<p>an unenclosed character to the landscape, the lanes are white, the</p>

<p>hedges low and plashed, the atmosphere colourless.  Here, in the</p>

<p>valley, the world seems to be constructed upon a smaller and more</p>

<p>delicate scale; the fields are mere paddocks, so reduced that from</p>

<p>this height their hedgerows appear a network of dark green threads</p>

<p>overspreading the paler green of the grass.  The atmosphere beneath</p>

<p>is languorous, and is so tinged with azure that what artists call the</p>

<p>middle distance partakes also of that hue, while the horizon beyond</p>

<p>is of the deepest ultramarine.  Arable lands are few and limited;</p>

<p>with but slight exceptions the prospect is a broad rich mass of grass</p>

<p>and trees, mantling minor hills and dales within the major.  Such is</p>

<p>the Vale of Blackmoor.</p>

<p>The district is of historic, no less than of topographical interest.</p>

<p>The Vale was known in former times as the Forest of White Hart, from</p>

<p>a curious legend of King Henry III's reign, in which the killing by</p>

<p>a certain Thomas de la Lynd of a beautiful white hart which the king</p>

<p>had run down and spared, was made the occasion of a heavy fine.</p>

<p>In those days, and till comparatively recent times, the country was</p>

<p>densely wooded.  Even now, traces of its earlier condition are to be</p>

<p>found in the old oak copses and irregular belts of timber that yet</p>

<p>survive upon its slopes, and the hollow-trunked trees that shade so</p>

<p>many of its pastures.</p>

<p>The forests have departed, but some old customs of their shades</p>

<p>remain.  Many, however, linger only in a metamorphosed or disguised</p>

<p>form.  The May-Day dance, for instance, was to be discerned on</p>

<p>the afternoon under notice, in the guise of the club revel, or</p>

<p>"club-walking," as it was there called.</p>

<p>It was an interesting event to the younger inhabitants of Marlott,</p>

<p>though its real interest was not observed by the participators in the</p>

<p>ceremony.  Its singularity lay less in the retention of a custom of</p>

<p>walking in procession and dancing on each anniversary than in the</p>

<p>members being solely women.  In men's clubs such celebrations were,</p>

<p>though expiring, less uncommon; but either the natural shyness of the</p>

<p>softer sex, or a sarcastic attitude on the part of male relatives,</p>

<p>had denuded such women's clubs as remained (if any other did) or this</p>

<p>their glory and consummation.  The club of Marlott alone lived to</p>

<p>uphold the local Cerealia.  It had walked for hundreds of years, if</p>

<p>not as benefit-club, as votive sisterhood of some sort; and it walked</p>

<p>still.</p>

<p>The banded ones were all dressed in white gowns--a gay survival from</p>

<p>Old Style days, when cheerfulness and May-time were synonyms--days</p>

<p>before the habit of taking long views had reduced emotions to a</p>

<p>monotonous average.  Their first exhibition of themselves was in a</p>

<p>processional march of two and two round the parish.  Ideal and real</p>

<p>clashed slightly as the sun lit up their figures against the green</p>

<p>hedges and creeper-laced house-fronts; for, though the whole troop</p>

<p>wore white garments, no two whites were alike among them.  Some</p>

<p>approached pure blanching; some had a bluish pallor; some worn by the</p>

<p>older characters (which had possibly lain by folded for many a year)</p>

<p>inclined to a cadaverous tint, and to a Georgian style.</p>

<p>In addition to the distinction of a white frock, every woman and girl</p>

<p>carried in her right hand a peeled willow wand, and in her left a</p>

<p>bunch of white flowers.  The peeling of the former, and the selection</p>

<p>of the latter, had been an operation of personal care.</p>

<p>There were a few middle-aged and even elderly women in the train,</p>

<p>their silver-wiry hair and wrinkled faces, scourged by time and</p>

<p>trouble, having almost a grotesque, certainly a pathetic, appearance</p>

<p>in such a jaunty situation.  In a true view, perhaps, there was more</p>

<p>to be gathered and told of each anxious and experienced one, to whom</p>

<p>the years were drawing nigh when she should say, "I have no pleasure</p>

<p>in them," than of her juvenile comrades.  But let the elder be passed</p>

<p>over here for those under whose bodices the life throbbed quick and</p>

<p>warm.</p>

<p>The young girls formed, indeed, the majority of the band, and their</p>

<p>heads of luxuriant hair reflected in the sunshine every tone of gold,</p>

<p>and black, and brown.  Some had beautiful eyes, others a beautiful</p>

<p>nose, others a beautiful mouth and figure: few, if any, had all.  A</p>

<p>difficulty of arranging their lips in this crude exposure to public</p>

<p>scrutiny, an inability to balance their heads, and to dissociate</p>

<p>self-consciousness from their features, was apparent in them, and</p>

<p>showed that they were genuine country girls, unaccustomed to many</p>

<p>eyes.</p>

<p>And as each and all of them were warmed without by the sun, so each</p>

<p>had a private little sun for her soul to bask in; some dream, some</p>

<p>affection, some hobby, at least some remote and distant hope which,</p>

<p>though perhaps starving to nothing, still lived on, as hopes will.</p>

<p>They were all cheerful, and many of them merry.</p>

<p>They came round by The Pure Drop Inn, and were turning out of the</p>

<p>high road to pass through a wicket-gate into the meadows, when one of</p>

<p>the women said--</p>

<p>"The Load-a-Lord!  Why, Tess Durbeyfield, if there isn't thy father</p>

<p>riding hwome in a carriage!"</p>

<p>A young member of the band turned her head at the exclamation.</p>

<p>She was a fine and handsome girl--not handsomer than some others,</p>

<p>possibly--but her mobile peony mouth and large innocent eyes added</p>

<p>eloquence to colour and shape.  She wore a red ribbon in her hair,</p>

<p>and was the only one of the white company who could boast of such</p>

<p>a pronounced adornment.  As she looked round Durbeyfield was seen</p>

<p>moving along the road in a chaise belonging to The Pure Drop, driven</p>

<p>by a frizzle-headed brawny damsel with her gown-sleeves rolled above</p>

<p>her elbows.  This was the cheerful servant of that establishment,</p>

<p>who, in her part of factotum, turned groom and ostler at times.</p>

<p>Durbeyfield, leaning back, and with his eyes closed luxuriously, was</p>

<p>waving his hand above his head, and singing in a slow recitative--</p>

<p>"I've-got-a-gr't-family-vault-at-Kingsbere--and</p>

<p>knighted-forefathers-in-lead-coffins-there!"</p>

<p>The clubbists tittered, except the girl called Tess--in whom a slow</p>

<p>heat seemed to rise at the sense that her father was making himself</p>

<p>foolish in their eyes.</p>

<p>"He's tired, that's all," she said hastily, "and he has got a lift</p>

<p>home, because our own horse has to rest to-day."</p>

<p>"Bless thy simplicity, Tess," said her companions.  "He's got his</p>

<p>market-nitch.  Haw-haw!"</p>

<p>"Look here; I won't walk another inch with you, if you say any jokes</p>

<p>about him!" Tess cried, and the colour upon her cheeks spread over</p>

<p>her face and neck.  In a moment her eyes grew moist, and her glance</p>

<p>drooped to the ground.  Perceiving that they had really pained her</p>

<p>they said no more, and order again prevailed.  Tess's pride would not</p>

<p>allow her to turn her head again, to learn what her father's meaning</p>

<p>was, if he had any; and thus she moved on with the whole body to the</p>

<p>enclosure where there was to be dancing on the green.  By the time</p>

<p>the spot was reached she has recovered her equanimity, and tapped her</p>

<p>neighbour with her wand and talked as usual.</p>

<p>Tess Durbeyfield at this time of her life was a mere vessel of</p>

<p>emotion untinctured by experience.  The dialect was on her tongue</p>

<p>to some extent, despite the village school: the characteristic</p>

<p>intonation of that dialect for this district being the voicing</p>

<p>approximately rendered by the syllable UR, probably as rich an</p>

<p>utterance as any to be found in human speech.  The pouted-up deep red</p>

<p>mouth to which this syllable was native had hardly as yet settled</p>

<p>into its definite shape, and her lower lip had a way of thrusting the</p>

<p>middle of her top one upward, when they closed together after a word.</p>

<p>Phases of her childhood lurked in her aspect still.  As she walked</p>

<p>along to-day, for all her bouncing handsome womanliness, you could</p>

<p>sometimes see her twelfth year in her cheeks, or her ninth sparkling</p>

<p>from her eyes; and even her fifth would flit over the curves of her</p>

<p>mouth now and then.</p>

<p>Yet few knew, and still fewer considered this.  A small minority,</p>

<p>mainly strangers, would look long at her in casually passing by, and</p>

<p>grow momentarily fascinated by her freshness, and wonder if they</p>

<p>would ever see her again: but to almost everybody she was a fine and</p>

<p>picturesque country girl, and no more.</p>

<p>Nothing was seen or heard further of Durbeyfield in his triumphal</p>

<p>chariot under the conduct of the ostleress, and the club having</p>

<p>entered the allotted space, dancing began.  As there were no men in</p>

<p>the company, the girls danced at first with each other, but when the</p>

<p>hour for the close of labour drew on, the masculine inhabitants of</p>

<p>the village, together with other idlers and pedestrians, gathered</p>

<p>round the spot, and appeared inclined to negotiate for a partner.</p>

<p>Among these on-lookers were three young men of a superior class,</p>

<p>carrying small knapsacks strapped to their shoulders, and stout</p>

<p>sticks in their hands.  Their general likeness to each other, and</p>

<p>their consecutive ages, would almost have suggested that they might</p>

<p>be, what in fact they were, brothers.  The eldest wore the white tie,</p>

<p>high waistcoat, and thin-brimmed hat of the regulation curate; the</p>

<p>second was the normal undergraduate; the appearance of the third and</p>

<p>youngest would hardly have been sufficient to characterize him; there</p>

<p>was an uncribbed, uncabined aspect in his eyes and attire, implying</p>

<p>that he had hardly as yet found the entrance to his professional</p>

<p>groove.  That he was a desultory tentative student of something and</p>

<p>everything might only have been predicted of him.</p>

<p>These three brethren told casual acquaintance that they were spending</p>

<p>their Whitsun holidays in a walking tour through the Vale of</p>

<p>Blackmoor, their course being south-westerly from the town of Shaston</p>

<p>on the north-east.</p>

<p>They leant over the gate by the highway, and inquired as to the</p>

<p>meaning of the dance and the white-frocked maids.  The two elder of</p>

<p>the brothers were plainly not intending to linger more than a moment,</p>

<p>but the spectacle of a bevy of girls dancing without male partners</p>

<p>seemed to amuse the third, and make him in no hurry to move on.  He</p>

<p>unstrapped his knapsack, put it, with his stick, on the hedge-bank,</p>

<p>and opened the gate.</p>

<p>"What are you going to do, Angel?" asked the eldest.</p>

<p>"I am inclined to go and have a fling with them.  Why not all of</p>

<p>us--just for a minute or two--it will not detain us long?"</p>

<p>"No--no; nonsense!" said the first.  "Dancing in public with a troop</p>

<p>of country hoydens--suppose we should be seen!  Come along, or it</p>

<p>will be dark before we get to Stourcastle, and there's no place we</p>

<p>can sleep at nearer than that; besides, we must get through another</p>

<p>chapter of _A Counterblast to Agnosticism_ before we turn in, now I</p>

<p>have taken the trouble to bring the book."</p>

<p>"All right--I'll overtake you and Cuthbert in five minutes; don't</p>

<p>stop; I give my word that I will, Felix."</p>

<p>The two elder reluctantly left him and walked on, taking their</p>

<p>brother's knapsack to relieve him in following, and the youngest</p>

<p>entered the field.</p>

<p>"This is a thousand pities," he said gallantly, to two or three of</p>

<p>the girls nearest him, as soon as there was a pause in the dance.</p>

<p>"Where are your partners, my dears?"</p>

<p>"They've not left off work yet," answered one of the boldest.</p>

<p>"They'll be here by and by.  Till then, will you be one, sir?"</p>

<p>"Certainly.  But what's one among so many!"</p>

<p>"Better than none.  'Tis melancholy work facing and footing it to one</p>

<p>of your own sort, and no clipsing and colling at all.  Now, pick and</p>

<p>choose."</p>

<p>"'Ssh--don't be so for'ard!" said a shyer girl.</p>

<p>The young man, thus invited, glanced them over, and attempted some</p>

<p>discrimination; but, as the group were all so new to him, he could</p>

<p>not very well exercise it.  He took almost the first that came to</p>

<p>hand, which was not the speaker, as she had expected; nor did it</p>

<p>happen to be Tess Durbeyfield.  Pedigree, ancestral skeletons,</p>

<p>monumental record, the d'Urberville lineaments, did not help Tess in</p>

<p>her life's battle as yet, even to the extent of attracting to her a</p>

<p>dancing-partner over the heads of the commonest peasantry.  So much</p>

<p>for Norman blood unaided by Victorian lucre.</p>

<p>The name of the eclipsing girl, whatever it was, has not been handed</p>

<p>down; but she was envied by all as the first who enjoyed the luxury</p>

<p>of a masculine partner that evening.  Yet such was the force of</p>

<p>example that the village young men, who had not hastened to enter</p>

<p>the gate while no intruder was in the way, now dropped in quickly,</p>

<p>and soon the couples became leavened with rustic youth to a marked</p>

<p>extent, till at length the plainest woman in the club was no longer</p>

<p>compelled to foot it on the masculine side of the figure.</p>

<p>The church clock struck, when suddenly the student said that he must</p>

<p>leave--he had been forgetting himself--he had to join his companions.</p>

<p>As he fell out of the dance his eyes lighted on Tess Durbeyfield,</p>

<p>whose own large orbs wore, to tell the truth, the faintest aspect of</p>

<p>reproach that he had not chosen her.  He, too, was sorry then that,</p>

<p>owing to her backwardness, he had not observed her; and with that in</p>

<p>his mind he left the pasture.</p>

<p>On account of his long delay he started in a flying-run down the lane</p>

<p>westward, and had soon passed the hollow and mounted the next rise.</p>

<p>He had not yet overtaken his brothers, but he paused to get breath,</p>

<p>and looked back.  He could see the white figures of the girls in the</p>

<p>green enclosure whirling about as they had whirled when he was among</p>

<p>them.  They seemed to have quite forgotten him already.</p>

<p>All of them, except, perhaps, one.  This white shape stood apart</p>

<p>by the hedge alone.  From her position he knew it to be the pretty</p>

<p>maiden with whom he had not danced.  Trifling as the matter was, he</p>

<p>yet instinctively felt that she was hurt by his oversight.  He wished</p>

<p>that he had asked her; he wished that he had inquired her name.  She</p>

<p>was so modest, so expressive, she had looked so soft in her thin</p>

<p>white gown that he felt he had acted stupidly.</p>

<p>However, it could not be helped, and turning, and bending himself to</p>

<p>a rapid walk, he dismissed the subject from his mind.</p>

<p>III</p>

<p>As for Tess Durbeyfield, she did not so easily dislodge the incident</p>

<p>from her consideration.  She had no spirit to dance again for a long</p>

<p>time, though she might have had plenty of partners; but ah! they did</p>

<p>not speak so nicely as the strange young man had done.  It was not</p>

<p>till the rays of the sun had absorbed the young stranger's retreating</p>

<p>figure on the hill that she shook off her temporary sadness and</p>

<p>answered her would-be partner in the affirmative.</p>

<p>She remained with her comrades till dusk, and participated with a</p>

<p>certain zest in the dancing; though, being heart-whole as yet, she</p>

<p>enjoyed treading a measure purely for its own sake; little divining</p>

<p>when she saw "the soft torments, the bitter sweets, the pleasing</p>

<p>pains, and the agreeable distresses" of those girls who had been</p>

<p>wooed and won, what she herself was capable of in that kind.  The</p>

<p>struggles and wrangles of the lads for her hand in a jig were an</p>

<p>amusement to her--no more; and when they became fierce she rebuked</p>

<p>them.</p>

<p>She might have stayed even later, but the incident of her father's</p>

<p>odd appearance and manner returned upon the girl's mind to make her</p>

<p>anxious, and wondering what had become of him she dropped away from</p>

<p>the dancers and bent her steps towards the end of the village at</p>

<p>which the parental cottage lay.</p>

<p>While yet many score yards off, other rhythmic sounds than those she</p>

<p>had quitted became audible to her; sounds that she knew well--so</p>

<p>well.  They were a regular series of thumpings from the interior of</p>

<p>the house, occasioned by the violent rocking of a cradle upon a stone</p>

<p>floor, to which movement a feminine voice kept time by singing, in a</p>

<p>vigorous gallopade, the favourite ditty of "The Spotted Cow"--</p>

<p>   I saw her lie do'-own in yon'-der green gro'-ove;</p>

<p>        Come, love!' and I'll tell' you where!'</p>

<p>The cradle-rocking and the song would cease simultaneously for a</p>

<p>moment, and an exclamation at highest vocal pitch would take the</p>

<p>place of the melody.</p>

<p>"God bless thy diment eyes!  And thy waxen cheeks!  And thy cherry</p>

<p>mouth!  And thy Cubit's thighs!  And every bit o' thy blessed body!"</p>

<p>After this invocation the rocking and the singing would recommence,</p>

<p>and the "Spotted Cow" proceed as before.  So matters stood when Tess</p>

<p>opened the door and paused upon the mat within it, surveying the</p>

<p>scene.</p>

<p>The interior, in spite of the melody, struck upon the girl's senses</p>

<p>with an unspeakable dreariness.  From the holiday gaieties of the</p>

<p>field--the white gowns, the nosegays, the willow-wands, the whirling</p>

<p>movements on the green, the flash of gentle sentiment towards the</p>

<p>stranger--to the yellow melancholy of this one-candled spectacle,</p>

<p>what a step!  Besides the jar of contrast there came to her a chill</p>

<p>self-reproach that she had not returned sooner, to help her mother</p>

<p>in these domesticities, instead of indulging herself out-of-doors.</p>

<p>There stood her mother amid the group of children, as Tess had left</p>

<p>her, hanging over the Monday washing-tub, which had now, as always,</p>

<p>lingered on to the end of the week.  Out of that tub had come the day</p>

<p>before--Tess felt it with a dreadful sting of remorse--the very white</p>

<p>frock upon her back which she had so carelessly greened about the</p>

<p>skirt on the damping grass--which had been wrung up and ironed by her</p>

<p>mother's own hands.</p>

<p>As usual, Mrs Durbeyfield was balanced on one foot beside the tub,</p>

<p>the other being engaged in the aforesaid business of rocking her</p>

<p>youngest child.  The cradle-rockers had done hard duty for so many</p>

<p>years, under the weight of so many children, on that flagstone floor,</p>

<p>that they were worn nearly flat, in consequence of which a huge jerk</p>

<p>accompanied each swing of the cot, flinging the baby from side to</p>

<p>side like a weaver's shuttle, as Mrs Durbeyfield, excited by her</p>

<p>song, trod the rocker with all the spring that was left in her after</p>

<p>a long day's seething in the suds.</p>

<p>Nick-knock, nick-knock, went the cradle; the candle-flame stretched</p>

<p>itself tall, and began jigging up and down; the water dribbled from</p>

<p>the matron's elbows, and the song galloped on to the end of the</p>

<p>verse, Mrs Durbeyfield regarding her daughter the while.  Even now,</p>

<p>when burdened with a young family, Joan Durbeyfield was a passionate</p>

<p>lover of tune.  No ditty floated into Blackmoor Vale from the outer</p>

<p>world but Tess's mother caught up its notation in a week.</p>

<p>There still faintly beamed from the woman's features something of</p>

<p>the freshness, and even the prettiness, of her youth; rendering it</p>

<p>probable that the personal charms which Tess could boast of were in</p>

<p>main part her mother's gift, and therefore unknightly, unhistorical.</p>

<p>"I'll rock the cradle for 'ee, mother," said the daughter gently.</p>

<p>"Or I'll take off my best frock and help you wring up?  I thought you</p>

<p>had finished long ago."</p>

<p>Her mother bore Tess no ill-will for leaving the housework to her</p>

<p>single-handed efforts for so long; indeed, Joan seldom upbraided</p>

<p>her thereon at any time, feeling but slightly the lack of Tess's</p>

<p>assistance whilst her instinctive plan for relieving herself of her</p>

<p>labours lay in postponing them.  To-night, however, she was even in a</p>

<p>blither mood than usual.  There was a dreaminess, a pre-occupation,</p>

<p>an exaltation, in the maternal look which the girl could not</p>

<p>understand.</p>

<p>"Well, I'm glad you've come," her mother said, as soon as the last</p>

<p>note had passed out of her.  "I want to go and fetch your father;</p>

<p>but what's more'n that, I want to tell 'ee what have happened.  Y'll</p>

<p>be fess enough, my poppet, when th'st know!"  (Mrs Durbeyfield</p>

<p>habitually spoke the dialect; her daughter, who had passed the Sixth</p>

<p>Standard in the National School under a London-trained mistress,</p>

<p>spoke two languages: the dialect at home, more or less; ordinary</p>

<p>English abroad and to persons of quality.)</p>

<p>"Since I've been away?" Tess asked.</p>

<p>"Ay!"</p>

<p>"Had it anything to do with father's making such a mommet of himself</p>

<p>in thik carriage this afternoon?  Why did 'er?  I felt inclined to</p>

<p>sink into the ground with shame!"</p>

<p>"That wer all a part of the larry!  We've been found to be the</p>

<p>greatest gentlefolk in the whole county--reaching all back long</p>

<p>before Oliver Grumble's time--to the days of the Pagan Turks--with</p>

<p>monuments, and vaults, and crests, and 'scutcheons, and the Lord</p>

<p>knows what all.  In Saint Charles's days we was made Knights o' the</p>

<p>Royal Oak, our real name being d'Urberville! ...  Don't that make</p>

<p>your bosom plim?  'Twas on this account that your father rode home</p>

<p>in the vlee; not because he'd been drinking, as people supposed."</p>

<p>"I'm glad of that.  Will it do us any good, mother?"</p>

<p>"O yes!  'Tis thoughted that great things may come o't.  No doubt a</p>

<p>mampus of volk of our own rank will be down here in their carriages</p>

<p>as soon as 'tis known.  Your father learnt it on his way hwome</p>

<p>from Shaston, and he has been telling me the whole pedigree of the</p>

<p>matter."</p>

<p>"Where is father now?" asked Tess suddenly.</p>

<p>Her mother gave irrelevant information by way of answer: "He called</p>

<p>to see the doctor to-day in Shaston.  It is not consumption at all,</p>

<p>it seems.  It is fat round his heart, 'a says.  There, it is like</p>

<p>this."  Joan Durbeyfield, as she spoke, curved a sodden thumb</p>

<p>and forefinger to the shape of the letter C, and used the other</p>

<p>forefinger as a pointer.  "'At the present moment,' he says to your</p>

<p>father, 'your heart is enclosed all round there, and all round</p>

<p>there; this space is still open,' 'a says.  'As soon as it do</p>

<p>meet, so,'"--Mrs Durbeyfield closed her fingers into a circle</p>

<p>complete--"'off you will go like a shadder, Mr Durbeyfield,' 'a says.</p>

<p>'You mid last ten years; you mid go off in ten months, or ten days.'"</p>

<p>Tess looked alarmed.  Her father possibly to go behind the eternal</p>

<p>cloud so soon, notwithstanding this sudden greatness!</p>

<p>"But where IS father?" she asked again.</p>

<p>Her mother put on a deprecating look.  "Now don't you be bursting out</p>

<p>angry!  The poor man--he felt so rafted after his uplifting by the</p>

<p>pa'son's news--that he went up to Rolliver's half an hour ago.  He do</p>

<p>want to get up his strength for his journey to-morrow with that load</p>

<p>of beehives, which must be delivered, family or no.  He'll have to</p>

<p>start shortly after twelve to-night, as the distance is so long."</p>

<p>"Get up his strength!" said Tess impetuously, the tears welling to</p>

<p>her eyes.  "O my God!  Go to a public-house to get up his strength!</p>

<p>And you as well agreed as he, mother!"</p>

<p>Her rebuke and her mood seemed to fill the whole room, and to impart</p>

<p>a cowed look to the furniture, and candle, and children playing</p>

<p>about, and to her mother's face.</p>

<p>"No," said the latter touchily, "I be not agreed.  I have been</p>

<p>waiting for 'ee to bide and keep house while I go fetch him."</p>

<p>"I'll go."</p>

<p>"O no, Tess.  You see, it would be no use."</p>

<p>Tess did not expostulate.  She knew what her mother's objection</p>

<p>meant.  Mrs Durbeyfield's jacket and bonnet were already hanging</p>

<p>slily upon a chair by her side, in readiness for this contemplated</p>

<p>jaunt, the reason for which the matron deplored more than its</p>

<p>necessity.</p>

<p>"And take the _Compleat Fortune-Teller_ to the outhouse," Joan</p>

<p>continued, rapidly wiping her hands, and donning the garments.</p>

<p>The _Compleat Fortune-Teller_ was an old thick volume, which lay on a</p>

<p>table at her elbow, so worn by pocketing that the margins had reached</p>

<p>the edge of the type.  Tess took it up, and her mother started.</p>

<p>This going to hunt up her shiftless husband at the inn was one of</p>

<p>Mrs Durbeyfield's still extant enjoyments in the muck and muddle of</p>

<p>rearing children.  To discover him at Rolliver's, to sit there for</p>

<p>an hour or two by his side and dismiss all thought and care of the</p>

<p>children during the interval, made her happy.  A sort of halo, an</p>

<p>occidental glow, came over life then.  Troubles and other realities</p>

<p>took on themselves a metaphysical impalpability, sinking to mere</p>

<p>mental phenomena for serene contemplation, and no longer stood as</p>

<p>pressing concretions which chafed body and soul.  The youngsters,</p>

<p>not immediately within sight, seemed rather bright and desirable</p>

<p>appurtenances than otherwise; the incidents of daily life were not</p>

<p>without humorousness and jollity in their aspect there.  She felt a</p>

<p>little as she had used to feel when she sat by her now wedded husband</p>

<p>in the same spot during his wooing, shutting her eyes to his defects</p>

<p>of character, and regarding him only in his ideal presentation as</p>

<p>lover.</p>

<p>Tess, being left alone with the younger children, went first to the</p>

<p>outhouse with the fortune-telling book, and stuffed it into the</p>

<p>thatch.  A curious fetishistic fear of this grimy volume on the part</p>

<p>of her mother prevented her ever allowing it to stay in the house all</p>

<p>night, and hither it was brought back whenever it had been consulted.</p>

<p>Between the mother, with her fast-perishing lumber of superstitions,</p>

<p>folk-lore, dialect, and orally transmitted ballads, and the daughter,</p>

<p>with her trained National teachings and Standard knowledge under an</p>

<p>infinitely Revised Code, there was a gap of two hundred years as</p>

<p>ordinarily understood.  When they were together the Jacobean and the</p>

<p>Victorian ages were juxtaposed.</p>

<p>Returning along the garden path Tess mused on what the mother could</p>

<p>have wished to ascertain from the book on this particular day.  She</p>

<p>guessed the recent ancestral discovery to bear upon it, but did not</p>

<p>divine that it solely concerned herself.  Dismissing this, however,</p>

<p>she busied herself with sprinkling the linen dried during the</p>

<p>day-time, in company with her nine-year-old brother Abraham, and her</p>

<p>sister Eliza-Louisa of twelve and a half, called "'Liza-Lu," the</p>

<p>youngest ones being put to bed.  There was an interval of four years</p>

<p>and more between Tess and the next of the family, the two who had</p>

<p>filled the gap having died in their infancy, and this lent her a</p>

<p>deputy-maternal attitude when she was alone with her juniors.  Next</p>

<p>in juvenility to Abraham came two more girls, Hope and Modesty; then</p>

<p>a boy of three, and then the baby, who had just completed his first</p>

<p>year.</p>

<p>All these young souls were passengers in the Durbeyfield</p>

<p>ship--entirely dependent on the judgement of the two Durbeyfield</p>

<p>adults for their pleasures, their necessities, their health, even</p>

<p>their existence.  If the heads of the Durbeyfield household chose</p>

<p>to sail into difficulty, disaster, starvation, disease, degradation,</p>

<p>death, thither were these half-dozen little captives under hatches</p>

<p>compelled to sail with them--six helpless creatures, who had never</p>

<p>been asked if they wished for life on any terms, much less if they</p>

<p>wished for it on such hard conditions as were involved in being of</p>

<p>the shiftless house of Durbeyfield.  Some people would like to know</p>

<p>whence the poet whose philosophy is in these days deemed as profound</p>

<p>and trustworthy as his song is breezy and pure, gets his authority</p>

<p>for speaking of "Nature's holy plan."</p>

<p>It grew later, and neither father nor mother reappeared.  Tess looked</p>

<p>out of the door, and took a mental journey through Marlott.  The</p>

<p>village was shutting its eyes.  Candles and lamps were being put</p>

<p>out everywhere: she could inwardly behold the extinguisher and the</p>

<p>extended hand.</p>

<p>Her mother's fetching simply meant one more to fetch.  Tess began to</p>

<p>perceive that a man in indifferent health, who proposed to start on a</p>

<p>journey before one in the morning, ought not to be at an inn at this</p>

<p>late hour celebrating his ancient blood.</p>

<p>"Abraham," she said to her little brother, "do you put on your</p>

<p>hat--you bain't afraid?--and go up to Rolliver's, and see what has</p>

<p>gone wi' father and mother."</p>

<p>The boy jumped promptly from his seat, and opened the door, and the</p>

<p>night swallowed him up.  Half an hour passed yet again; neither man,</p>

<p>woman, nor child returned.  Abraham, like his parents, seemed to have</p>

<p>been limed and caught by the ensnaring inn.</p>

<p>"I must go myself," she said.</p>

<p>'Liza-Lu then went to bed, and Tess, locking them all in, started on</p>

<p>her way up the dark and crooked lane or street not made for hasty</p>

<p>progress; a street laid out before inches of land had value, and when</p>

<p>one-handed clocks sufficiently subdivided the day.</p>

<p>IV</p>

<p>Rolliver's inn, the single alehouse at this end of the long and</p>

<p>broken village, could only boast of an off-licence; hence, as</p>

<p>nobody could legally drink on the premises, the amount of overt</p>

<p>accommodation for consumers was strictly limited to a little board</p>

<p>about six inches wide and two yards long, fixed to the garden palings</p>

<p>by pieces of wire, so as to form a ledge.  On this board thirsty</p>

<p>strangers deposited their cups as they stood in the road and drank,</p>

<p>and threw the dregs on the dusty ground to the pattern of Polynesia,</p>

<p>and wished they could have a restful seat inside.</p>

<p>Thus the strangers.  But there were also local customers who felt the</p>

<p>same wish; and where there's a will there's a way.</p>

<p>In a large bedroom upstairs, the window of which was thickly</p>

<p>curtained with a great woollen shawl lately discarded by the</p>

<p>landlady, Mrs Rolliver, were gathered on this evening nearly a dozen</p>

<p>persons, all seeking beatitude; all old inhabitants of the nearer</p>

<p>end of Marlott, and frequenters of this retreat. Not only did the</p>

<p>distance to the The Pure Drop, the fully-licensed tavern at the</p>

<p>further part of the dispersed village, render its accommodation</p>

<p>practically unavailable for dwellers at this end; but the far more</p>

<p>serious question, the quality of the liquor, confirmed the prevalent</p>

<p>opinion that it was better to drink with Rolliver in a corner of the</p>

<p>housetop than with the other landlord in a wide house.</p>

<p>A gaunt four-post bedstead which stood in the room afforded</p>

<p>sitting-space for several persons gathered round three of its sides;</p>

<p>a couple more men had elevated themselves on a chest of drawers;</p>

<p>another rested on the oak-carved "cwoffer"; two on the wash-stand;</p>

<p>another on the stool; and thus all were, somehow, seated at their</p>

<p>ease.  The stage of mental comfort to which they had arrived at this</p>

<p>hour was one wherein their souls expanded beyond their skins, and</p>

<p>spread their personalities warmly through the room.  In this process</p>

<p>the chamber and its furniture grew more and more dignified and</p>

<p>luxurious; the shawl hanging at the window took upon itself the</p>

<p>richness of tapestry; the brass handles of the chest of drawers were</p>

<p>as golden knockers; and the carved bedposts seemed to have some</p>

<p>kinship with the magnificent pillars of Solomon's temple.</p>

<p>Mrs Durbeyfield, having quickly walked hitherward after parting from</p>

<p>Tess, opened the front door, crossed the downstairs room, which was</p>

<p>in deep gloom, and then unfastened the stair-door like one whose</p>

<p>fingers knew the tricks of the latches well.  Her ascent of the</p>

<p>crooked staircase was a slower process, and her face, as it rose into</p>

<p>the light above the last stair, encountered the gaze of all the party</p>

<p>assembled in the bedroom.</p>

<p>"--Being a few private friends I've asked in to keep up club-walking</p>

<p>at my own expense," the landlady exclaimed at the sound of footsteps,</p>

<p>as glibly as a child repeating the Catechism, while she peered over</p>

<p>the stairs.  "Oh, 'tis you, Mrs Durbeyfield--Lard--how you frightened</p>

<p>me!--I thought it might be some gaffer sent by Gover'ment."</p>

<p>Mrs Durbeyfield was welcomed with glances and nods by the remainder</p>

<p>of the conclave, and turned to where her husband sat.  He was humming</p>

<p>absently to himself, in a low tone: "I be as good as some folks here</p>

<p>and there!  I've got a great family vault at Kingsbere-sub-Greenhill,</p>

<p>and finer skillentons than any man in Wessex!"</p>

<p>"I've something to tell 'ee that's come into my head about that--a</p>

<p>grand projick!" whispered his cheerful wife.  "Here, John, don't 'ee</p>

<p>see me?"  She nudged him, while he, looking through her as through a</p>

<p>window-pane, went on with his recitative.</p>

<p>"Hush!  Don't 'ee sing so loud, my good man," said the landlady; "in</p>

<p>case any member of the Gover'ment should be passing, and take away my</p>

<p>licends."</p>

<p>"He's told 'ee what's happened to us, I suppose?" asked Mrs</p>

<p>Durbeyfield.</p>

<p>"Yes--in a way.  D'ye think there's any money hanging by it?"</p>

<p>"Ah, that's the secret," said Joan Durbeyfield sagely.  "However,</p>

<p>'tis well to be kin to a coach, even if you don't ride in 'en."  She</p>

<p>dropped her public voice, and continued in a low tone to her husband:</p>

<p>"I've been thinking since you brought the news that there's a great</p>

<p>rich lady out by Trantridge, on the edge o' The Chase, of the name of</p>

<p>d'Urberville."</p>

<p>"Hey--what's that?" said Sir John.</p>

<p>She repeated the information.  "That lady must be our relation," she</p>

<p>said.  "And my projick is to send Tess to claim kin."</p>

<p>"There IS a lady of the name, now you mention it," said Durbeyfield.</p>

<p>"Pa'son Tringham didn't think of that.  But she's nothing beside</p>

<p>we--a junior branch of us, no doubt, hailing long since King Norman's</p>

<p>day."</p>

<p>While this question was being discussed neither of the pair noticed,</p>

<p>in their preoccupation, that little Abraham had crept into the room,</p>

<p>and was awaiting an opportunity of asking them to return.</p>

<p>"She is rich, and she'd be sure to take notice o' the maid,"</p>

<p>continued Mrs Durbeyfield; "and 'twill be a very good thing.  I don't</p>

<p>see why two branches o' one family should not be on visiting terms."</p>

<p>"Yes; and we'll all claim kin!" said Abraham brightly from under the</p>

<p>bedstead.  "And we'll all go and see her when Tess has gone to live</p>

<p>with her; and we'll ride in her coach and wear black clothes!"</p>

<p>"How do you come here, child?  What nonsense be ye talking!  Go away,</p>

<p>and play on the stairs till father and mother be ready! ...  Well,</p>

<p>Tess ought to go to this other member of our family.  She'd be sure</p>

<p>to win the lady--Tess would; and likely enough 'twould lead to some</p>

<p>noble gentleman marrying her.  In short, I know it."</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"I tried her fate in the _Fortune-Teller_, and it brought out that</p>

<p>very thing! ...  You should ha' seen how pretty she looked to-day;</p>

<p>her skin is as sumple as a duchess'."</p>

<p>"What says the maid herself to going?"</p>

<p>"I've not asked her.  She don't know there is any such lady-relation</p>

<p>yet.  But it would certainly put her in the way of a grand marriage,</p>

<p>and she won't say nay to going."</p>

<p>"Tess is queer."</p>

<p>"But she's tractable at bottom.  Leave her to me."</p>

<p>Though this conversation had been private, sufficient of its import</p>

<p>reached the understandings of those around to suggest to them that</p>

<p>the Durbeyfields had weightier concerns to talk of now than common</p>

<p>folks had, and that Tess, their pretty eldest daughter, had fine</p>

<p>prospects in store.</p>

<p>"Tess is a fine figure o' fun, as I said to myself to-day when I zeed</p>

<p>her vamping round parish with the rest," observed one of the elderly</p>

<p>boozers in an undertone.  "But Joan Durbeyfield must mind that she</p>

<p>don't get green malt in floor."  It was a local phrase which had a</p>

<p>peculiar meaning, and there was no reply.</p>

<p>The conversation became inclusive, and presently other footsteps were</p>

<p>heard crossing the room below.</p>

<p>"--Being a few private friends asked in to-night to keep up</p>

<p>club-walking at my own expense."  The landlady had rapidly re-used</p>

<p>the formula she kept on hand for intruders before she recognized that</p>

<p>the newcomer was Tess.</p>

<p>Even to her mother's gaze the girl's young features looked sadly</p>

<p>out of place amid the alcoholic vapours which floated here as</p>

<p>no unsuitable medium for wrinkled middle-age; and hardly was a</p>

<p>reproachful flash from Tess's dark eyes needed to make her father</p>

<p>and mother rise from their seats, hastily finish their ale, and</p>

<p>descend the stairs behind her, Mrs Rolliver's caution following</p>

<p>their footsteps.</p>

<p>"No noise, please, if ye'll be so good, my dears; or I mid lose my</p>

<p>licends, and be summons'd, and I don't know what all!  'Night t'ye!"</p>

<p>They went home together, Tess holding one arm of her father, and Mrs</p>

<p>Durbeyfield the other.  He had, in truth, drunk very little--not a</p>

<p>fourth of the quantity which a systematic tippler could carry to</p>

<p>church on a Sunday afternoon without a hitch in his eastings or</p>

<p>genuflections; but the weakness of Sir John's constitution made</p>

<p>mountains of his petty sins in this kind.  On reaching the fresh</p>

<p>air he was sufficiently unsteady to incline the row of three at one</p>

<p>moment as if they were marching to London, and at another as if they</p>

<p>were marching to Bath--which produced a comical effect, frequent</p>

<p>enough in families on nocturnal homegoings; and, like most comical</p>

<p>effects, not quite so comic after all.  The two women valiantly</p>

<p>disguised these forced excursions and countermarches as well as they</p>

<p>could from Durbeyfield, their cause, and from Abraham, and from</p>

<p>themselves; and so they approached by degrees their own door, the</p>

<p>head of the family bursting suddenly into his former refrain as he</p>

<p>drew near, as if to fortify his soul at sight of the smallness of</p>

<p>his present residence--</p>

<p>"I've got a fam--ily vault at Kingsbere!"</p>

<p>"Hush--don't be so silly, Jacky," said his wife.  "Yours is not the</p>

<p>only family that was of 'count in wold days.  Look at the Anktells,</p>

<p>and Horseys, and the Tringhams themselves--gone to seed a'most as</p>

<p>much as you--though you was bigger folks than they, that's true.</p>

<p>Thank God, I was never of no family, and have nothing to be ashamed</p>

<p>of in that way!"</p>

<p>"Don't you be so sure o' that.  From you nater 'tis my belief you've</p>

<p>disgraced yourselves more than any o' us, and was kings and queens</p>

<p>outright at one time."</p>

<p>Tess turned the subject by saying what was far more prominent in her</p>

<p>own mind at the moment than thoughts of her ancestry--"I am afraid</p>

<p>father won't be able to take the journey with the beehives to-morrow</p>

<p>so early."</p>

<p>"I? I shall be all right in an hour or two," said Durbeyfield.</p>

<p>It was eleven o'clock before the family were all in bed, and</p>

<p>two o'clock next morning was the latest hour for starting with</p>

<p>the beehives if they were to be delivered to the retailers in</p>

<p>Casterbridge before the Saturday market began, the way thither lying</p>

<p>by bad roads over a distance of between twenty and thirty miles, and</p>

<p>the horse and waggon being of the slowest.  At half-past one Mrs</p>

<p>Durbeyfield came into the large bedroom where Tess and all her</p>

<p>little brothers and sisters slept.</p>

<p>"The poor man can't go," she said to her eldest daughter, whose great</p>

<p>eyes had opened the moment her mother's hand touched the door.</p>

<p>Tess sat up in bed, lost in a vague interspace between a dream and</p>

<p>this information.</p>

<p>"But somebody must go," she replied.  "It is late for the hives</p>

<p>already.  Swarming will soon be over for the year; and it we put off</p>

<p>taking 'em till next week's market the call for 'em will be past, and</p>

<p>they'll be thrown on our hands."</p>

<p>Mrs Durbeyfield looked unequal to the emergency.  "Some young feller,</p>

<p>perhaps, would go?  One of them who were so much after dancing with</p>

<p>'ee yesterday," she presently suggested.</p>

<p>"O no--I wouldn't have it for the world!" declared Tess proudly.</p>

<p>"And letting everybody know the reason--such a thing to be ashamed</p>

<p>of!  I think _I_ could go if Abraham could go with me to kip me</p>

<p>company."</p>

<p>Her mother at length agreed to this arrangement.  Little Abraham was</p>

<p>aroused from his deep sleep in a corner of the same apartment, and</p>

<p>made to put on his clothes while still mentally in the other world.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Tess had hastily dressed herself; and the twain, lighting</p>

<p>a lantern, went out to the stable.  The rickety little waggon was</p>

<p>already laden, and the girl led out the horse, Prince, only a degree</p>

<p>less rickety than the vehicle.</p>

<p>The poor creature looked wonderingly round at the night, at the</p>

<p>lantern, at their two figures, as if he could not believe that at</p>

<p>that hour, when every living thing was intended to be in shelter and</p>

<p>at rest, he was called upon to go out and labour.  They put a stock</p>

<p>of candle-ends into the lantern, hung the latter to the off-side of</p>

<p>the load, and directed the horse onward, walking at his shoulder at</p>

<p>first during the uphill parts of the way, in order not to overload</p>

<p>an animal of so little vigour.  To cheer themselves as well as they</p>

<p>could, they made an artificial morning with the lantern, some bread</p>

<p>and butter, and their own conversation, the real morning being far</p>

<p>from come.  Abraham, as he more fully awoke (for he had moved in a</p>

<p>sort of trance so far), began to talk of the strange shapes assumed</p>

<p>by the various dark objects against the sky; of this tree that looked</p>

<p>like a raging tiger springing from a lair; of that which resembled a</p>

<p>giant's head.</p>

<p>When they had passed the little town of Stourcastle, dumbly somnolent</p>

<p>under its thick brown thatch, they reached higher ground.  Still</p>

<p>higher, on their left, the elevation called Bulbarrow, or Bealbarrow,</p>

<p>well-nigh the highest in South Wessex, swelled into the sky,</p>

<p>engirdled by its earthen trenches.  From hereabout the long road was</p>

<p>fairly level for some distance onward.  They mounted in front of the</p>

<p>waggon, and Abraham grew reflective.</p>

<p>"Tess!" he said in a preparatory tone, after a silence.</p>

<p>"Yes, Abraham."</p>

<p>"Bain't you glad that we've become gentlefolk?"</p>

<p>"Not particular glad."</p>

<p>"But you be glad that you 'm going to marry a gentleman?"</p>

<p>"What?" said Tess, lifting her face.</p>

<p>"That our great relation will help 'ee to marry a gentleman."</p>

<p>"I?  Our great relation?  We have no such relation.  What has put</p>

<p>that into your head?"</p>

<p>"I heard 'em talking about it up at Rolliver's when I went to find</p>

<p>father.  There's a rich lady of our family out at Trantridge, and</p>

<p>mother said that if you claimed kin with the lady, she'd put 'ee in</p>

<p>the way of marrying a gentleman."</p>

<p>His sister became abruptly still, and lapsed into a pondering</p>

<p>silence.  Abraham talked on, rather for the pleasure of utterance</p>

<p>than for audition, so that his sister's abstraction was of no</p>

<p>account.  He leant back against the hives, and with upturned face</p>

<p>made observations on the stars, whose cold pulses were beating</p>

<p>amid the black hollows above, in serene dissociation from these two</p>

<p>wisps of human life.  He asked how far away those twinklers were,</p>

<p>and whether God was on the other side of them.  But ever and anon</p>

<p>his childish prattle recurred to what impressed his imagination</p>

<p>even more deeply than the wonders of creation.  If Tess were made</p>

<p>rich by marrying a gentleman, would she have money enough to buy a</p>

<p>spyglass so large that it would draw the stars as near to her as</p>

<p>Nettlecombe-Tout?</p>

<p>The renewed subject, which seemed to have impregnated the whole</p>

<p>family, filled Tess with impatience.</p>

<p>"Never mind that now!" she exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Did you say the stars were worlds, Tess?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"All like ours?"</p>

<p>"I don't know; but I think so.  They sometimes seem to be like the</p>

<p>apples on our stubbard-tree.  Most of them splendid and sound--a few</p>

<p>blighted."</p>

<p>"Which do we live on--a splendid one or a blighted one?"</p>

<p>"A blighted one."</p>

<p>"'Tis very unlucky that we didn't pitch on a sound one, when there</p>

<p>were so many more of 'em!"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Is it like that REALLY, Tess?" said Abraham, turning to her much</p>

<p>impressed, on reconsideration of this rare information.  "How would</p>

<p>it have been if we had pitched on a sound one?"</p>

<p>"Well, father wouldn't have coughed and creeped about as he does,</p>

<p>and wouldn't have got too tipsy to go on this journey; and mother</p>

<p>wouldn't have been always washing, and never getting finished."</p>

<p>"And you would have been a rich lady ready-made, and not have had to</p>

<p>be made rich by marrying a gentleman?"</p>

<p>"O Aby, don't--don't talk of that any more!"</p>

<p>Left to his reflections Abraham soon grew drowsy.  Tess was not</p>

<p>skilful in the management of a horse, but she thought that she could</p>

<p>take upon herself the entire conduct of the load for the present and</p>

<p>allow Abraham to go to sleep if he wished to do so.  She made him a</p>

<p>sort of nest in front of the hives, in such a manner that he could</p>

<p>not fall, and, taking the reins into her own hands, jogged on as</p>

<p>before.</p>

<p>Prince required but slight attention, lacking energy for superfluous</p>

<p>movements of any sort.  With no longer a companion to distract her,</p>

<p>Tess fell more deeply into reverie than ever, her back leaning</p>

<p>against the hives.  The mute procession past her shoulders of trees</p>

<p>and hedges became attached to fantastic scenes outside reality, and</p>

<p>the occasional heave of the wind became the sigh of some immense sad</p>

<p>soul, conterminous with the universe in space, and with history in</p>

<p>time.</p>

<p>Then, examining the mesh of events in her own life, she seemed to see</p>

<p>the vanity of her father's pride; the gentlemanly suitor awaiting</p>

<p>herself in her mother's fancy; to see him as a grimacing personage,</p>

<p>laughing at her poverty and her shrouded knightly ancestry.</p>

<p>Everything grew more and more extravagant, and she no longer knew how</p>

<p>time passed.  A sudden jerk shook her in her seat, and Tess awoke</p>

<p>from the sleep into which she, too, had fallen.</p>

<p>They were a long way further on than when she had lost consciousness,</p>

<p>and the waggon had stopped.  A hollow groan, unlike anything she had</p>

<p>ever heard in her life, came from the front, followed by a shout of</p>

<p>"Hoi there!"</p>

<p>The lantern hanging at her waggon had gone out, but another was</p>

<p>shining in her face--much brighter than her own had been.  Something</p>

<p>terrible had happened.  The harness was entangled with an object</p>

<p>which blocked the way.</p>

<p>In consternation Tess jumped down, and discovered the dreadful truth.</p>

<p>The groan had proceeded from her father's poor horse Prince.  The</p>

<p>morning mail-cart, with its two noiseless wheels, speeding along</p>

<p>these lanes like an arrow, as it always did, had driven into her slow</p>

<p>and unlighted equipage.  The pointed shaft of the cart had entered</p>

<p>the breast of the unhappy Prince like a sword, and from the wound his</p>

<p>life's blood was spouting in a stream, and falling with a hiss into</p>

<p>the road.</p>

<p>In her despair Tess sprang forward and put her hand upon the hole,</p>

<p>with the only result that she became splashed from face to skirt with</p>

<p>the crimson drops.  Then she stood helplessly looking on.  Prince</p>

<p>also stood firm and motionless as long as he could; till he suddenly</p>

<p>sank down in a heap.</p>

<p>By this time the mail-cart man had joined her, and began dragging and</p>

<p>unharnessing the hot form of Prince.  But he was already dead, and,</p>

<p>seeing that nothing more could be done immediately, the mail-cart man</p>

<p>returned to his own animal, which was uninjured.</p>

<p>"You was on the wrong side," he said.  "I am bound to go on with the</p>

<p>mail-bags, so that the best thing for you to do is bide here with</p>

<p>your load.  I'll send somebody to help you as soon as I can.  It is</p>

<p>getting daylight, and you have nothing to fear."</p>

<p>He mounted and sped on his way; while Tess stood and waited.  The</p>

<p>atmosphere turned pale, the birds shook themselves in the hedges,</p>

<p>arose, and twittered; the lane showed all its white features, and</p>

<p>Tess showed hers, still whiter.  The huge pool of blood in front of</p>

<p>her was already assuming the iridescence of coagulation; and when the</p>

<p>sun rose a hundred prismatic hues were reflected from it.  Prince lay</p>

<p>alongside, still and stark; his eyes half open, the hole in his chest</p>

<p>looking scarcely large enough to have let out all that had animated</p>

<p>him.</p>

<p>"'Tis all my doing--all mine!" the girl cried, gazing at the</p>

<p>spectacle.  "No excuse for me--none.  What will mother and father</p>

<p>live on now?  Aby, Aby!"  She shook the child, who had slept soundly</p>

<p>through the whole disaster.  "We can't go on with our load--Prince</p>

<p>is killed!"</p>

<p>When Abraham realized all, the furrows of fifty years were</p>

<p>extemporized on his young face.</p>

<p>"Why, I danced and laughed only yesterday!" she went on to herself.</p>

<p>"To think that I was such a fool!"</p>

<p>"'Tis because we be on a blighted star, and not a sound one, isn't</p>

<p>it, Tess?" murmured Abraham through his tears.</p>

<p>In silence they waited through an interval which seemed endless.  At</p>

<p>length a sound, and an approaching object, proved to them that the</p>

<p>driver of the mail-car had been as good as his word.  A farmer's</p>

<p>man from near Stourcastle came up, leading a strong cob.  He was</p>

<p>harnessed to the waggon of beehives in the place of Prince, and the</p>

<p>load taken on towards Casterbridge.</p>

<p>The evening of the same day saw the empty waggon reach again the</p>

<p>spot of the accident.  Prince had lain there in the ditch since the</p>

<p>morning; but the place of the blood-pool was still visible in the</p>

<p>middle of the road, though scratched and scraped over by passing</p>

<p>vehicles.  All that was left of Prince was now hoisted into the</p>

<p>waggon he had formerly hauled, and with his hoofs in the air, and his</p>

<p>shoes shining in the setting sunlight, he retraced the eight or nine</p>

<p>miles to Marlott.</p>

<p>Tess had gone back earlier.  How to break the news was more than she</p>

<p>could think.  It was a relief to her tongue to find from the faces of</p>

<p>her parents that they already knew of their loss, though this did not</p>

<p>lessen the self-reproach which she continued to heap upon herself for</p>

<p>her negligence.</p>

<p>But the very shiftlessness of the household rendered the misfortune</p>

<p>a less terrifying one to them than it would have been to a thriving</p>

<p>family, though in the present case it meant ruin, and in the other it</p>

<p>would only have meant inconvenience.  In the Durbeyfield countenances</p>

<p>there was nothing of the red wrath that would have burnt upon the</p>

<p>girl from parents more ambitious for her welfare.  Nobody blamed Tess</p>

<p>as she blamed herself.</p>

<p>When it was discovered that the knacker and tanner would give only a</p>

<p>very few shillings for Prince's carcase because of his decrepitude,</p>

<p>Durbeyfield rose to the occasion.</p>

<p>"No," said he stoically, "I won't sell his old body.  When we</p>

<p>d'Urbervilles was knights in the land, we didn't sell our chargers</p>

<p>for cat's meat.  Let 'em keep their shillings!  He've served me well</p>

<p>in his lifetime, and I won't part from him now."</p>

<p>He worked harder the next day in digging a grave for Prince in the</p>

<p>garden than he had worked for months to grow a crop for his family.</p>

<p>When the hole was ready, Durbeyfield and his wife tied a rope round</p>

<p>the horse and dragged him up the path towards it, the children</p>

<p>following in funeral train.  Abraham and 'Liza-Lu sobbed, Hope and</p>

<p>Modesty discharged their griefs in loud blares which echoed from the</p>

<p>walls; and when Prince was tumbled in they gathered round the grave.</p>

<p>The bread-winner had been taken away from them; what would they do?</p>

<p>"Is he gone to heaven?" asked Abraham, between the sobs.</p>

<p>Then Durbeyfield began to shovel in the earth, and the children cried</p>

<p>anew.  All except Tess.  Her face was dry and pale, as though she</p>

<p>regarded herself in the light of a murderess.</p>

<p>V</p>

<p>The haggling business, which had mainly depended on the horse, became</p>

<p>disorganized forthwith.  Distress, if not penury, loomed in the</p>

<p>distance.  Durbeyfield was what was locally called a slack-twisted</p>

<p>fellow; he had good strength to work at times; but the times could</p>

<p>not be relied on to coincide with the hours of requirement; and,</p>

<p>having been unaccustomed to the regular toil of the day-labourer,</p>

<p>he was not particularly persistent when they did so coincide.</p>

<p>Tess, meanwhile, as the one who had dragged her parents into this</p>

<p>quagmire, was silently wondering what she could do to help them out</p>

<p>of it; and then her mother broached her scheme.</p>

<p>"We must take the ups wi' the downs, Tess," said she; "and never</p>

<p>could your high blood have been found out at a more called-for</p>

<p>moment.  You must try your friends.  Do ye know that there is a very</p>

<p>rich Mrs d'Urberville living on the outskirts o' The Chase, who must</p>

<p>be our relation?  You must go to her and claim kin, and ask for some</p>

<p>help in our trouble."</p>

<p>"I shouldn't care to do that," says Tess.  "If there is such a lady,</p>

<p>'twould be enough for us if she were friendly--not to expect her to</p>

<p>give us help."</p>

<p>"You could win her round to do anything, my dear.  Besides, perhaps</p>

<p>there's more in it than you know of. I've heard what I've heard,</p>

<p>good-now."</p>

<p>The oppressive sense of the harm she had done led Tess to be more</p>

<p>deferential than she might otherwise have been to the maternal</p>

<p>wish; but she could not understand why her mother should find such</p>

<p>satisfaction in contemplating an enterprise of, to her, such doubtful</p>

<p>profit.  Her mother might have made inquiries, and have discovered</p>

<p>that this Mrs d'Urberville was a lady of unequalled virtues and</p>

<p>charity.  But Tess's pride made the part of poor relation one of</p>

<p>particular distaste to her.</p>

<p>"I'd rather try to get work," she murmured.</p>

<p>"Durbeyfield, you can settle it," said his wife, turning to where he</p>

<p>sat in the background.  "If you say she ought to go, she will go."</p>

<p>"I don't like my children going and making themselves beholden to</p>

<p>strange kin," murmured he.  "I'm the head of the noblest branch o'</p>

<p>the family, and I ought to live up to it."</p>

<p>His reasons for staying away were worse to Tess than her own</p>

<p>objections to going.  "Well, as I killed the horse, mother," she said</p>

<p>mournfully, "I suppose I ought to do something.  I don't mind going</p>

<p>and seeing her, but you must leave it to me about asking for help.</p>

<p>And don't go thinking about her making a match for me--it is silly."</p>

<p>"Very well said, Tess!" observed her father sententiously.</p>

<p>"Who said I had such a thought?" asked Joan.</p>

<p>"I fancy it is in your mind, mother.  But I'll go."</p>

<p>Rising early next day she walked to the hill-town called Shaston,</p>

<p>and there took advantage of a van which twice in the week ran from</p>

<p>Shaston eastward to Chaseborough, passing near Trantridge, the parish</p>

<p>in which the vague and mysterious Mrs d'Urberville had her residence.</p>

<p>Tess Durbeyfield's route on this memorable morning lay amid the</p>

<p>north-eastern undulations of the Vale in which she had been born, and</p>

<p>in which her life had unfolded.  The Vale of Blackmoor was to her the</p>

<p>world, and its inhabitants the races thereof.  From the gates and</p>

<p>stiles of Marlott she had looked down its length in the wondering</p>

<p>days of infancy, and what had been mystery to her then was not</p>

<p>much less than mystery to her now.  She had seen daily from her</p>

<p>chamber-window towers, villages, faint white mansions; above all,</p>

<p>the town of Shaston standing majestically on its height; its windows</p>

<p>shining like lamps in the evening sun.  She had hardly ever visited</p>

<p>the place, only a small tract even of the Vale and its environs being</p>

<p>known to her by close inspection.  Much less had she been far outside</p>

<p>the valley.  Every contour of the surrounding hills was as personal</p>

<p>to her as that of her relatives' faces; but for what lay beyond, her</p>

<p>judgment was dependent on the teaching of the village school, where</p>

<p>she had held a leading place at the time of her leaving, a year or</p>

<p>two before this date.</p>

<p>In those early days she had been much loved by others of her own</p>

<p>sex and age, and had used to be seen about the village as one of</p>

<p>three--all nearly of the same year--walking home from school side</p>

<p>by side; Tess the middle one--in a pink print pinafore, of a finely</p>

<p>reticulated pattern, worn over a stuff frock that had lost its</p>

<p>original colour for a nondescript tertiary--marching on upon long</p>

<p>stalky legs, in tight stockings which had little ladder-like holes</p>

<p>at the knees, torn by kneeling in the roads and banks in search of</p>

<p>vegetable and mineral treasures; her then earth-coloured hair hanging</p>

<p>like pot-hooks; the arms of the two outside girls resting round the</p>

<p>waist of Tess; her arms on the shoulders of the two supporters.</p>

<p>As Tess grew older, and began to see how matters stood, she felt</p>

<p>quite a Malthusian towards her mother for thoughtlessly giving her so</p>

<p>many little sisters and brothers, when it was such a trouble to nurse</p>

<p>and provide for them.  Her mother's intelligence was that of a happy</p>

<p>child: Joan Durbeyfield was simply an additional one, and that not</p>

<p>the eldest, to her own long family of waiters on Providence.</p>

<p>However, Tess became humanely beneficent towards the small ones,</p>

<p>and to help them as much as possible she used, as soon as she left</p>

<p>school, to lend a hand at haymaking or harvesting on neighbouring</p>

<p>farms; or, by preference, at milking or butter-making processes,</p>

<p>which she had learnt when her father had owned cows; and being</p>

<p>deft-fingered it was a kind of work in which she excelled.</p>

<p>Every day seemed to throw upon her young shoulders more of the</p>

<p>family burdens, and that Tess should be the representative of the</p>

<p>Durbeyfields at the d'Urberville mansion came as a thing of course.</p>

<p>In this instance it must be admitted that the Durbeyfields were</p>

<p>putting their fairest side outward.</p>

<p>She alighted from the van at Trantridge Cross, and ascended on foot</p>

<p>a hill in the direction of the district known as The Chase, on the</p>

<p>borders of which, as she had been informed, Mrs d'Urberville's seat,</p>

<p>The Slopes, would be found.  It was not a manorial home in the</p>

<p>ordinary sense, with fields, and pastures, and a grumbling farmer,</p>

<p>out of whom the owner had to squeeze an income for himself and his</p>

<p>family by hook or by crook.  It was more, far more; a country-house</p>

<p>built for enjoyment pure and simple, with not an acre of troublesome</p>

<p>land attached to it beyond what was required for residential</p>

<p>purposes, and for a little fancy farm kept in hand by the owner, and</p>

<p>tended by a bailiff.</p>

<p>The crimson brick lodge came first in sight, up to its eaves in dense</p>

<p>evergreens.  Tess thought this was the mansion itself till, passing</p>

<p>through the side wicket with some trepidation, and onward to a point</p>

<p>at which the drive took a turn, the house proper stood in full view.</p>

<p>It was of recent erection--indeed almost new--and of the same rich</p>

<p>red colour that formed such a contrast with the evergreens of the</p>

<p>lodge.  Far behind the corner of the house--which rose like a</p>

<p>geranium bloom against the subdued colours around--stretched the soft</p>

<p>azure landscape of The Chase--a truly venerable tract of forest land,</p>

<p>one of the few remaining woodlands in England of undoubted primaeval</p>

<p>date, wherein Druidical mistletoe was still found on aged oaks, and</p>

<p>where enormous yew-trees, not planted by the hand of man grew as</p>

<p>they had grown when they were pollarded for bows.  All this sylvan</p>

<p>antiquity, however, though visible from The Slopes, was outside the</p>

<p>immediate boundaries of the estate.</p>

<p>Everything on this snug property was bright, thriving, and well kept;</p>

<p>acres of glass-houses stretched down the inclines to the copses at</p>

<p>their feet.  Everything looked like money--like the last coin issued</p>

<p>from the Mint.  The stables, partly screened by Austrian pines</p>

<p>and evergreen oaks, and fitted with every late appliance, were</p>

<p>as dignified as Chapels-of-Ease.  On the extensive lawn stood an</p>

<p>ornamental tent, its door being towards her.</p>

<p>Simple Tess Durbeyfield stood at gaze, in a half-alarmed attitude,</p>

<p>on the edge of the gravel sweep.  Her feet had brought her onward to</p>

<p>this point before she had quite realized where she was; and now all</p>

<p>was contrary to her expectation.</p>

<p>"I thought we were an old family; but this is all new!" she said, in</p>

<p>her artlessness.  She wished that she had not fallen in so readily</p>

<p>with her mother's plans for "claiming kin," and had endeavoured to</p>

<p>gain assistance nearer home.</p>

<p>The d'Urbervilles--or Stoke-d'Urbervilles, as they at first called</p>

<p>themselves--who owned all this, were a somewhat unusual family to</p>

<p>find in such an old-fashioned part of the country.  Parson Tringham</p>

<p>had spoken truly when he said that our shambling John Durbeyfield was</p>

<p>the only really lineal representative of the old d'Urberville family</p>

<p>existing in the county, or near it; he might have added, what he knew</p>

<p>very well, that the Stoke-d'Urbervilles were no more d'Urbervilles of</p>

<p>the true tree then he was himself.  Yet it must be admitted that this</p>

<p>family formed a very good stock whereon to regraft a name which sadly</p>

<p>wanted such renovation.</p>

<p>When old Mr Simon Stoke, latterly deceased, had made his fortune as</p>

<p>an honest merchant (some said money-lender) in the North, he decided</p>

<p>to settle as a county man in the South of England, out of hail of</p>

<p>his business district; and in doing this he felt the necessity of</p>

<p>recommencing with a name that would not too readily identify him with</p>

<p>the smart tradesman of the past, and that would be less commonplace</p>

<p>than the original bald, stark words.  Conning for an hour in the</p>

<p>British Museum the pages of works devoted to extinct, half-extinct,</p>

<p>obscured, and ruined families appertaining to the quarter of England</p>

<p>in which he proposed to settle, he considered that _d'Urberville_</p>

<p>looked and sounded as well as any of them: and d'Urberville</p>

<p>accordingly was annexed to his own name for himself and his heirs</p>

<p>eternally.  Yet he was not an extravagant-minded man in this, and in</p>

<p>constructing his family tree on the new basis was duly reasonable in</p>

<p>framing his inter-marriages and aristocratic links, never inserting</p>

<p>a single title above a rank of strict moderation.</p>

<p>Of this work of imagination poor Tess and her parents were naturally</p>

<p>in ignorance--much to their discomfiture; indeed, the very</p>

<p>possibility of such annexations was unknown to them; who supposed</p>

<p>that, though to be well-favoured might be the gift of fortune, a</p>

<p>family name came by nature.</p>

<p>Tess still stood hesitating like a bather about to make his plunge,</p>

<p>hardly knowing whether to retreat or to persevere, when a figure came</p>

<p>forth from the dark triangular door of the tent.  It was that of a</p>

<p>tall young man, smoking.</p>

<p>He had an almost swarthy complexion, with full lips, badly moulded,</p>

<p>though red and smooth, above which was a well-groomed black moustache</p>

<p>with curled points, though his age could not be more than three- or</p>

<p>four-and-twenty.  Despite the touches of barbarism in his contours,</p>

<p>there was a singular force in the gentleman's face, and in his bold</p>

<p>rolling eye.</p>

<p>"Well, my Beauty, what can I do for you?" said he, coming forward.</p>

<p>And perceiving that she stood quite confounded: "Never mind me. I am</p>

<p>Mr d'Urberville.  Have you come to see me or my mother?"</p>

<p>This embodiment of a d'Urberville and a namesake differed even more</p>

<p>from what Tess had expected than the house and grounds had differed.</p>

<p>She had dreamed of an aged and dignified face, the sublimation of</p>

<p>all the d'Urberville lineaments, furrowed with incarnate memories</p>

<p>representing in hieroglyphic the centuries of her family's and</p>

<p>England's history.  But she screwed herself up to the work in hand,</p>

<p>since she could not get out of it, and answered--</p>

<p>"I came to see your mother, sir."</p>

<p>"I am afraid you cannot see her--she is an invalid," replied the</p>

<p>present representative of the spurious house; for this was Mr Alec,</p>

<p>the only son of the lately deceased gentleman.  "Cannot I answer your</p>

<p>purpose? What is the business you wish to see her about?"</p>

<p>"It isn't business--it is--I can hardly say what!"</p>

<p>"Pleasure?"</p>

<p>"Oh no.  Why, sir, if I tell you, it will seem--"</p>

<p>Tess's sense of a certain ludicrousness in her errand was now</p>

<p>so strong that, notwithstanding her awe of him, and her general</p>

<p>discomfort at being here, her rosy lips curved towards a smile,</p>

<p>much to the attraction of the swarthy Alexander.</p>

<p>"It is so very foolish," she stammered; "I fear can't tell you!"</p>

<p>"Never mind; I like foolish things.  Try again, my dear," said he</p>

<p>kindly.</p>

<p>"Mother asked me to come," Tess continued; "and, indeed, I was in the</p>

<p>mind to do so myself likewise.  But I did not think it would be like</p>

<p>this.  I came, sir, to tell you that we are of the same family as</p>

<p>you."</p>

<p>"Ho!  Poor relations?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Stokes?"</p>

<p>"No; d'Urbervilles."</p>

<p>"Ay, ay; I mean d'Urbervilles."</p>

<p>"Our names are worn away to Durbeyfield; but we have several proofs</p>

<p>that we are d'Urbervilles.  Antiquarians hold we are,--and--and we</p>

<p>have an old seal, marked with a ramping lion on a shield, and a</p>

<p>castle over him.  And we have a very old silver spoon, round in the</p>

<p>bowl like a little ladle, and marked with the same castle.  But it</p>

<p>is so worn that mother uses it to stir the pea-soup."</p>

<p>"A castle argent is certainly my crest," said he blandly.  "And my</p>

<p>arms a lion rampant."</p>

<p>"And so mother said we ought to make ourselves beknown to you--as</p>

<p>we've lost our horse by a bad accident, and are the oldest branch o'</p>

<p>the family."</p>

<p>"Very kind of your mother, I'm sure.  And I, for one, don't regret</p>

<p>her step."  Alec looked at Tess as he spoke, in a way that made her</p>

<p>blush a little.  "And so, my pretty girl, you've come on a friendly</p>

<p>visit to us, as relations?"</p>

<p>"I suppose I have," faltered Tess, looking uncomfortable again.</p>

<p>"Well--there's no harm in it.  Where do you live?  What are you?"</p>

<p>She gave him brief particulars; and responding to further inquiries</p>

<p>told him that she was intending to go back by the same carrier who</p>

<p>had brought her.</p>

<p>"It is a long while before he returns past Trantridge Cross.</p>

<p>Supposing we walk round the grounds to pass the time, my pretty Coz?"</p>

<p>Tess wished to abridge her visit as much as possible; but the young</p>

<p>man was pressing, and she consented to accompany him.  He conducted</p>

<p>her about the lawns, and flower-beds, and conservatories; and thence</p>

<p>to the fruit-garden and greenhouses, where he asked her if she liked</p>

<p>strawberries.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Tess, "when they come."</p>

<p>"They are already here."  D'Urberville began gathering specimens</p>

<p>of the fruit for her, handing them back to her as he stooped; and,</p>

<p>presently, selecting a specially fine product of the "British Queen"</p>

<p>variety, he stood up and held it by the stem to her mouth.</p>

<p>"No--no!" she said quickly, putting her fingers between his hand and</p>

<p>her lips.  "I would rather take it in my own hand."</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" he insisted; and in a slight distress she parted her lips</p>

<p>and took it in.</p>

<p>They had spent some time wandering desultorily thus, Tess eating in</p>

<p>a half-pleased, half-reluctant state whatever d'Urberville offered</p>

<p>her.  When she could consume no more of the strawberries he filled</p>

<p>her little basket with them; and then the two passed round to the</p>

<p>rose-trees, whence he gathered blossoms and gave her to put in her</p>

<p>bosom. She obeyed like one in a dream, and when she could affix no</p>

<p>more he himself tucked a bud or two into her hat, and heaped her</p>

<p>basket with others in the prodigality of his bounty.  At last,</p>

<p>looking at his watch, he said, "Now, by the time you have had</p>

<p>something to eat, it will be time for you to leave, if you want to</p>

<p>catch the carrier to Shaston.  Come here, and I'll see what grub I</p>

<p>can find."</p>

<p>Stoke d'Urberville took her back to the lawn and into the tent, where</p>

<p>he left her, soon reappearing with a basket of light luncheon, which</p>

<p>he put before her himself.  It was evidently the gentleman's wish not</p>

<p>to be disturbed in this pleasant _tкte-а-tкte_ by the servantry.</p>

<p>"Do you mind my smoking?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, not at all, sir."</p>

<p>He watched her pretty and unconscious munching through the skeins of</p>

<p>smoke that pervaded the tent, and Tess Durbeyfield did not divine,</p>

<p>as she innocently looked down at the roses in her bosom, that there</p>

<p>behind the blue narcotic haze was potentially the "tragic mischief"</p>

<p>of her drama--one who stood fair to be the blood-red ray in the</p>

<p>spectrum of her young life.  She had an attribute which amounted</p>

<p>to a disadvantage just now; and it was this that caused Alec</p>

<p>d'Urberville's eyes to rivet themselves upon her.  It was a</p>

<p>luxuriance of aspect, a fulness of growth, which made her appear more</p>

<p>of a woman than she really was.  She had inherited the feature from</p>

<p>her mother without the quality it denoted.  It had troubled her mind</p>

<p>occasionally, till her companions had said that it was a fault which</p>

<p>time would cure.</p>

<p>She soon had finished her lunch.  "Now I am going home, sir," she</p>

<p>said, rising.</p>

<p>"And what do they call you?" he asked, as he accompanied her along</p>

<p>the drive till they were out of sight of the house.</p>

<p>"Tess Durbeyfield, down at Marlott."</p>

<p>"And you say your people have lost their horse?"</p>

<p>"I--killed him!" she answered, her eyes filling with tears as she</p>

<p>gave particulars of Prince's death.  "And I don't know what to do</p>

<p>for father on account of it!"</p>

<p>"I must think if I cannot do something.  My mother must find a berth</p>

<p>for you.  But, Tess, no nonsense about 'd'Urberville';--'Durbeyfield'</p>

<p>only, you know--quite another name."</p>

<p>"I wish for no better, sir," said she with something of dignity.</p>

<p>For a moment--only for a moment--when they were in the turning of the</p>

<p>drive, between the tall rhododendrons and conifers, before the lodge</p>

<p>became visible, he inclined his face towards her as if--but, no: he</p>

<p>thought better of it, and let her go.</p>

<p>Thus the thing began.  Had she perceived this meeting's import she</p>

<p>might have asked why she was doomed to be seen and coveted that day</p>

<p>by the wrong man, and not by some other man, the right and desired</p>

<p>one in all respects--as nearly as humanity can supply the right</p>

<p>and desired; yet to him who amongst her acquaintance might have</p>

<p>approximated to this kind, she was but a transient impression, half</p>

<p>forgotten.</p>

<p>In the ill-judged execution of the well-judged plan of things the</p>

<p>call seldom produces the comer, the man to love rarely coincides with</p>

<p>the hour for loving.  Nature does not often say "See!" to her poor</p>

<p>creature at a time when seeing can lead to happy doing; or reply</p>

<p>"Here!" to a body's cry of "Where?" till the hide-and-seek has become</p>

<p>an irksome, outworn game.  We may wonder whether at the acme and</p>

<p>summit of the human progress these anachronisms will be corrected by</p>

<p>a finer intuition, a closer interaction of the social machinery than</p>

<p>that which now jolts us round and along; but such completeness is not</p>

<p>to be prophesied, or even conceived as possible.  Enough that in the</p>

<p>present case, as in millions, it was not the two halves of a perfect</p>

<p>whole that confronted each other at the perfect moment; a missing</p>

<p>counterpart wandered independently about the earth waiting in</p>

<p>crass obtuseness till the late time came.  Out of which maladroit</p>

<p>delay sprang anxieties, disappointments, shocks, catastrophes, and</p>

<p>passing-strange destinies.</p>

<p>When d'Urberville got back to the tent he sat down astride on a</p>

<p>chair, reflecting, with a pleased gleam in his face.  Then he broke</p>

<p>into a loud laugh.</p>

<p>"Well, I'm damned!  What a funny thing!  Ha-ha-ha!  And what a crumby</p>

<p>girl!"</p>

<p>VI</p>

<p>Tess went down the hill to Trantridge Cross, and inattentively waited</p>

<p>to take her seat in the van returning from Chaseborough to Shaston.</p>

<p>She did not know what the other occupants said to her as she entered,</p>

<p>though she answered them; and when they had started anew she rode</p>

<p>along with an inward and not an outward eye.</p>

<p>One among her fellow-travellers addressed her more pointedly than</p>

<p>any had spoken before: "Why, you be quite a posy!  And such roses in</p>

<p>early June!"</p>

<p>Then she became aware of the spectacle she presented to their</p>

<p>surprised vision: roses at her breasts; roses in her hat; roses</p>

<p>and strawberries in her basket to the brim.  She blushed, and</p>

<p>said confusedly that the flowers had been given to her.  When the</p>

<p>passengers were not looking she stealthily removed the more prominent</p>

<p>blooms from her hat and placed them in the basket, where she covered</p>

<p>them with her handkerchief.  Then she fell to reflecting again, and</p>

<p>in looking downwards a thorn of the rose remaining in her breast</p>

<p>accidentally pricked her chin. Like all the cottagers in Blackmoor</p>

<p>Vale, Tess was steeped in fancies and prefigurative superstitions;</p>

<p>she thought this an ill omen--the first she had noticed that day.</p>

<p>The van travelled only so far as Shaston, and there were several</p>

<p>miles of pedestrian descent from that mountain-town into the vale to</p>

<p>Marlott.  Her mother had advised her to stay here for the night, at</p>

<p>the house of a cottage-woman they knew, if she should feel too tired</p>

<p>to come on; and this Tess did, not descending to her home till the</p>

<p>following afternoon.</p>

<p>When she entered the house she perceived in a moment from her</p>

<p>mother's triumphant manner that something had occurred in the</p>

<p>interim.</p>

<p>"Oh yes; I know all about it!  I told 'ee it would be all right, and</p>

<p>now 'tis proved!"</p>

<p>"Since I've been away?  What has?" said Tess rather wearily.</p>

<p>Her mother surveyed the girl up and down with arch approval, and went</p>

<p>on banteringly: "So you've brought 'em round!"</p>

<p>"How do you know, mother?"</p>

<p>"I've had a letter."</p>

<p>Tess then remembered that there would have been time for this.</p>

<p>"They say--Mrs d'Urberville says--that she wants you to look after a</p>

<p>little fowl-farm which is her hobby.  But this is only her artful way</p>

<p>of getting 'ee there without raising your hopes.  She's going to own</p>

<p>'ee as kin--that's the meaning o't."</p>

<p>"But I didn't see her."</p>

<p>"You zid somebody, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"I saw her son."</p>

<p>"And did he own 'ee?"</p>

<p>"Well--he called me Coz."</p>

<p>"An' I knew it!  Jacky--he called her Coz!" cried Joan to her</p>

<p>husband.  "Well, he spoke to his mother, of course, and she do want</p>

<p>'ee there."</p>

<p>"But I don't know that I am apt at tending fowls," said the dubious</p>

<p>Tess.</p>

<p>"Then I don't know who is apt.  You've be'n born in the business, and</p>

<p>brought up in it.  They that be born in a business always know more</p>

<p>about it than any 'prentice.  Besides, that's only just a show of</p>

<p>something for you to do, that you midn't feel beholden."</p>

<p>"I don't altogether think I ought to go," said Tess thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"Who wrote the letter?  Will you let me look at it?"</p>

<p>"Mrs d'Urberville wrote it.  Here it is."</p>

<p>The letter was in the third person, and briefly informed Mrs</p>

<p>Durbeyfield that her daughter's services would be useful to that lady</p>

<p>in the management of her poultry-farm, that a comfortable room would</p>

<p>be provided for her if she could come, and that the wages would be on</p>

<p>a liberal scale if they liked her.</p>

<p>"Oh--that's all!" said Tess.</p>

<p>"You couldn't expect her to throw her arms round 'ee, an' to kiss and</p>

<p>to coll 'ee all at once."</p>

<p>Tess looked out of the window.</p>

<p>"I would rather stay here with father and you," she said.</p>

<p>"But why?"</p>

<p>"I'd rather not tell you why, mother; indeed, I don't quite know</p>

<p>why."</p>

<p>A week afterwards she came in one evening from an unavailing search</p>

<p>for some light occupation in the immediate neighbourhood.  Her idea</p>

<p>had been to get together sufficient money during the summer to</p>

<p>purchase another horse.  Hardly had she crossed the threshold before</p>

<p>one of the children danced across the room, saying, "The gentleman's</p>

<p>been here!"</p>

<p>Her mother hastened to explain, smiles breaking from every inch of</p>

<p>her person.  Mrs d'Urberville's son had called on horseback, having</p>

<p>been riding by chance in the direction of Marlott.  He had wished</p>

<p>to know, finally, in the name of his mother, if Tess could really</p>

<p>come to manage the old lady's fowl-farm or not; the lad who had</p>

<p>hitherto superintended the birds having proved untrustworthy.  "Mr</p>

<p>d'Urberville says you must be a good girl if you are at all as you</p>

<p>appear; he knows you must be worth your weight in gold.  He is very</p>

<p>much interested in 'ee--truth to tell."</p>

<p>Tess seemed for the moment really pleased to hear that she had won</p>

<p>such high opinion from a stranger when, in her own esteem, she had</p>

<p>sunk so low.</p>

<p>"It is very good of him to think that," she murmured; "and if I was</p>

<p>quite sure how it would be living there, I would go any-when."</p>

<p>"He is a mighty handsome man!"</p>

<p>"I don't think so," said Tess coldly.</p>

<p>"Well, there's your chance, whether or no; and I'm sure he wears a</p>

<p>beautiful diamond ring!"</p>

<p>"Yes," said little Abraham, brightly, from the window-bench; "and</p>

<p>I seed it! and it did twinkle when he put his hand up to his</p>

<p>mistarshers.  Mother, why did our grand relation keep on putting his</p>

<p>hand up to his mistarshers?"</p>

<p>"Hark at that child!" cried Mrs Durbeyfield, with parenthetic</p>

<p>admiration.</p>

<p>"Perhaps to show his diamond ring," murmured Sir John, dreamily, from</p>

<p>his chair.</p>

<p>"I'll think it over," said Tess, leaving the room.</p>

<p>"Well, she's made a conquest o' the younger branch of us, straight</p>

<p>off," continued the matron to her husband, "and she's a fool if she</p>

<p>don't follow it up."</p>

<p>"I don't quite like my children going away from home," said the</p>

<p>haggler.  "As the head of the family, the rest ought to come to me."</p>

<p>"But do let her go, Jacky," coaxed his poor witless wife.  "He's</p>

<p>struck wi' her--you can see that. He called her Coz!  He'll marry</p>

<p>her, most likely, and make a lady of her; and then she'll be what</p>

<p>her forefathers was."</p>

<p>John Durbeyfield had more conceit than energy or health, and this</p>

<p>supposition was pleasant to him.</p>

<p>"Well, perhaps that's what young Mr d'Urberville means," he admitted;</p>

<p>"and sure enough he mid have serious thoughts about improving his</p>

<p>blood by linking on to the old line.  Tess, the little rogue!  And</p>

<p>have she really paid 'em a visit to such an end as this?"</p>

<p>Meanwhile Tess was walking thoughtfully among the gooseberry-bushes</p>

<p>in the garden, and over Prince's grave.  When she came in her mother</p>

<p>pursued her advantage.</p>

<p>"Well, what be you going to do?" she asked.</p>

<p>"I wish I had seen Mrs d'Urberville," said Tess.</p>

<p>"I think you mid as well settle it.  Then you'll see her soon</p>

<p>enough."</p>

<p>Her father coughed in his chair.</p>

<p>"I don't know what to say!" answered the girl restlessly.  "It is for</p>

<p>you to decide.  I killed the old horse, and I suppose I ought to do</p>

<p>something to get ye a new one.  But--but--I don't quite like Mr</p>

<p>d'Urberville being there!"</p>

<p>The children, who had made use of this idea of Tess being taken up by</p>

<p>their wealthy kinsfolk (which they imagined the other family to be)</p>

<p>as a species of dolorifuge after the death of the horse, began to cry</p>

<p>at Tess's reluctance, and teased and reproached her for hesitating.</p>

<p>"Tess won't go-o-o and be made a la-a-dy of!--no, she says she</p>

<p>wo-o-on't!" they wailed, with square mouths.  "And we shan't have a</p>

<p>nice new horse, and lots o' golden money to buy fairlings!  And Tess</p>

<p>won't look pretty in her best cloze no mo-o-ore!"</p>

<p>Her mother chimed in to the same tune: a certain way she had of</p>

<p>making her labours in the house seem heavier than they were by</p>

<p>prolonging them indefinitely, also weighed in the argument.  Her</p>

<p>father alone preserved an attitude of neutrality.</p>

<p>"I will go," said Tess at last.</p>

<p>Her mother could not repress her consciousness of the nuptial vision</p>

<p>conjured up by the girl's consent.</p>

<p>"That's right!  For such a pretty maid as 'tis, this is a fine</p>

<p>chance!"</p>

<p>Tess smiled crossly.</p>

<p>"I hope it is a chance for earning money.  It is no other kind of</p>

<p>chance.  You had better say nothing of that silly sort about parish."</p>

<p>Mrs Durbeyfield did not promise.  She was not quite sure that she did</p>

<p>not feel proud enough, after the visitor's remarks, to say a good</p>

<p>deal.</p>

<p>Thus it was arranged; and the young girl wrote, agreeing to be ready</p>

<p>to set out on any day on which she might be required.  She was duly</p>

<p>informed that Mrs d'Urberville was glad of her decision, and that a</p>

<p>spring-cart should be sent to meet her and her luggage at the top</p>

<p>of the Vale on the day after the morrow, when she must hold herself</p>

<p>prepared to start.  Mrs d'Urberville's handwriting seemed rather</p>

<p>masculine.</p>

<p>"A cart?" murmured Joan Durbeyfield doubtingly.  "It might have been</p>

<p>a carriage for her own kin!"</p>

<p>Having at last taken her course Tess was less restless and</p>

<p>abstracted, going about her business with some self-assurance in the</p>

<p>thought of acquiring another horse for her father by an occupation</p>

<p>which would not be onerous.  She had hoped to be a teacher at the</p>

<p>school, but the fates seemed to decide otherwise.  Being mentally</p>

<p>older than her mother she did not regard Mrs Durbeyfield's</p>

<p>matrimonial hopes for her in a serious aspect for a moment.  The</p>

<p>light-minded woman had been discovering good matches for her daughter</p>

<p>almost from the year of her birth.</p>

<p>VII</p>

<p>On the morning appointed for her departure Tess was awake before</p>

<p>dawn--at the marginal minute of the dark when the grove is still</p>

<p>mute, save for one prophetic bird who sings with a clear-voiced</p>

<p>conviction that he at least knows the correct time of day, the rest</p>

<p>preserving silence as if equally convinced that he is mistaken.  She</p>

<p>remained upstairs packing till breakfast-time, and then came down in</p>

<p>her ordinary week-day clothes, her Sunday apparel being carefully</p>

<p>folded in her box.</p>

<p>Her mother expostulated. "You will never set out to see your folks</p>

<p>without dressing up more the dand than that?"</p>

<p>"But I am going to work!" said Tess.</p>

<p>"Well, yes," said Mrs Durbeyfield; and in a private tone, "at first</p>

<p>there mid be a little pretence o't ...  But I think it will be wiser</p>

<p>of 'ee to put your best side outward," she added.</p>

<p>"Very well; I suppose you know best," replied Tess with calm</p>

<p>abandonment.</p>

<p>And to please her parent the girl put herself quite in Joan's hands,</p>

<p>saying serenely--"Do what you like with me, mother."</p>

<p>Mrs Durbeyfield was only too delighted at this tractability.</p>

<p>First she fetched a great basin, and washed Tess's hair with such</p>

<p>thoroughness that when dried and brushed it looked twice as much as</p>

<p>at other times.  She tied it with a broader pink ribbon than usual.</p>

<p>Then she put upon her the white frock that Tess had worn at the</p>

<p>club-walking, the airy fulness of which, supplementing her enlarged</p>

<p>_coiffure_, imparted to her developing figure an amplitude which</p>

<p>belied her age, and might cause her to be estimated as a woman when</p>

<p>she was not much more than a child.</p>

<p>"I declare there's a hole in my stocking-heel!" said Tess.</p>

<p>"Never mind holes in your stockings--they don't speak!  When I was a</p>

<p>maid, so long as I had a pretty bonnet the devil might ha' found me</p>

<p>in heels."</p>

<p>Her mother's pride in the girl's appearance led her to step back,</p>

<p>like a painter from his easel, and survey her work as a whole.</p>

<p>"You must zee yourself!" she cried.  "It is much better than you was</p>

<p>t'other day."</p>

<p>As the looking-glass was only large enough to reflect a very small</p>

<p>portion of Tess's person at one time, Mrs Durbeyfield hung a black</p>

<p>cloak outside the casement, and so made a large reflector of the</p>

<p>panes, as it is the wont of bedecking cottagers to do.  After this</p>

<p>she went downstairs to her husband, who was sitting in the lower</p>

<p>room.</p>

<p>"I'll tell 'ee what 'tis, Durbeyfield," said she exultingly; "he'll</p>

<p>never have the heart not to love her.  But whatever you do, don't zay</p>

<p>too much to Tess of his fancy for her, and this chance she has got.</p>

<p>She is such an odd maid that it mid zet her against him, or against</p>

<p>going there, even now.  If all goes well, I shall certainly be for</p>

<p>making some return to pa'son at Stagfoot Lane for telling us--dear,</p>

<p>good man!"</p>

<p>However, as the moment for the girl's setting out drew nigh, when the</p>

<p>first excitement of the dressing had passed off, a slight misgiving</p>

<p>found place in Joan Durbeyfield's mind.  It prompted the matron to</p>

<p>say that she would walk a little way--as far as to the point where</p>

<p>the acclivity from the valley began its first steep ascent to</p>

<p>the outer world.  At the top Tess was going to be met with the</p>

<p>spring-cart sent by the Stoke-d'Urbervilles, and her box had already</p>

<p>been wheeled ahead towards this summit by a lad with trucks, to be in</p>

<p>readiness.</p>

<p>Seeing their mother put on her bonnet, the younger children clamoured</p>

<p>to go with her.</p>

<p>"I do want to walk a little-ways wi' Sissy, now she's going to marry</p>

<p>our gentleman-cousin, and wear fine cloze!"</p>

<p>"Now," said Tess, flushing and turning quickly, "I'll hear no more o'</p>

<p>that!  Mother, how could you ever put such stuff into their heads?"</p>

<p>"Going to work, my dears, for our rich relation, and help get enough</p>

<p>money for a new horse," said Mrs Durbeyfield pacifically.</p>

<p>"Goodbye, father," said Tess, with a lumpy throat.</p>

<p>"Goodbye, my maid," said Sir John, raising his head from his breast</p>

<p>as he suspended his nap, induced by a slight excess this morning in</p>

<p>honour of the occasion.  "Well, I hope my young friend will like such</p>

<p>a comely sample of his own blood.  And tell'n, Tess, that being sunk,</p>

<p>quite, from our former grandeur, I'll sell him the title--yes, sell</p>

<p>it--and at no onreasonable figure."</p>

<p>"Not for less than a thousand pound!" cried Lady Durbeyfield.</p>

<p>"Tell'n--I'll take a thousand pound.  Well, I'll take less, when</p>

<p>I come to think o't.  He'll adorn it better than a poor lammicken</p>

<p>feller like myself can.  Tell'n he shall hae it for a hundred.  But</p>

<p>I won't stand upon trifles--tell'n he shall hae it for fifty--for</p>

<p>twenty pound!  Yes, twenty pound--that's the lowest.  Dammy, family</p>

<p>honour is family honour, and I won't take a penny less!"</p>

<p>Tess's eyes were too full and her voice too choked to utter the</p>

<p>sentiments that were in her.  She turned quickly, and went out.</p>

<p>So the girls and their mother all walked together, a child on each</p>

<p>side of Tess, holding her hand and looking at her meditatively from</p>

<p>time to time, as at one who was about to do great things; her mother</p>

<p>just behind with the smallest; the group forming a picture of honest</p>

<p>beauty flanked by innocence, and backed by simple-souled vanity.</p>

<p>They followed the way till they reached the beginning of the ascent,</p>

<p>on the crest of which the vehicle from Trantridge was to receive her,</p>

<p>this limit having been fixed to save the horse the labour of the last</p>

<p>slope.  Far away behind the first hills the cliff-like dwellings</p>

<p>of Shaston broke the line of the ridge. Nobody was visible in the</p>

<p>elevated road which skirted the ascent save the lad whom they had</p>

<p>sent on before them, sitting on the handle of the barrow that</p>

<p>contained all Tess's worldly possessions.</p>

<p>"Bide here a bit, and the cart will soon come, no doubt," said Mrs</p>

<p>Durbeyfield.  "Yes, I see it yonder!"</p>

<p>It had come--appearing suddenly from behind the forehead of the</p>

<p>nearest upland, and stopping beside the boy with the barrow.  Her</p>

<p>mother and the children thereupon decided to go no farther, and</p>

<p>bidding them a hasty goodbye, Tess bent her steps up the hill.</p>

<p>They saw her white shape draw near to the spring-cart, on which her</p>

<p>box was already placed.  But before she had quite reached it another</p>

<p>vehicle shot out from a clump of trees on the summit, came round the</p>

<p>bend of the road there, passed the luggage-cart, and halted beside</p>

<p>Tess, who looked up as if in great surprise.</p>

<p>Her mother perceived, for the first time, that the second vehicle was</p>

<p>not a humble conveyance like the first, but a spick-and-span gig or</p>

<p>dog-cart, highly varnished and equipped.  The driver was a young man</p>

<p>of three- or four-and-twenty, with a cigar between his teeth; wearing</p>

<p>a dandy cap, drab jacket, breeches of the same hue, white neckcloth,</p>

<p>stick-up collar, and brown driving-gloves--in short, he was the</p>

<p>handsome, horsey young buck who had visited Joan a week or two before</p>

<p>to get her answer about Tess.</p>

<p>Mrs Durbeyfield clapped her hands like a child.  Then she looked</p>

<p>down, then stared again.  Could she be deceived as to the meaning of</p>

<p>this?</p>

<p>"Is dat the gentleman-kinsman who'll make Sissy a lady?" asked the</p>

<p>youngest child.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the muslined form of Tess could be seen standing still,</p>

<p>undecided, beside this turn-out, whose owner was talking to her.</p>

<p>Her seeming indecision was, in fact, more than indecision: it was</p>

<p>misgiving.  She would have preferred the humble cart.  The young</p>

<p>man dismounted, and appeared to urge her to ascend.  She turned her</p>

<p>face down the hill to her relatives, and regarded the little group.</p>

<p>Something seemed to quicken her to a determination; possibly the</p>

<p>thought that she had killed Prince.  She suddenly stepped up; he</p>

<p>mounted beside her, and immediately whipped on the horse.  In a</p>

<p>moment they had passed the slow cart with the box, and disappeared</p>

<p>behind the shoulder of the hill.</p>

<p>Directly Tess was out of sight, and the interest of the matter as a</p>

<p>drama was at an end, the little ones' eyes filled with tears.  The</p>

<p>youngest child said, "I wish poor, poor Tess wasn't gone away to be a</p>

<p>lady!" and, lowering the corners of his lips, burst out crying.  The</p>

<p>new point of view was infectious, and the next child did likewise,</p>

<p>and then the next, till the whole three of them wailed loud.</p>

<p>There were tears also in Joan Durbeyfield's eyes as she turned to</p>

<p>go home.  But by the time she had got back to the village she was</p>

<p>passively trusting to the favour of accident.  However, in bed that</p>

<p>night she sighed, and her husband asked her what was the matter.</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know exactly," she said.  "I was thinking that perhaps</p>

<p>it would ha' been better if Tess had not gone."</p>

<p>"Oughtn't ye to have thought of that before?"</p>

<p>"Well, 'tis a chance for the maid--Still, if 'twere the doing again,</p>

<p>I wouldn't let her go till I had found out whether the gentleman</p>

<p>is really a good-hearted young man and choice over her as his</p>

<p>kinswoman."</p>

<p>"Yes, you ought, perhaps, to ha' done that," snored Sir John.</p>

<p>Joan Durbeyfield always managed to find consolation somewhere: "Well,</p>

<p>as one of the genuine stock, she ought to make her way with 'en, if</p>

<p>she plays her trump card aright.  And if he don't marry her afore he</p>

<p>will after.  For that he's all afire wi' love for her any eye can</p>

<p>see."</p>

<p>"What's her trump card?  Her d'Urberville blood, you mean?"</p>

<p>"No, stupid; her face--as 'twas mine."</p>

<p>VIII</p>

<p>Having mounted beside her, Alec d'Urberville drove rapidly along</p>

<p>the crest of the first hill, chatting compliments to Tess as they</p>

<p>went, the cart with her box being left far behind.  Rising still, an</p>

<p>immense landscape stretched around them on every side; behind, the</p>

<p>green valley of her birth, before, a gray country of which she knew</p>

<p>nothing except from her first brief visit to Trantridge.  Thus they</p>

<p>reached the verge of an incline down which the road stretched in a</p>

<p>long straight descent of nearly a mile.</p>

<p>Ever since the accident with her father's horse Tess Durbeyfield,</p>

<p>courageous as she naturally was, had been exceedingly timid on</p>

<p>wheels; the least irregularity of motion startled her.  She began to</p>

<p>get uneasy at a certain recklessness in her conductor's driving.</p>

<p>"You will go down slow, sir, I suppose?" she said with attempted</p>

<p>unconcern.</p>

<p>D'Urberville looked round upon her, nipped his cigar with the tips of</p>

<p>his large white centre-teeth, and allowed his lips to smile slowly of</p>

<p>themselves.</p>

<p>"Why, Tess," he answered, after another whiff or two, "it isn't a</p>

<p>brave bouncing girl like you who asks that?  Why, I always go down at</p>

<p>full gallop.  There's nothing like it for raising your spirits."</p>

<p>"But perhaps you need not now?"</p>

<p>"Ah," he said, shaking his head, "there are two to be reckoned with.</p>

<p>It is not me alone.  Tib has to be considered, and she has a very</p>

<p>queer temper."</p>

<p>"Who?"</p>

<p>"Why, this mare.  I fancy she looked round at me in a very grim way</p>

<p>just then.  Didn't you notice it?"</p>

<p>"Don't try to frighten me, sir," said Tess stiffly.</p>

<p>"Well, I don't.  If any living man can manage this horse I can: I</p>

<p>won't say any living man can do it--but if such has the power, I am</p>

<p>he."</p>

<p>"Why do you have such a horse?"</p>

<p>"Ah, well may you ask it!  It was my fate, I suppose. Tib has killed</p>

<p>one chap; and just after I bought her she nearly killed me.  And</p>

<p>then, take my word for it, I nearly killed her.  But she's touchy</p>

<p>still, very touchy; and one's life is hardly safe behind her</p>

<p>sometimes."</p>

<p>They were just beginning to descend; and it was evident that the</p>

<p>horse, whether of her own will or of his (the latter being the more</p>

<p>likely), knew so well the reckless performance expected of her that</p>

<p>she hardly required a hint from behind.</p>

<p>Down, down, they sped, the wheels humming like a top, the dog-cart</p>

<p>rocking right and left, its axis acquiring a slightly oblique set</p>

<p>in relation to the line of progress; the figure of the horse rising</p>

<p>and falling in undulations before them.  Sometimes a wheel was off</p>

<p>the ground, it seemed, for many yards; sometimes a stone was sent</p>

<p>spinning over the hedge, and flinty sparks from the horse's hoofs</p>

<p>outshone the daylight.  The aspect of the straight road enlarged with</p>

<p>their advance, the two banks dividing like a splitting stick; one</p>

<p>rushing past at each shoulder.</p>

<p>The wind blew through Tess's white muslin to her very skin, and her</p>

<p>washed hair flew out behind.  She was determined to show no open</p>

<p>fear, but she clutched d'Urberville's rein-arm.</p>

<p>"Don't touch my arm!  We shall be thrown out if you do!  Hold on</p>

<p>round my waist!"</p>

<p>She grasped his waist, and so they reached the bottom.</p>

<p>"Safe, thank God, in spite of your fooling!" said she, her face on</p>

<p>fire.</p>

<p>"Tess--fie! that's temper!" said d'Urberville.</p>

<p>"'Tis truth."</p>

<p>"Well, you need not let go your hold of me so thanklessly the moment</p>

<p>you feel yourself our of danger."</p>

<p>She had not considered what she had been doing; whether he were man</p>

<p>or woman, stick or stone, in her involuntary hold on him.  Recovering</p>

<p>her reserve, she sat without replying, and thus they reached the</p>

<p>summit of another declivity.</p>

<p>"Now then, again!" said d'Urberville.</p>

<p>"No, no!" said Tess.  "Show more sense, do, please."</p>

<p>"But when people find themselves on one of the highest points in the</p>

<p>county, they must get down again," he retorted.</p>

<p>He loosened rein, and away they went a second time.  D'Urberville</p>

<p>turned his face to her as they rocked, and said, in playful raillery:</p>

<p>"Now then, put your arms round my waist again, as you did before, my</p>

<p>Beauty."</p>

<p>"Never!" said Tess independently, holding on as well as she could</p>

<p>without touching him.</p>

<p>"Let me put one little kiss on those holmberry lips, Tess, or even on</p>

<p>that warmed cheek, and I'll stop--on my honour, I will!"</p>

<p>Tess, surprised beyond measure, slid farther back still on her seat,</p>

<p>at which he urged the horse anew, and rocked her the more.</p>

<p>"Will nothing else do?" she cried at length, in desperation, her</p>

<p>large eyes staring at him like those of a wild animal.  This dressing</p>

<p>her up so prettily by her mother had apparently been to lamentable</p>

<p>purpose.</p>

<p>"Nothing, dear Tess," he replied.</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know--very well; I don't mind!" she panted miserably.</p>

<p>He drew rein, and as they slowed he was on the point of imprinting</p>

<p>the desired salute, when, as if hardly yet aware of her own modesty,</p>

<p>she dodged aside.  His arms being occupied with the reins there was</p>

<p>left him no power to prevent her manoeuvre.</p>

<p>"Now, damn it--I'll break both our necks!" swore her capriciously</p>

<p>passionate companion.  "So you can go from your word like that, you</p>

<p>young witch, can you?"</p>

<p>"Very well," said Tess, "I'll not move since you be so determined!</p>

<p>But I--thought you would be kind to me, and protect me, as my</p>

<p>kinsman!"</p>

<p>"Kinsman be hanged!  Now!"</p>

<p>"But I don't want anybody to kiss me, sir!" she implored, a big</p>

<p>tear beginning to roll down her face, and the corners of her mouth</p>

<p>trembling in her attempts not to cry.  "And I wouldn't ha' come if</p>

<p>I had known!"</p>

<p>He was inexorable, and she sat still, and d'Urberville gave her the</p>

<p>kiss of mastery.  No sooner had he done so than she flushed with</p>

<p>shame, took out her handkerchief, and wiped the spot on her cheek</p>

<p>that had been touched by his lips.  His ardour was nettled at the</p>

<p>sight, for the act on her part had been unconsciously done.</p>

<p>"You are mighty sensitive for a cottage girl!" said the young man.</p>

<p>Tess made no reply to this remark, of which, indeed, she did not</p>

<p>quite comprehend the drift, unheeding the snub she had administered</p>

<p>by her instinctive rub upon her cheek.  She had, in fact, undone the</p>

<p>kiss, as far as such a thing was physically possible.  With a dim</p>

<p>sense that he was vexed she looked steadily ahead as they trotted on</p>

<p>near Melbury Down and Wingreen, till she saw, to her consternation,</p>

<p>that there was yet another descent to be undergone.</p>

<p>"You shall be made sorry for that!" he resumed, his injured tone</p>

<p>still remaining, as he flourished the whip anew.  "Unless, that is,</p>

<p>you agree willingly to let me do it again, and no handkerchief."</p>

<p>She sighed. "Very well, sir!" she said.  "Oh--let me get my hat!"</p>

<p>At the moment of speaking her hat had blown off into the road, their</p>

<p>present speed on the upland being by no means slow.  D'Urberville</p>

<p>pulled up, and said he would get it for her, but Tess was down on the</p>

<p>other side.</p>

<p>She turned back and picked up the article.</p>

<p>"You look prettier with it off, upon my soul, if that's possible," he</p>

<p>said, contemplating her over the back of the vehicle.  "Now then, up</p>

<p>again!  What's the matter?"</p>

<p>The hat was in place and tied, but Tess had not stepped forward.</p>

<p>"No, sir," she said, revealing the red and ivory of her mouth as her</p>

<p>eye lit in defiant triumph; "not again, if I know it!"</p>

<p>"What--you won't get up beside me?"</p>

<p>"No; I shall walk."</p>

<p>"'Tis five or six miles yet to Trantridge."</p>

<p>"I don't care if 'tis dozens.  Besides, the cart is behind."</p>

<p>"You artful hussy!  Now, tell me--didn't you make that hat blow off</p>

<p>on purpose?  I'll swear you did!"</p>

<p>Her strategic silence confirmed his suspicion.</p>

<p>Then d'Urberville cursed and swore at her, and called her everything</p>

<p>he could think of for the trick.  Turning the horse suddenly he tried</p>

<p>to drive back upon her, and so hem her in between the gig and the</p>

<p>hedge.  But he could not do this short of injuring her.</p>

<p>"You ought to be ashamed of yourself for using such wicked words!"</p>

<p>cried Tess with spirit, from the top of the hedge into which she had</p>

<p>scrambled.  "I don't like 'ee at all!  I hate and detest you!  I'll</p>

<p>go back to mother, I will!"</p>

<p>D'Urberville's bad temper cleared up at sight of hers; and he laughed</p>

<p>heartily.</p>

<p>"Well, I like you all the better," he said.  "Come, let there be</p>

<p>peace.  I'll never do it any more against your will.  My life upon</p>

<p>it now!"</p>

<p>Still Tess could not be induced to remount.  She did not, however,</p>

<p>object to his keeping his gig alongside her; and in this manner, at</p>

<p>a slow pace, they advanced towards the village of Trantridge.  From</p>

<p>time to time d'Urberville exhibited a sort of fierce distress at</p>

<p>the sight of the tramping he had driven her to undertake by his</p>

<p>misdemeanour.  She might in truth have safely trusted him now; but he</p>

<p>had forfeited her confidence for the time, and she kept on the ground</p>

<p>progressing thoughtfully, as if wondering whether it would be wiser</p>

<p>to return home.  Her resolve, however, had been taken, and it seemed</p>

<p>vacillating even to childishness to abandon it now, unless for graver</p>

<p>reasons.  How could she face her parents, get back her box, and</p>

<p>disconcert the whole scheme for the rehabilitation of her family on</p>

<p>such sentimental grounds?</p>

<p>A few minutes later the chimneys of The Slopes appeared in view, and</p>

<p>in a snug nook to the right the poultry-farm and cottage of Tess'</p>

<p>destination.</p>

<p>IX</p>

<p>The community of fowls to which Tess had been appointed as</p>

<p>supervisor, purveyor, nurse, surgeon, and friend made its</p>

<p>headquarters in an old thatched cottage standing in an enclosure that</p>

<p>had once been a garden, but was now a trampled and sanded square.</p>

<p>The house was overrun with ivy, its chimney being enlarged by the</p>

<p>boughs of the parasite to the aspect of a ruined tower.  The lower</p>

<p>rooms were entirely given over to the birds, who walked about them</p>

<p>with a proprietary air, as though the place had been built by</p>

<p>themselves, and not by certain dusty copyholders who now lay east</p>

<p>and west in the churchyard.  The descendants of these bygone owners</p>

<p>felt it almost as a slight to their family when the house which had</p>

<p>so much of their affection, had cost so much of their forefathers'</p>

<p>money, and had been in their possession for several generations</p>

<p>before the d'Urbervilles came and built here, was indifferently</p>

<p>turned into a fowl-house by Mrs Stoke-d'Urberville as soon as the</p>

<p>property fell into hand according to law.  "'Twas good enough for</p>

<p>Christians in grandfather's time," they said.</p>

<p>The rooms wherein dozens of infants had wailed at their nursing now</p>

<p>resounded with the tapping of nascent chicks.  Distracted hens in</p>

<p>coops occupied spots where formerly stood chairs supporting sedate</p>

<p>agriculturists.  The chimney-corner and once-blazing hearth was now</p>

<p>filled with inverted beehives, in which the hens laid their eggs;</p>

<p>while out of doors the plots that each succeeding householder had</p>

<p>carefully shaped with his spade were torn by the cocks in wildest</p>

<p>fashion.</p>

<p>The garden in which the cottage stood was surrounded by a wall, and</p>

<p>could only be entered through a door.</p>

<p>When Tess had occupied herself about an hour the next morning in</p>

<p>altering and improving the arrangements, according to her skilled</p>

<p>ideas as the daughter of a professed poulterer, the door in the wall</p>

<p>opened and a servant in white cap and apron entered.  She had come</p>

<p>from the manor-house.</p>

<p>"Mrs d'Urberville wants the fowls as usual," she said; but perceiving</p>

<p>that Tess did not quite understand, she explained, "Mis'ess is a old</p>

<p>lady, and blind."</p>

<p>"Blind!" said Tess.</p>

<p>Almost before her misgiving at the news could find time to shape</p>

<p>itself she took, under her companion's direction, two of the</p>

<p>most beautiful of the Hamburghs in her arms, and followed the</p>

<p>maid-servant, who had likewise taken two, to the adjacent mansion,</p>

<p>which, though ornate and imposing, showed traces everywhere on this</p>

<p>side that some occupant of its chambers could bend to the love of</p>

<p>dumb creatures--feathers floating within view of the front, and</p>

<p>hen-coops standing on the grass.</p>

<p>In a sitting-room on the ground-floor, ensconced in an armchair with</p>

<p>her back to the light, was the owner and mistress of the estate, a</p>

<p>white-haired woman of not more than sixty, or even less, wearing a</p>

<p>large cap.  She had the mobile face frequent in those whose sight</p>

<p>has decayed by stages, has been laboriously striven after, and</p>

<p>reluctantly let go, rather than the stagnant mien apparent in persons</p>

<p>long sightless or born blind.  Tess walked up to this lady with her</p>

<p>feathered charges--one sitting on each arm.</p>

<p>"Ah, you are the young woman come to look after my birds?" said Mrs</p>

<p>d'Urberville, recognizing a new footstep.  "I hope you will be kind</p>

<p>to them.  My bailiff tells me you are quite the proper person.</p>

<p>Well, where are they?  Ah, this is Strut!  But he is hardly so</p>

<p>lively to-day, is he?  He is alarmed at being handled by a stranger,</p>

<p>I suppose. And Phena too--yes, they are a little frightened--aren't</p>

<p>you, dears? But they will soon get used to you."</p>

<p>While the old lady had been speaking Tess and the other maid, in</p>

<p>obedience to her gestures, had placed the fowls severally in her lap,</p>

<p>and she had felt them over from head to tail, examining their beaks,</p>

<p>their combs, the manes of the cocks, their wings, and their claws.</p>

<p>Her touch enabled her to recognize them in a moment, and to discover</p>

<p>if a single feather were crippled or draggled.  She handled their</p>

<p>crops, and knew what they had eaten, and if too little or too much;</p>

<p>her face enacting a vivid pantomime of the criticisms passing in her</p>

<p>mind.</p>

<p>The birds that the two girls had brought in were duly returned to the</p>

<p>yard, and the process was repeated till all the pet cocks and hens</p>

<p>had been submitted to the old woman--Hamburghs, Bantams, Cochins,</p>

<p>Brahmas, Dorkings, and such other sorts as were in fashion just</p>

<p>then--her perception of each visitor being seldom at fault as she</p>

<p>received the bird upon her knees.</p>

<p>It reminded Tess of a Confirmation, in which Mrs d'Urberville was the</p>

<p>bishop, the fowls the young people presented, and herself and the</p>

<p>maid-servant the parson and curate of the parish bringing them up.</p>

<p>At the end of the ceremony Mrs d'Urberville abruptly asked Tess,</p>

<p>wrinkling and twitching her face into undulations, "Can you whistle?"</p>

<p>"Whistle, Ma'am?"</p>

<p>"Yes, whistle tunes."</p>

<p>Tess could whistle like most other country-girls, though the</p>

<p>accomplishment was one which she did not care to profess in genteel</p>

<p>company.  However, she blandly admitted that such was the fact.</p>

<p>"Then you will have to practise it every day.  I had a lad who did it</p>

<p>very well, but he has left.  I want you to whistle to my bullfinches;</p>

<p>as I cannot see them, I like to hear them, and we teach 'em airs</p>

<p>that way.  Tell her where the cages are, Elizabeth.  You must begin</p>

<p>to-morrow, or they will go back in their piping. They have been</p>

<p>neglected these several days."</p>

<p>"Mr d'Urberville whistled to 'em this morning, ma'am," said</p>

<p>Elizabeth.</p>

<p>"He!  Pooh!"</p>

<p>The old lady's face creased into furrows of repugnance, and she made</p>

<p>no further reply.</p>

<p>Thus the reception of Tess by her fancied kinswoman terminated, and</p>

<p>the birds were taken back to their quarters.  The girl's surprise at</p>

<p>Mrs d'Urberville's manner was not great; for since seeing the size of</p>

<p>the house she had expected no more.  But she was far from being aware</p>

<p>that the old lady had never heard a word of the so-called kinship.</p>

<p>She gathered that no great affection flowed between the blind woman</p>

<p>and her son.  But in that, too, she was mistaken.  Mrs d'Urberville</p>

<p>was not the first mother compelled to love her offspring resentfully,</p>

<p>and to be bitterly fond.</p>

<p>In spite of the unpleasant initiation of the day before, Tess</p>

<p>inclined to the freedom and novelty of her new position in the</p>

<p>morning when the sun shone, now that she was once installed there;</p>

<p>and she was curious to test her powers in the unexpected direction</p>

<p>asked of her, so as to ascertain her chance of retaining her post.</p>

<p>As soon as she was alone within the walled garden she sat herself</p>

<p>down on a coop, and seriously screwed up her mouth for the</p>

<p>long-neglected practice.  She found her former ability to have</p>

<p>degenerated to the production of a hollow rush of wind through the</p>

<p>lips, and no clear note at all.</p>

<p>She remained fruitlessly blowing and blowing, wondering how she</p>

<p>could have so grown out of the art which had come by nature, till</p>

<p>she became aware of a movement among the ivy-boughs which cloaked</p>

<p>the garden-wall no less then the cottage.  Looking that way she</p>

<p>beheld a form springing from the coping to the plot.  It was Alec</p>

<p>d'Urberville, whom she had not set eyes on since he had conducted</p>

<p>her the day before to the door of the gardener's cottage where she</p>

<p>had lodgings.</p>

<p>"Upon my honour!" cried he, "there was never before such a beautiful</p>

<p>thing in Nature or Art as you look, 'Cousin' Tess ('Cousin' had a</p>

<p>faint ring of mockery).  I have been watching you from over the</p>

<p>wall--sitting like IM-patience on a monument, and pouting up that</p>

<p>pretty red mouth to whistling shape, and whooing and whooing, and</p>

<p>privately swearing, and never being able to produce a note.  Why,</p>

<p>you are quite cross because you can't do it."</p>

<p>"I may be cross, but I didn't swear."</p>

<p>"Ah!  I understand why you are trying--those bullies!  My mother</p>

<p>wants you to carry on their musical education.  How selfish of her!</p>

<p>As if attending to these curst cocks and hens here were not enough</p>

<p>work for any girl.  I would flatly refuse, if I were you."</p>

<p>"But she wants me particularly to do it, and to be ready by to-morrow</p>

<p>morning."</p>

<p>"Does she?  Well then--I'll give you a lesson or two."</p>

<p>"Oh no, you won't!" said Tess, withdrawing towards the door.</p>

<p>"Nonsense; I don't want to touch you.  See--I'll stand on this side</p>

<p>of the wire-netting, and you can keep on the other; so you may feel</p>

<p>quite safe.  Now, look here; you screw up your lips too harshly.</p>

<p>There 'tis--so."</p>

<p>He suited the action to the word, and whistled a line of "Take, O</p>

<p>take those lips away."  But the allusion was lost upon Tess.</p>

<p>"Now try," said d'Urberville.</p>

<p>She attempted to look reserved; her face put on a sculptural</p>

<p>severity.  But he persisted in his demand, and at last, to get rid of</p>

<p>him, she did put up her lips as directed for producing a clear note;</p>

<p>laughing distressfully, however, and then blushing with vexation that</p>

<p>she had laughed.</p>

<p>He encouraged her with "Try again!"</p>

<p>Tess was quite serious, painfully serious by this time; and she</p>

<p>tried--ultimately and unexpectedly emitting a real round sound.</p>

<p>The momentary pleasure of success got the better of her; her eyes</p>

<p>enlarged, and she involuntarily smiled in his face.</p>

<p>"That's it!  Now I have started you--you'll go on beautifully.</p>

<p>There--I said I would not come near you; and, in spite of such</p>

<p>temptation as never before fell to mortal man, I'll keep my</p>

<p>word...  Tess, do you think my mother a queer old soul?"</p>

<p>"I don't know much of her yet, sir."</p>

<p>"You'll find her so; she must be, to make you learn to whistle to her</p>

<p>bullfinches.  I am rather out of her books just now, but you will be</p>

<p>quite in favour if you treat her live-stock well.  Good morning.  If</p>

<p>you meet with any difficulties and want help here, don't go to the</p>

<p>bailiff, come to me."</p>

<p>It was in the economy of this _rйgime_ that Tess Durbeyfield had</p>

<p>undertaken to fill a place.  Her first day's experiences were fairly</p>

<p>typical of those which followed through many succeeding days.  A</p>

<p>familiarity with Alec d'Urberville's presence--which that young man</p>

<p>carefully cultivated in her by playful dialogue, and by jestingly</p>

<p>calling her his cousin when they were alone--removed much of her</p>

<p>original shyness of him, without, however, implanting any feeling</p>

<p>which could engender shyness of a new and tenderer kind.  But she was</p>

<p>more pliable under his hands than a mere companionship would have</p>

<p>made her, owing to her unavoidable dependence upon his mother, and,</p>

<p>through that lady's comparative helplessness, upon him.</p>

<p>She soon found that whistling to the bullfinches in Mrs</p>

<p>d'Urberville's room was no such onerous business when she had</p>

<p>regained the art, for she had caught from her musical mother numerous</p>

<p>airs that suited those songsters admirably.  A far more satisfactory</p>

<p>time than when she practised in the garden was this whistling by the</p>

<p>cages each morning.  Unrestrained by the young man's presence she</p>

<p>threw up her mouth, put her lips near the bars, and piped away in</p>

<p>easeful grace to the attentive listeners.</p>

<p>Mrs d'Urberville slept in a large four-post bedstead hung with heavy</p>

<p>damask curtains, and the bullfinches occupied the same apartment,</p>

<p>where they flitted about freely at certain hours, and made little</p>

<p>white spots on the furniture and upholstery.  Once while Tess was at</p>

<p>the window where the cages were ranged, giving her lesson as usual,</p>

<p>she thought she heard a rustling behind the bed.  The old lady was</p>

<p>not present, and turning round the girl had an impression that</p>

<p>the toes of a pair of boots were visible below the fringe of the</p>

<p>curtains.  Thereupon her whistling became so disjointed that the</p>

<p>listener, if such there were, must have discovered her suspicion of</p>

<p>his presence.  She searched the curtains every morning after that,</p>

<p>but never found anybody within them.  Alec d'Urberville had evidently</p>

<p>thought better of his freak to terrify her by an ambush of that kind.</p>

<p>X</p>

<p>Every village has its idiosyncrasy, its constitution, often its own</p>

<p>code of morality.  The levity of some of the younger women in and</p>

<p>about Trantridge was marked, and was perhaps symptomatic of the</p>

<p>choice spirit who ruled The Slopes in that vicinity.  The place had</p>

<p>also a more abiding defect; it drank hard.  The staple conversation</p>

<p>on the farms around was on the uselessness of saving money; and</p>

<p>smock-frocked arithmeticians, leaning on their ploughs or hoes, would</p>

<p>enter into calculations of great nicety to prove that parish relief</p>

<p>was a fuller provision for a man in his old age than any which could</p>

<p>result from savings out of their wages during a whole lifetime.</p>

<p>The chief pleasure of these philosophers lay in going every Saturday</p>

<p>night, when work was done, to Chaseborough, a decayed market-town two</p>

<p>or three miles distant; and, returning in the small hours of the next</p>

<p>morning, to spend Sunday in sleeping off the dyspeptic effects of the</p>

<p>curious compounds sold to them as beer by the monopolizers of the</p>

<p>once-independent inns.</p>

<p>For a long time Tess did not join in the weekly pilgrimages.  But</p>

<p>under pressure from matrons not much older than herself--for a</p>

<p>field-man's wages being as high at twenty-one as at forty, marriage</p>

<p>was early here--Tess at length consented to go.  Her first experience</p>

<p>of the journey afforded her more enjoyment than she had expected,</p>

<p>the hilariousness of the others being quite contagious after her</p>

<p>monotonous attention to the poultry-farm all the week. She went again</p>

<p>and again.  Being graceful and interesting, standing moreover on the</p>

<p>momentary threshold of womanhood, her appearance drew down upon her</p>

<p>some sly regards from loungers in the streets of Chaseborough; hence,</p>

<p>though sometimes her journey to the town was made independently, she</p>

<p>always searched for her fellows at nightfall, to have the protection</p>

<p>of their companionship homeward.</p>

<p>This had gone on for a month or two when there came a Saturday in</p>

<p>September, on which a fair and a market coincided; and the pilgrims</p>

<p>from Trantridge sought double delights at the inns on that account.</p>

<p>Tess's occupations made her late in setting out, so that her comrades</p>

<p>reached the town long before her.  It was a fine September evening,</p>

<p>just before sunset, when yellow lights struggle with blue shades in</p>

<p>hairlike lines, and the atmosphere itself forms a prospect without</p>

<p>aid from more solid objects, except the innumerable winged insects</p>

<p>that dance in it.  Through this low-lit mistiness Tess walked</p>

<p>leisurely along.</p>

<p>She did not discover the coincidence of the market with the fair till</p>

<p>she had reached the place, by which time it was close upon dusk.  Her</p>

<p>limited marketing was soon completed; and then as usual she began to</p>

<p>look about for some of the Trantridge cottagers.</p>

<p>At first she could not find them, and she was informed that most of</p>

<p>them had gone to what they called a private little jig at the house</p>

<p>of a hay-trusser and peat-dealer who had transactions with their</p>

<p>farm.  He lived in an out-of-the-way nook of the townlet, and in</p>

<p>trying to find her course thither her eyes fell upon Mr d'Urberville</p>

<p>standing at a street corner.</p>

<p>"What--my Beauty?  You here so late?" he said.</p>

<p>She told him that she was simply waiting for company homeward.</p>

<p>"I'll see you again," said he over her shoulder as she went on down</p>

<p>the back lane.</p>

<p>Approaching the hay-trussers, she could hear the fiddled notes of</p>

<p>a reel proceeding from some building in the rear; but no sound of</p>

<p>dancing was audible--an exceptional state of things for these parts,</p>

<p>where as a rule the stamping drowned the music.  The front door being</p>

<p>open she could see straight through the house into the garden at the</p>

<p>back as far as the shades of night would allow; and nobody appearing</p>

<p>to her knock, she traversed the dwelling and went up the path to the</p>

<p>outhouse whence the sound had attracted her.</p>

<p>It was a windowless erection used for storage, and from the open door</p>

<p>there floated into the obscurity a mist of yellow radiance, which at</p>

<p>first Tess thought to be illuminated smoke.  But on drawing nearer</p>

<p>she perceived that it was a cloud of dust, lit by candles within the</p>

<p>outhouse, whose beams upon the haze carried forward the outline of</p>

<p>the doorway into the wide night of the garden.</p>

<p>When she came close and looked in she beheld indistinct forms</p>

<p>racing up and down to the figure of the dance, the silence of their</p>

<p>footfalls arising from their being overshoe in "scroff"--that is</p>

<p>to say, the powdery residuum from the storage of peat and other</p>

<p>products, the stirring of which by their turbulent feet created the</p>

<p>nebulosity that involved the scene.  Through this floating, fusty</p>

<p>_debris_ of peat and hay, mixed with the perspirations and warmth of</p>

<p>the dancers, and forming together a sort of vegeto-human pollen, the</p>

<p>muted fiddles feebly pushed their notes, in marked contrast to the</p>

<p>spirit with which the measure was trodden out.  They coughed as</p>

<p>they danced, and laughed as they coughed.  Of the rushing couples</p>

<p>there could barely be discerned more than the high lights--the</p>

<p>indistinctness shaping them to satyrs clasping nymphs--a multiplicity</p>

<p>of Pans whirling a multiplicity of Syrinxes; Lotis attempting to</p>

<p>elude Priapus, and always failing.</p>

<p>At intervals a couple would approach the doorway for air, and</p>

<p>the haze no longer veiling their features, the demigods resolved</p>

<p>themselves into the homely personalities of her own next-door</p>

<p>neighbours.  Could Trantridge in two or three short hours have</p>

<p>metamorphosed itself thus madly!</p>

<p>Some Sileni of the throng sat on benches and hay-trusses by the wall;</p>

<p>and one of them recognized her.</p>

<p>"The maids don't think it respectable to dance at The Flower-de-Luce,"</p>

<p>he explained.  "They don't like to let everybody see which be their</p>

<p>fancy-men.  Besides, the house sometimes shuts up just when their</p>

<p>jints begin to get greased.  So we come here and send out for</p>

<p>liquor."</p>

<p>"But when be any of you going home?" asked Tess with some anxiety.</p>

<p>"Now--a'most directly.  This is all but the last jig."</p>

<p>She waited.  The reel drew to a close, and some of the party were in</p>

<p>the mind of starting.  But others would not, and another dance was</p>

<p>formed.  This surely would end it, thought Tess.  But it merged in</p>

<p>yet another.  She became restless and uneasy; yet, having waited so</p>

<p>long, it was necessary to wait longer; on account of the fair the</p>

<p>roads were dotted with roving characters of possibly ill intent; and,</p>

<p>though not fearful of measurable dangers, she feared the unknown.</p>

<p>Had she been near Marlott she would have had less dread.</p>

<p>"Don't ye be nervous, my dear good soul," expostulated, between his</p>

<p>coughs, a young man with a wet face and his straw hat so far back</p>

<p>upon his head that the brim encircled it like the nimbus of a saint.</p>

<p>"What's yer hurry?  To-morrow is Sunday, thank God, and we can sleep</p>

<p>it off in church-time.  Now, have a turn with me?"</p>

<p>She did not abhor dancing, but she was not going to dance here.  The</p>

<p>movement grew more passionate: the fiddlers behind the luminous</p>

<p>pillar of cloud now and then varied the air by playing on the wrong</p>

<p>side of the bridge or with the back of the bow.  But it did not</p>

<p>matter; the panting shapes spun onwards.</p>

<p>They did not vary their partners if their inclination were to stick</p>

<p>to previous ones.  Changing partners simply meant that a satisfactory</p>

<p>choice had not as yet been arrived at by one or other of the pair,</p>

<p>and by this time every couple had been suitably matched.  It was then</p>

<p>that the ecstasy and the dream began, in which emotion was the matter</p>

<p>of the universe, and matter but an adventitious intrusion likely to</p>

<p>hinder you from spinning where you wanted to spin.</p>

<p>Suddenly there was a dull thump on the ground: a couple had fallen,</p>

<p>and lay in a mixed heap.  The next couple, unable to check its</p>

<p>progress, came toppling over the obstacle.  An inner cloud of dust</p>

<p>rose around the prostrate figures amid the general one of the room,</p>

<p>in which a twitching entanglement of arms and legs was discernible.</p>

<p>"You shall catch it for this, my gentleman, when you get home!" burst</p>

<p>in female accents from the human heap--those of the unhappy partner</p>

<p>of the man whose clumsiness had caused the mishap; she happened</p>

<p>also to be his recently married wife, in which assortment there was</p>

<p>nothing unusual at Trantridge as long as any affection remained</p>

<p>between wedded couples; and, indeed, it was not uncustomary in their</p>

<p>later lives, to avoid making odd lots of the single people between</p>

<p>whom there might be a warm understanding.</p>

<p>A loud laugh from behind Tess's back, in the shade of the garden,</p>

<p>united with the titter within the room.  She looked round, and saw</p>

<p>the red coal of a cigar: Alec d'Urberville was standing there alone.</p>

<p>He beckoned to her, and she reluctantly retreated towards him.</p>

<p>"Well, my Beauty, what are you doing here?"</p>

<p>She was so tired after her long day and her walk that she confided</p>

<p>her trouble to him--that she had been waiting ever since he saw her</p>

<p>to have their company home, because the road at night was strange to</p>

<p>her.  "But it seems they will never leave off, and I really think I</p>

<p>will wait no longer."</p>

<p>"Certainly do not.  I have only a saddle-horse here to-day; but come</p>

<p>to The Flower-de-Luce, and I'll hire a trap, and drive you home with</p>

<p>me."</p>

<p>Tess, though flattered, had never quite got over her original</p>

<p>mistrust of him, and, despite their tardiness, she preferred to walk</p>

<p>home with the work-folk.  So she answered that she was much obliged</p>

<p>to him, but would not trouble him.  "I have said that I will wait for</p>

<p>'em, and they will expect me to now."</p>

<p>"Very well, Miss Independence.  Please yourself...  Then I shall not</p>

<p>hurry...  My good Lord, what a kick-up they are having there!"</p>

<p>He had not put himself forward into the light, but some of them</p>

<p>had perceived him, and his presence led to a slight pause and a</p>

<p>consideration of how the time was flying.  As soon as he had re-lit</p>

<p>a cigar and walked away the Trantridge people began to collect</p>

<p>themselves from amid those who had come in from other farms, and</p>

<p>prepared to leave in a body.  Their bundles and baskets were gathered</p>

<p>up, and half an hour later, when the clock-chime sounded a quarter</p>

<p>past eleven, they were straggling along the lane which led up the</p>

<p>hill towards their homes.</p>

<p>It was a three-mile walk, along a dry white road, made whiter</p>

<p>to-night by the light of the moon.</p>

<p>Tess soon perceived as she walked in the flock, sometimes with this</p>

<p>one, sometimes with that, that the fresh night air was producing</p>

<p>staggerings and serpentine courses among the men who had partaken too</p>

<p>freely; some of the more careless women also were wandering in their</p>

<p>gait--to wit, a dark virago, Car Darch, dubbed Queen of Spades, till</p>

<p>lately a favourite of d'Urberville's; Nancy, her sister, nicknamed</p>

<p>the Queen of Diamonds; and the young married woman who had already</p>

<p>tumbled down.  Yet however terrestrial and lumpy their appearance</p>

<p>just now to the mean unglamoured eye, to themselves the case was</p>

<p>different.  They followed the road with a sensation that they were</p>

<p>soaring along in a supporting medium, possessed of original and</p>

<p>profound thoughts, themselves and surrounding nature forming</p>

<p>an organism of which all the parts harmoniously and joyously</p>

<p>interpenetrated each other.  They were as sublime as the moon and</p>

<p>stars above them, and the moon and stars were as ardent as they.</p>

<p>Tess, however, had undergone such painful experiences of this kind in</p>

<p>her father's house that the discovery of their condition spoilt the</p>

<p>pleasure she was beginning to feel in the moonlight journey.  Yet she</p>

<p>stuck to the party, for reasons above given.</p>

<p>In the open highway they had progressed in scattered order; but now</p>

<p>their route was through a field-gate, and the foremost finding a</p>

<p>difficulty in opening it, they closed up together.</p>

<p>This leading pedestrian was Car the Queen of Spades, who carried a</p>

<p>wicker-basket containing her mother's groceries, her own draperies,</p>

<p>and other purchases for the week.  The basket being large and heavy,</p>

<p>Car had placed it for convenience of porterage on the top of her</p>

<p>head, where it rode on in jeopardized balance as she walked with</p>

<p>arms akimbo.</p>

<p>"Well--whatever is that a-creeping down thy back, Car Darch?" said</p>

<p>one of the group suddenly.</p>

<p>All looked at Car.  Her gown was a light cotton print, and from the</p>

<p>back of her head a kind of rope could be seen descending to some</p>

<p>distance below her waist, like a Chinaman's queue.</p>

<p>"'Tis her hair falling down," said another.</p>

<p>No; it was not her hair: it was a black stream of something oozing</p>

<p>from her basket, and it glistened like a slimy snake in the cold</p>

<p>still rays of the moon.</p>

<p>"'Tis treacle," said an observant matron.</p>

<p>Treacle it was.  Car's poor old grandmother had a weakness for the</p>

<p>sweet stuff.  Honey she had in plenty out of her own hives, but</p>

<p>treacle was what her soul desired, and Car had been about to give her</p>

<p>a treat of surprise.  Hastily lowering the basket the dark girl found</p>

<p>that the vessel containing the syrup had been smashed within.</p>

<p>By this time there had arisen a shout of laughter at the</p>

<p>extraordinary appearance of Car's back, which irritated the dark</p>

<p>queen into getting rid of the disfigurement by the first sudden means</p>

<p>available, and independently of the help of the scoffers.  She rushed</p>

<p>excitedly into the field they were about to cross, and flinging</p>

<p>herself flat on her back upon the grass, began to wipe her gown</p>

<p>as well as she could by spinning horizontally on the herbage and</p>

<p>dragging herself over it upon her elbows.</p>

<p>The laughter rang louder; they clung to the gate, to the posts,</p>

<p>rested on their staves, in the weakness engendered by their</p>

<p>convulsions at the spectacle of Car.  Our heroine, who had hitherto</p>

<p>held her peace, at this wild moment could not help joining in with</p>

<p>the rest.</p>

<p>It was a misfortune--in more ways than one.  No sooner did the dark</p>

<p>queen hear the soberer richer note of Tess among those of the other</p>

<p>work-people than a long-smouldering sense of rivalry inflamed her to</p>

<p>madness.  She sprang to her feet and closely faced the object of her</p>

<p>dislike.</p>

<p>"How darest th' laugh at me, hussy!" she cried.</p>

<p>"I couldn't really help it when t'others did," apologized Tess,</p>

<p>still tittering.</p>

<p>"Ah, th'st think th' beest everybody, dostn't, because th' beest</p>

<p>first favourite with He just now!  But stop a bit, my lady, stop a</p>

<p>bit!  I'm as good as two of such! Look here--here's at 'ee!"</p>

<p>To Tess's horror the dark queen began stripping off the bodice of</p>

<p>her gown--which for the added reason of its ridiculed condition she</p>

<p>was only too glad to be free of--till she had bared her plump neck,</p>

<p>shoulders, and arms to the moonshine, under which they looked as</p>

<p>luminous and beautiful as some Praxitelean creation, in their</p>

<p>possession of the faultless rotundities of a lusty country-girl.</p>

<p>She closed her fists and squared up at Tess.</p>

<p>"Indeed, then, I shall not fight!" said the latter majestically; "and</p>

<p>if I had know you was of that sort, I wouldn't have so let myself</p>

<p>down as to come with such a whorage as this is!"</p>

<p>The rather too inclusive speech brought down a torrent of</p>

<p>vituperation from other quarters upon fair Tess's unlucky head,</p>

<p>particularly from the Queen of Diamonds, who having stood in the</p>

<p>relations to d'Urberville that Car had also been suspected of, united</p>

<p>with the latter against the common enemy.  Several other women also</p>

<p>chimed in, with an animus which none of them would have been so</p>

<p>fatuous as to show but for the rollicking evening they had passed.</p>

<p>Thereupon, finding Tess unfairly browbeaten, the husbands and lovers</p>

<p>tried to make peace by defending her; but the result of that attempt</p>

<p>was directly to increase the war.</p>

<p>Tess was indignant and ashamed.  She no longer minded the loneliness</p>

<p>of the way and the lateness of the hour; her one object was to get</p>

<p>away from the whole crew as soon as possible.  She knew well enough</p>

<p>that the better among them would repent of their passion next day.</p>

<p>They were all now inside the field, and she was edging back to rush</p>

<p>off alone when a horseman emerged almost silently from the corner of</p>

<p>the hedge that screened the road, and Alec d'Urberville looked round</p>

<p>upon them.</p>

<p>"What the devil is all this row about, work-folk?" he asked.</p>

<p>The explanation was not readily forthcoming; and, in truth, he did</p>

<p>not require any.  Having heard their voices while yet some way off he</p>

<p>had ridden creepingly forward, and learnt enough to satisfy himself.</p>

<p>Tess was standing apart from the rest, near the gate.  He bent over</p>

<p>towards her.  "Jump up behind me," he whispered, "and we'll get shot</p>

<p>of the screaming cats in a jiffy!"</p>

<p>She felt almost ready to faint, so vivid was her sense of the crisis.</p>

<p>At almost any other moment of her life she would have refused such</p>

<p>proffered aid and company, as she had refused them several times</p>

<p>before; and now the loneliness would not of itself have forced her</p>

<p>to do otherwise.  But coming as the invitation did at the particular</p>

<p>juncture when fear and indignation at these adversaries could be</p>

<p>transformed by a spring of the foot into a triumph over them, she</p>

<p>abandoned herself to her impulse, climbed the gate, put her toe upon</p>

<p>his instep, and scrambled into the saddle behind him.  The pair were</p>

<p>speeding away into the distant gray by the time that the contentious</p>

<p>revellers became aware of what had happened.</p>

<p>The Queen of Spades forgot the stain on her bodice, and stood</p>

<p>beside the Queen of Diamonds and the new-married, staggering young</p>

<p>woman--all with a gaze of fixity in the direction in which the</p>

<p>horse's tramp was diminishing into silence on the road.</p>

<p>"What be ye looking at?" asked a man who had not observed the</p>

<p>incident.</p>

<p>"Ho-ho-ho!" laughed dark Car.</p>

<p>"Hee-hee-hee!" laughed the tippling bride, as she steadied herself on</p>

<p>the arm of her fond husband.</p>

<p>"Heu-heu-heu!" laughed dark Car's mother, stroking her moustache as</p>

<p>she explained laconically: "Out of the frying-pan into the fire!"</p>

<p>Then these children of the open air, whom even excess of alcohol</p>

<p>could scarce injure permanently, betook themselves to the field-path;</p>

<p>and as they went there moved onward with them, around the shadow of</p>

<p>each one's head, a circle of opalized light, formed by the moon's</p>

<p>rays upon the glistening sheet of dew.  Each pedestrian could see</p>

<p>no halo but his or her own, which never deserted the head-shadow,</p>

<p>whatever its vulgar unsteadiness might be; but adhered to it, and</p>

<p>persistently beautified it; till the erratic motions seemed an</p>

<p>inherent part of the irradiation, and the fumes of their breathing</p>

<p>a component of the night's mist; and the spirit of the scene, and</p>

<p>of the moonlight, and of Nature, seemed harmoniously to mingle with</p>

<p>the spirit of wine.</p>

<p>XI</p>

<p>The twain cantered along for some time without speech, Tess as she</p>

<p>clung to him still panting in her triumph, yet in other respects</p>

<p>dubious.  She had perceived that the horse was not the spirited one</p>

<p>he sometimes rose, and felt no alarm on that score, though her seat</p>

<p>was precarious enough despite her tight hold of him.  She begged him</p>

<p>to slow the animal to a walk, which Alec accordingly did.</p>

<p>"Neatly done, was it not, dear Tess?" he said by and by.</p>

<p>"Yes!" said she.  "I am sure I ought to be much obliged to you."</p>

<p>"And are you?"</p>

<p>She did not reply.</p>

<p>"Tess, why do you always dislike my kissing you?"</p>

<p>"I suppose--because I don't love you."</p>

<p>"You are quite sure?"</p>

<p>"I am angry with you sometimes!"</p>

<p>"Ah, I half feared as much."  Nevertheless, Alec did not object to</p>

<p>that confession.  He knew that anything was better then frigidity.</p>

<p>"Why haven't you told me when I have made you angry?"</p>

<p>"You know very well why.  Because I cannot help myself here."</p>

<p>"I haven't offended you often by love-making?"</p>

<p>"You have sometimes."</p>

<p>"How many times?"</p>

<p>"You know as well as I--too many times."</p>

<p>"Every time I have tried?"</p>

<p>She was silent, and the horse ambled along for a considerable</p>

<p>distance, till a faint luminous fog, which had hung in the hollows</p>

<p>all the evening, became general and enveloped them.  It seemed to</p>

<p>hold the moonlight in suspension, rendering it more pervasive than in</p>

<p>clear air.  Whether on this account, or from absent-mindedness, or</p>

<p>from sleepiness, she did not perceive that they had long ago passed</p>

<p>the point at which the lane to Trantridge branched from the highway,</p>

<p>and that her conductor had not taken the Trantridge track.</p>

<p>She was inexpressibly weary.  She had risen at five o'clock every</p>

<p>morning of that week, had been on foot the whole of each day, and on</p>

<p>this evening had in addition walked the three miles to Chaseborough,</p>

<p>waited three hours for her neighbours without eating or drinking,</p>

<p>her impatience to start them preventing either; she had then walked</p>

<p>a mile of the way home, and had undergone the excitement of the</p>

<p>quarrel, till, with the slow progress of their steed, it was now</p>

<p>nearly one o'clock.  Only once, however, was she overcome by actual</p>

<p>drowsiness.  In that moment of oblivion her head sank gently against</p>

<p>him.</p>

<p>D'Urberville stopped the horse, withdrew his feet from the stirrups,</p>

<p>turned sideways on the saddle, and enclosed her waist with his arm to</p>

<p>support her.</p>

<p>This immediately put her on the defensive, and with one of those</p>

<p>sudden impulses of reprisal to which she was liable she gave him a</p>

<p>little push from her.  In his ticklish position he nearly lost his</p>

<p>balance and only just avoided rolling over into the road, the horse,</p>

<p>though a powerful one, being fortunately the quietest he rode.</p>

<p>"That is devilish unkind!" he said.  "I mean no harm--only to keep</p>

<p>you from falling."</p>

<p>She pondered suspiciously, till, thinking that this might after all</p>

<p>be true, she relented, and said quite humbly, "I beg your pardon,</p>

<p>sir."</p>

<p>"I won't pardon you unless you show some confidence in me.  Good</p>

<p>God!" he burst out, "what am I, to be repulsed so by a mere chit like</p>

<p>you?  For near three mortal months have you trifled with my feelings,</p>

<p>eluded me, and snubbed me; and I won't stand it!"</p>

<p>"I'll leave you to-morrow, sir."</p>

<p>"No, you will not leave me to-morrow!  Will you, I ask once more,</p>

<p>show your belief in me by letting me clasp you with my arm?  Come,</p>

<p>between us two and nobody else, now.  We know each other well; and</p>

<p>you know that I love you, and think you the prettiest girl in the</p>

<p>world, which you are.  Mayn't I treat you as a lover?"</p>

<p>She drew a quick pettish breath of objection, writhing uneasily on</p>

<p>her seat, looked far ahead, and murmured, "I don't know--I wish--how</p>

<p>can I say yes or no when--"</p>

<p>He settled the matter by clasping his arm round her as he desired,</p>

<p>and Tess expressed no further negative.  Thus they sidled</p>

<p>slowly onward till it struck her they had been advancing for an</p>

<p>unconscionable time--far longer than was usually occupied by the</p>

<p>short journey from Chaseborough, even at this walking pace, and</p>

<p>that they were no longer on hard road, but in a mere trackway.</p>

<p>"Why, where be we?" she exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Passing by a wood."</p>

<p>"A wood--what wood?  Surely we are quite out of the road?"</p>

<p>"A bit of The Chase--the oldest wood in England.  It is a lovely</p>

<p>night, and why should we not prolong our ride a little?"</p>

<p>"How could you be so treacherous!" said Tess, between archness and</p>

<p>real dismay, and getting rid of his arm by pulling open his fingers</p>

<p>one by one, though at the risk of slipping off herself.  "Just when</p>

<p>I've been putting such trust in you, and obliging you to please you,</p>

<p>because I thought I had wronged you by that push!  Please set me</p>

<p>down, and let me walk home."</p>

<p>"You cannot walk home, darling, even if the air were clear.  We are</p>

<p>miles away from Trantridge, if I must tell you, and in this growing</p>

<p>fog you might wander for hours among these trees."</p>

<p>"Never mind that," she coaxed.  "Put me down, I beg you.  I don't</p>

<p>mind where it is; only let me get down, sir, please!"</p>

<p>"Very well, then, I will--on one condition.  Having brought you</p>

<p>here to this out-of-the-way place, I feel myself responsible for</p>

<p>your safe-conduct home, whatever you may yourself feel about it.</p>

<p>As to your getting to Trantridge without assistance, it is quite</p>

<p>impossible; for, to tell the truth, dear, owing to this fog, which so</p>

<p>disguises everything, I don't quite know where we are myself.  Now,</p>

<p>if you will promise to wait beside the horse while I walk through the</p>

<p>bushes till I come to some road or house, and ascertain exactly our</p>

<p>whereabouts, I'll deposit you here willingly.  When I come back I'll</p>

<p>give you full directions, and if you insist upon walking you may; or</p>

<p>you may ride--at your pleasure."</p>

<p>She accepted these terms, and slid off on the near side, though not</p>

<p>till he had stolen a cursory kiss.  He sprang down on the other side.</p>

<p>"I suppose I must hold the horse?" said she.</p>

<p>"Oh no; it's not necessary," replied Alec, patting the panting</p>

<p>creature.  "He's had enough of it for to-night."</p>

<p>He turned the horse's head into the bushes, hitched him on to a</p>

<p>bough, and made a sort of couch or nest for her in the deep mass of</p>

<p>dead leaves.</p>

<p>"Now, you sit there," he said.  "The leaves have not got damp as yet.</p>

<p>Just give an eye to the horse--it will be quite sufficient."</p>

<p>He took a few steps away from her, but, returning, said, "By the bye,</p>

<p>Tess, your father has a new cob to-day.  Somebody gave it to him."</p>

<p>"Somebody?  You!"</p>

<p>D'Urberville nodded.</p>

<p>"O how very good of you that is!" she exclaimed, with a painful sense</p>

<p>of the awkwardness of having to thank him just then.</p>

<p>"And the children have some toys."</p>

<p>"I didn't know--you ever sent them anything!" she murmured, much</p>

<p>moved.  "I almost wish you had not--yes, I almost wish it!"</p>

<p>"Why, dear?"</p>

<p>"It--hampers me so."</p>

<p>"Tessy--don't you love me ever so little now?"</p>

<p>"I'm grateful," she reluctantly admitted.  "But I fear I do not--"</p>

<p>The sudden vision of his passion for herself as a factor in this</p>

<p>result so distressed her that, beginning with one slow tear, and</p>

<p>then following with another, she wept outright.</p>

<p>"Don't cry, dear, dear one!  Now sit down here, and wait till I</p>

<p>come."  She passively sat down amid the leaves he had heaped, and</p>

<p>shivered slightly.  "Are you cold?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Not very--a little."</p>

<p>He touched her with his fingers, which sank into her as into down.</p>

<p>"You have only that puffy muslin dress on--how's that?"</p>

<p>"It's my best summer one.  'Twas very warm when I started, and I</p>

<p>didn't know I was going to ride, and that it would be night."</p>

<p>"Nights grow chilly in September.  Let me see."  He pulled off a</p>

<p>light overcoat that he had worn, and put it round her tenderly.</p>

<p>"That's it--now you'll feel warmer," he continued.  "Now, my pretty,</p>

<p>rest there; I shall soon be back again."</p>

<p>Having buttoned the overcoat round her shoulders he plunged into the</p>

<p>webs of vapour which by this time formed veils between the trees.</p>

<p>She could hear the rustling of the branches as he ascended the</p>

<p>adjoining slope, till his movements were no louder than the hopping</p>

<p>of a bird, and finally died away.  With the setting of the moon the</p>

<p>pale light lessened, and Tess became invisible as she fell into</p>

<p>reverie upon the leaves where he had left her.</p>

<p>In the meantime Alec d'Urberville had pushed on up the slope to clear</p>

<p>his genuine doubt as to the quarter of The Chase they were in.  He</p>

<p>had, in fact, ridden quite at random for over an hour, taking any</p>

<p>turning that came to hand in order to prolong companionship with her,</p>

<p>and giving far more attention to Tess's moonlit person than to any</p>

<p>wayside object.  A little rest for the jaded animal being desirable,</p>

<p>he did not hasten his search for landmarks.  A clamber over the</p>

<p>hill into the adjoining vale brought him to the fence of a highway</p>

<p>whose contours he recognized, which settled the question of their</p>

<p>whereabouts.  D'Urberville thereupon turned back; but by this time</p>

<p>the moon had quite gone down, and partly on account of the fog The</p>

<p>Chase was wrapped in thick darkness, although morning was not far</p>

<p>off.  He was obliged to advance with outstretched hands to avoid</p>

<p>contact with the boughs, and discovered that to hit the exact spot</p>

<p>from which he had started was at first entirely beyond him.  Roaming</p>

<p>up and down, round and round, he at length heard a slight movement of</p>

<p>the horse close at hand; and the sleeve of his overcoat unexpectedly</p>

<p>caught his foot.</p>

<p>"Tess!" said d'Urberville.</p>

<p>There was no answer.  The obscurity was now so great that he could</p>

<p>see absolutely nothing but a pale nebulousness at his feet, which</p>

<p>represented the white muslin figure he had left upon the dead leaves.</p>

<p>Everything else was blackness alike.  D'Urberville stooped; and heard</p>

<p>a gentle regular breathing.  He knelt and bent lower, till her breath</p>

<p>warmed his face, and in a moment his cheek was in contact with hers.</p>

<p>She was sleeping soundly, and upon her eyelashes there lingered</p>

<p>tears.</p>

<p>Darkness and silence ruled everywhere around.  Above them rose the</p>

<p>primeval yews and oaks of The Chase, in which there poised gentle</p>

<p>roosting birds in their last nap; and about them stole the hopping</p>

<p>rabbits and hares.  But, might some say, where was Tess's guardian</p>

<p>angel? where was the providence of her simple faith?  Perhaps, like</p>

<p>that other god of whom the ironical Tishbite spoke, he was talking,</p>

<p>or he was pursuing, or he was in a journey, or he was sleeping and</p>

<p>not to be awaked.</p>

<p>Why it was that upon this beautiful feminine tissue, sensitive as</p>

<p>gossamer, and practically blank as snow as yet, there should have</p>

<p>been traced such a coarse pattern as it was doomed to receive; why</p>

<p>so often the coarse appropriates the finer thus, the wrong man the</p>

<p>woman, the wrong woman the man, many thousand years of analytical</p>

<p>philosophy have failed to explain to our sense of order.  One may,</p>

<p>indeed, admit the possibility of a retribution lurking in the present</p>

<p>catastrophe.  Doubtless some of Tess d'Urberville's mailed ancestors</p>

<p>rollicking home from a fray had dealt the same measure even more</p>

<p>ruthlessly towards peasant girls of their time.  But though to visit</p>

<p>the sins of the fathers upon the children may be a morality good</p>

<p>enough for divinities, it is scorned by average human nature; and it</p>

<p>therefore does not mend the matter.</p>

<p>As Tess's own people down in those retreats are never tired of saying</p>

<p>among each other in their fatalistic way: "It was to be."  There</p>

<p>lay the pity of it.  An immeasurable social chasm was to divide our</p>

<p>heroine's personality thereafter from that previous self of hers</p>

<p>who stepped from her mother's door to try her fortune at Trantridge</p>

<p>poultry-farm.</p>

<p>END OF PHASE THE FIRST</p><empty-line /><p>Phase the Second: Maiden No More</p>

<p>XII</p>

<p>The basket was heavy and the bundle was large, but she lugged them</p>

<p>along like a person who did not find her especial burden in material</p>

<p>things.  Occasionally she stopped to rest in a mechanical way by some</p>

<p>gate or post; and then, giving the baggage another hitch upon her</p>

<p>full round arm, went steadily on again.</p>

<p>It was a Sunday morning in late October, about four months after Tess</p>

<p>Durbeyfield's arrival at Trantridge, and some few weeks subsequent to</p>

<p>the night ride in The Chase.  The time was not long past daybreak,</p>

<p>and the yellow luminosity upon the horizon behind her back lighted</p>

<p>the ridge towards which her face was set--the barrier of the vale</p>

<p>wherein she had of late been a stranger--which she would have to</p>

<p>climb over to reach her birthplace.  The ascent was gradual on this</p>

<p>side, and the soil and scenery differed much from those within</p>

<p>Blakemore Vale.  Even the character and accent of the two peoples</p>

<p>had shades of difference, despite the amalgamating effects of a</p>

<p>roundabout railway; so that, though less than twenty miles from the</p>

<p>place of her sojourn at Trantridge, her native village had seemed a</p>

<p>far-away spot.  The field-folk shut in there traded northward and</p>

<p>westward, travelled, courted, and married northward and westward,</p>

<p>thought northward and westward; those on this side mainly directed</p>

<p>their energies and attention to the east and south.</p>

<p>The incline was the same down which d'Urberville had driven her so</p>

<p>wildly on that day in June.  Tess went up the remainder of its length</p>

<p>without stopping, and on reaching the edge of the escarpment gazed</p>

<p>over the familiar green world beyond, now half-veiled in mist.  It</p>

<p>was always beautiful from here; it was terribly beautiful to Tess</p>

<p>to-day, for since her eyes last fell upon it she had learnt that the</p>

<p>serpent hisses where the sweet birds sing, and her views of life had</p>

<p>been totally changed for her by the lesson.  Verily another girl than</p>

<p>the simple one she had been at home was she who, bowed by thought,</p>

<p>stood still here, and turned to look behind her. She could not bear</p>

<p>to look forward into the Vale.</p>

<p>Ascending by the long white road that Tess herself had just laboured</p>

<p>up, she saw a two-wheeled vehicle, beside which walked a man, who</p>

<p>held up his hand to attract her attention.</p>

<p>She obeyed the signal to wait for him with unspeculative repose, and</p>

<p>in a few minutes man and horse stopped beside her.</p>

<p>"Why did you slip away by stealth like this?" said d'Urberville, with</p>

<p>upbraiding breathlessness; "on a Sunday morning, too, when people</p>

<p>were all in bed!  I only discovered it by accident, and I have been</p>

<p>driving like the deuce to overtake you.  Just look at the mare.  Why</p>

<p>go off like this?  You know that nobody wished to hinder your going.</p>

<p>And how unnecessary it has been for you to toil along on foot, and</p>

<p>encumber yourself with this heavy load!  I have followed like a</p>

<p>madman, simply to drive you the rest of the distance, if you won't</p>

<p>come back."</p>

<p>"I shan't come back," said she.</p>

<p>"I thought you wouldn't--I said so!  Well, then, put up your basket,</p>

<p>and let me help you on."</p>

<p>She listlessly placed her basket and bundle within the dog-cart, and</p>

<p>stepped up, and they sat side by side.  She had no fear of him now,</p>

<p>and in the cause of her confidence her sorrow lay.</p>

<p>D'Urberville mechanically lit a cigar, and the journey was continued</p>

<p>with broken unemotional conversation on the commonplace objects by</p>

<p>the wayside.  He had quite forgotten his struggle to kiss her when,</p>

<p>in the early summer, they had driven in the opposite direction along</p>

<p>the same road.  But she had not, and she sat now, like a puppet,</p>

<p>replying to his remarks in monosyllables.  After some miles they came</p>

<p>in view of the clump of trees beyond which the village of Marlott</p>

<p>stood.  It was only then that her still face showed the least</p>

<p>emotion, a tear or two beginning to trickle down.</p>

<p>"What are you crying for?" he coldly asked.</p>

<p>"I was only thinking that I was born over there," murmured Tess.</p>

<p>"Well--we must all be born somewhere."</p>

<p>"I wish I had never been born--there or anywhere else!"</p>

<p>"Pooh!  Well, if you didn't wish to come to Trantridge why did you</p>

<p>come?"</p>

<p>She did not reply.</p>

<p>"You didn't come for love of me, that I'll swear."</p>

<p>"'Tis quite true.  If I had gone for love o' you, if I had ever</p>

<p>sincerely loved you, if I loved you still, I should not so loathe and</p>

<p>hate myself for my weakness as I do now! ...  My eyes were dazed by</p>

<p>you for a little, and that was all."</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders.  She resumed--</p>

<p>"I didn't understand your meaning till it was too late."</p>

<p>"That's what every woman says."</p>

<p>"How can you dare to use such words!" she cried, turning impetuously</p>

<p>upon him, her eyes flashing as the latent spirit (of which he was to</p>

<p>see more some day) awoke in her.  "My God!  I could knock you out of</p>

<p>the gig!  Did it never strike your mind that what every woman says</p>

<p>some women may feel?"</p>

<p>"Very well," he said, laughing; "I am sorry to wound you.  I did</p>

<p>wrong--I admit it."  He dropped into some little bitterness as he</p>

<p>continued: "Only you needn't be so everlastingly flinging it in my</p>

<p>face.  I am ready to pay to the uttermost farthing.  You know you</p>

<p>need not work in the fields or the dairies again.  You know you may</p>

<p>clothe yourself with the best, instead of in the bald plain way you</p>

<p>have lately affected, as if you couldn't get a ribbon more than you</p>

<p>earn."</p>

<p>Her lip lifted slightly, though there was little scorn, as a rule,</p>

<p>in her large and impulsive nature.</p>

<p>"I have said I will not take anything more from you, and I will</p>

<p>not--I cannot!  I SHOULD be your creature to go on doing that, and</p>

<p>I won't!"</p>

<p>"One would think you were a princess from your manner, in addition</p>

<p>to a true and original d'Urberville--ha! ha!  Well, Tess, dear, I</p>

<p>can say no more.  I suppose I am a bad fellow--a damn bad fellow.</p>

<p>I was born bad, and I have lived bad, and I shall die bad in all</p>

<p>probability.  But, upon my lost soul, I won't be bad towards you</p>

<p>again, Tess.  And if certain circumstances should arise--you</p>

<p>understand--in which you are in the least need, the least difficulty,</p>

<p>send me one line, and you shall have by return whatever you require.</p>

<p>I may not be at Trantridge--I am going to London for a time--I can't</p>

<p>stand the old woman.  But all letters will be forwarded."</p>

<p>She said that she did not wish him to drive her further, and they</p>

<p>stopped just under the clump of trees.  D'Urberville alighted, and</p>

<p>lifted her down bodily in his arms, afterwards placing her articles</p>

<p>on the ground beside her.  She bowed to him slightly, her eye just</p>

<p>lingering in his; and then she turned to take the parcels for</p>

<p>departure.</p>

<p>Alec d'Urberville removed his cigar, bent towards her, and said--</p>

<p>"You are not going to turn away like that, dear!  Come!"</p>

<p>"If you wish," she answered indifferently.  "See how you've mastered</p>

<p>me!"</p>

<p>She thereupon turned round and lifted her face to his, and remained</p>

<p>like a marble term while he imprinted a kiss upon her cheek--half</p>

<p>perfunctorily, half as if zest had not yet quite died out.  Her eyes</p>

<p>vaguely rested upon the remotest trees in the lane while the kiss was</p>

<p>given, as though she were nearly unconscious of what he did.</p>

<p>"Now the other side, for old acquaintance' sake."</p>

<p>She turned her head in the same passive way, as one might turn at the</p>

<p>request of a sketcher or hairdresser, and he kissed the other side,</p>

<p>his lips touching cheeks that were damp and smoothly chill as the</p>

<p>skin of the mushrooms in the fields around.</p>

<p>"You don't give me your mouth and kiss me back.  You never willingly</p>

<p>do that--you'll never love me, I fear."</p>

<p>"I have said so, often.  It is true.  I have never really and truly</p>

<p>loved you, and I think I never can."  She added mournfully, "Perhaps,</p>

<p>of all things, a lie on this thing would do the most good to me now;</p>

<p>but I have honour enough left, little as 'tis, not to tell that lie.</p>

<p>If I did love you, I may have the best o' causes for letting you know</p>

<p>it.  But I don't."</p>

<p>He emitted a laboured breath, as if the scene were getting rather</p>

<p>oppressive to his heart, or to his conscience, or to his gentility.</p>

<p>"Well, you are absurdly melancholy, Tess.  I have no</p>

<p>reason for flattering you now, and I can say plainly</p>

<p>that you need not be so sad.  You can hold your own for</p>

<p>beauty against any woman of these parts, gentle or</p>

<p>simple; I say it to you as a practical man and</p>

<p>well-wisher.  If you are wise you will show it to the</p>

<p>world more than you do before it fades...  And yet,</p>

<p>Tess, will you come back to me!  Upon my soul, I don't</p>

<p>like to let you go like this!"</p>

<p>"Never, never!  I made up my mind as soon as I saw--what I ought to</p>

<p>have seen sooner; and I won't come."</p>

<p>"Then good morning, my four months' cousin--good-bye!"</p>

<p>He leapt up lightly, arranged the reins, and was gone between the</p>

<p>tall red-berried hedges.</p>

<p>Tess did not look after him, but slowly wound along the crooked lane.</p>

<p>It was still early, and though the sun's lower limb was just free of</p>

<p>the hill, his rays, ungenial and peering, addressed the eye rather</p>

<p>than the touch as yet.  There was not a human soul near.  Sad October</p>

<p>and her sadder self seemed the only two existences haunting that</p>

<p>lane.</p>

<p>As she walked, however, some footsteps approached behind her, the</p>

<p>footsteps of a man; and owing to the briskness of his advance he was</p>

<p>close at her heels and had said "Good morning" before she had been</p>

<p>long aware of his propinquity.  He appeared to be an artisan of some</p>

<p>sort, and carried a tin pot of red paint in his hand.  He asked</p>

<p>in a business-like manner if he should take her basket, which she</p>

<p>permitted him to do, walking beside him.</p>

<p>"It is early to be astir this Sabbath morn!" he said cheerfully.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Tess.</p>

<p>"When most people are at rest from their week's work."</p>

<p>She also assented to this.</p>

<p>"Though I do more real work to-day than all the week besides."</p>

<p>"Do you?"</p>

<p>"All the week I work for the glory of man, and on Sunday for the</p>

<p>glory of God.  That's more real than the other--hey?  I have a little</p>

<p>to do here at this stile."  The man turned, as he spoke, to an</p>

<p>opening at the roadside leading into a pasture.  "If you'll wait a</p>

<p>moment," he added, "I shall not be long."</p>

<p>As he had her basket she could not well do otherwise; and she waited,</p>

<p>observing him.  He set down her basket and the tin pot, and stirring</p>

<p>the paint with the brush that was in it began painting large square</p>

<p>letters on the middle board of the three composing the stile, placing</p>

<p>a comma after each word, as if to give pause while that word was</p>

<p>driven well home to the reader's heart--</p>

<p>      THY, DAMNATION, SLUMBERETH, NOT.</p>

<p>                         2 Pet. ii. 3.</p>

<p>Against the peaceful landscape, the pale, decaying tints of the</p>

<p>copses, the blue air of the horizon, and the lichened stile-boards,</p>

<p>these staring vermilion words shone forth.  They seemed to shout</p>

<p>themselves out and make the atmosphere ring.  Some people might have</p>

<p>cried "Alas, poor Theology!" at the hideous defacement--the last</p>

<p>grotesque phase of a creed which had served mankind well in its time.</p>

<p>But the words entered Tess with accusatory horror.  It was as if this</p>

<p>man had known her recent history; yet he was a total stranger.</p>

<p>Having finished his text he picked up her basket, and she</p>

<p>mechanically resumed her walk beside him.</p>

<p>"Do you believe what you paint?" she asked in low tones.</p>

<p>"Believe that tex?  Do I believe in my own existence!"</p>

<p>"But," said she tremulously, "suppose your sin was not of your own</p>

<p>seeking?"</p>

<p>He shook his head.</p>

<p>"I cannot split hairs on that burning query," he said.  "I have</p>

<p>walked hundreds of miles this past summer, painting these texes on</p>

<p>every wall, gate, and stile the length and breadth of this district.</p>

<p>I leave their application to the hearts of the people who read 'em."</p>

<p>"I think they are horrible," said Tess.  "Crushing!  Killing!"</p>

<p>"That's what they are meant to be!" he replied in a trade voice.</p>

<p>"But you should read my hottest ones--them I kips for slums and</p>

<p>seaports.  They'd make ye wriggle!  Not but what this is a very good</p>

<p>tex for rural districts. ...  Ah--there's a nice bit of blank wall up</p>

<p>by that barn standing to waste.  I must put one there--one that it</p>

<p>will be good for dangerous young females like yerself to heed.  Will</p>

<p>ye wait, missy?"</p>

<p>"No," said she; and taking her basket Tess trudged on. A little way</p>

<p>forward she turned her head.  The old gray wall began to advertise</p>

<p>a similar fiery lettering to the first, with a strange and unwonted</p>

<p>mien, as if distressed at duties it had never before been called upon</p>

<p>to perform.  It was with a sudden flush that she read and realized</p>

<p>what was to be the inscription he was now halfway through--</p>

<p>      THOU, SHALT, NOT, COMMIT--</p>

<p>Her cheerful friend saw her looking, stopped his brush, and shouted--</p>

<p>"If you want to ask for edification on these things of moment,</p>

<p>there's a very earnest good man going to preach a charity-sermon</p>

<p>to-day in the parish you are going to--Mr Clare of Emminster.  I'm</p>

<p>not of his persuasion now, but he's a good man, and he'll expound as</p>

<p>well as any parson I know.  'Twas he began the work in me."</p>

<p>But Tess did not answer; she throbbingly resumed her walk, her eyes</p>

<p>fixed on the ground.  "Pooh--I don't believe God said such things!"</p>

<p>she murmured contemptuously when her flush had died away.</p>

<p>A plume of smoke soared up suddenly from her father's chimney, the</p>

<p>sight of which made her heart ache.  The aspect of the interior, when</p>

<p>she reached it, made her heart ache more.  Her mother, who had just</p>

<p>come down stairs, turned to greet her from the fireplace, where she</p>

<p>was kindling barked-oak twigs under the breakfast kettle.  The young</p>

<p>children were still above, as was also her father, it being Sunday</p>

<p>morning, when he felt justified in lying an additional half-hour.</p>

<p>"Well!--my dear Tess!" exclaimed her surprised mother, jumping up and</p>

<p>kissing the girl. "How be ye?  I didn't see you till you was in upon</p>

<p>me!  Have you come home to be married?"</p>

<p>"No, I have not come for that, mother."</p>

<p>"Then for a holiday?"</p>

<p>"Yes--for a holiday; for a long holiday," said Tess.</p>

<p>"What, isn't your cousin going to do the handsome thing?"</p>

<p>"He's not my cousin, and he's not going to marry me."</p>

<p>Her mother eyed her narrowly.</p>

<p>"Come, you have not told me all," she said.</p>

<p>Then Tess went up to her mother, put her face upon Joan's neck, and</p>

<p>told.</p>

<p>"And yet th'st not got him to marry 'ee!" reiterated her mother. "Any</p>

<p>woman would have done it but you, after that!"</p>

<p>"Perhaps any woman would except me."</p>

<p>"It would have been something like a story to come back with, if</p>

<p>you had!" continued Mrs Durbeyfield, ready to burst into tears of</p>

<p>vexation.  "After all the talk about you and him which has reached</p>

<p>us here, who would have expected it to end like this!  Why didn't ye</p>

<p>think of doing some good for your family instead o' thinking only of</p>

<p>yourself?  See how I've got to teave and slave, and your poor weak</p>

<p>father with his heart clogged like a dripping-pan.  I did hope for</p>

<p>something to come out o' this!  To see what a pretty pair you and he</p>

<p>made that day when you drove away together four months ago!  See what</p>

<p>he has given us--all, as we thought, because we were his kin.  But if</p>

<p>he's not, it must have been done because of his love for 'ee.  And</p>

<p>yet you've not got him to marry!"</p>

<p>Get Alec d'Urberville in the mind to marry her!  He marry HER!  On</p>

<p>matrimony he had never once said a word.  And what if he had?  How a</p>

<p>convulsive snatching at social salvation might have impelled her to</p>

<p>answer him she could not say.  But her poor foolish mother little</p>

<p>knew her present feeling towards this man.  Perhaps it was unusual</p>

<p>in the circumstances, unlucky, unaccountable; but there it was; and</p>

<p>this, as she had said, was what made her detest herself.  She had</p>

<p>never wholly cared for him; she did not at all care for him now.  She</p>

<p>had dreaded him, winced before him, succumbed to adroit advantages</p>

<p>he took of her helplessness; then, temporarily blinded by his ardent</p>

<p>manners, had been stirred to confused surrender awhile: had suddenly</p>

<p>despised and disliked him, and had run away.  That was all.  Hate him</p>

<p>she did not quite; but he was dust and ashes to her, and even for her</p>

<p>name's sake she scarcely wished to marry him.</p>

<p>"You ought to have been more careful if you didn't mean to get him to</p>

<p>make you his wife!"</p>

<p>"O mother, my mother!" cried the agonized girl, turning passionately</p>

<p>upon her parent as if her poor heart would break.  "How could I be</p>

<p>expected to know?  I was a child when I left this house four months</p>

<p>ago.  Why didn't you tell me there was danger in men-folk?  Why</p>

<p>didn't you warn me?  Ladies know what to fend hands against, because</p>

<p>they read novels that tell them of these tricks; but I never had the</p>

<p>chance o' learning in that way, and you did not help me!"</p>

<p>Her mother was subdued.</p>

<p>"I thought if I spoke of his fond feelings and what they might lead</p>

<p>to, you would be hontish wi' him and lose your chance," she murmured,</p>

<p>wiping her eyes with her apron.  "Well, we must make the best of it,</p>

<p>I suppose.  'Tis nater, after all, and what do please God!"</p>

<p>XIII</p>

<p>The event of Tess Durbeyfield's return from the manor of her bogus</p>

<p>kinsfolk was rumoured abroad, if rumour be not too large a word for</p>

<p>a space of a square mile.  In the afternoon several young girls of</p>

<p>Marlott, former schoolfellows and acquaintances of Tess, called to</p>

<p>see her, arriving dressed in their best starched and ironed, as</p>

<p>became visitors to a person who had made a transcendent conquest (as</p>

<p>they supposed), and sat round the room looking at her with great</p>

<p>curiosity.  For the fact that it was this said thirty-first cousin,</p>

<p>Mr d'Urberville, who had fallen in love with her, a gentleman</p>

<p>not altogether local, whose reputation as a reckless gallant and</p>

<p>heartbreaker was beginning to spread beyond the immediate boundaries</p>

<p>of Trantridge, lent Tess's supposed position, by its fearsomeness, a</p>

<p>far higher fascination that it would have exercised if unhazardous.</p>

<p>Their interest was so deep that the younger ones whispered when her</p>

<p>back was turned--</p>

<p>"How pretty she is; and how that best frock do set her off!  I</p>

<p>believe it cost an immense deal, and that it was a gift from him."</p>

<p>Tess, who was reaching up to get the tea-things from the</p>

<p>corner-cupboard, did not hear these commentaries.  If she had heard</p>

<p>them, she might soon have set her friends right on the matter.  But</p>

<p>her mother heard, and Joan's simple vanity, having been denied the</p>

<p>hope of a dashing marriage, fed itself as well as it could upon</p>

<p>the sensation of a dashing flirtation.  Upon the whole she felt</p>

<p>gratified, even though such a limited and evanescent triumph should</p>

<p>involve her daughter's reputation; it might end in marriage yet, and</p>

<p>in the warmth of her responsiveness to their admiration she invited</p>

<p>her visitors to stay to tea.</p>

<p>Their chatter, their laughter, their good-humoured innuendoes, above</p>

<p>all, their flashes and flickerings of envy, revived Tess's spirits</p>

<p>also; and, as the evening wore on, she caught the infection of their</p>

<p>excitement, and grew almost gay.  The marble hardness left her face,</p>

<p>she moved with something of her old bounding step, and flushed in all</p>

<p>her young beauty.</p>

<p>At moments, in spite of thought, she would reply to their inquiries</p>

<p>with a manner of superiority, as if recognizing that her experiences</p>

<p>in the field of courtship had, indeed, been slightly enviable.  But</p>

<p>so far was she from being, in the words of Robert South, "in love</p>

<p>with her own ruin," that the illusion was transient as lightning;</p>

<p>cold reason came back to mock her spasmodic weakness; the ghastliness</p>

<p>of her momentary pride would convict her, and recall her to reserved</p>

<p>listlessness again.</p>

<p>And the despondency of the next morning's dawn, when it was no longer</p>

<p>Sunday, but Monday; and no best clothes; and the laughing visitors</p>

<p>were gone, and she awoke alone in her old bed, the innocent younger</p>

<p>children breathing softly around her.  In place of the excitement of</p>

<p>her return, and the interest it had inspired, she saw before her a</p>

<p>long and stony highway which she had to tread, without aid, and with</p>

<p>little sympathy.  Her depression was then terrible, and she could</p>

<p>have hidden herself in a tomb.</p>

<p>In the course of a few weeks Tess revived sufficiently to show</p>

<p>herself so far as was necessary to get to church one Sunday morning.</p>

<p>She liked to hear the chanting--such as it was--and the old Psalms,</p>

<p>and to join in the Morning Hymn.  That innate love of melody, which</p>

<p>she had inherited from her ballad-singing mother, gave the simplest</p>

<p>music a power over her which could well-nigh drag her heart out of</p>

<p>her bosom at times.</p>

<p>To be as much out of observation as possible for reasons of her own,</p>

<p>and to escape the gallantries of the young men, she set out before</p>

<p>the chiming began, and took a back seat under the gallery, close to</p>

<p>the lumber, where only old men and women came, and where the bier</p>

<p>stood on end among the churchyard tools.</p>

<p>Parishioners dropped in by twos and threes, deposited themselves</p>

<p>in rows before her, rested three-quarters of a minute on their</p>

<p>foreheads as if they were praying, though they were not; then sat up,</p>

<p>and looked around. When the chants came on, one of her favourites</p>

<p>happened to be chosen among the rest--the old double chant</p>

<p>"Langdon"--but she did not know what it was called, though she would</p>

<p>much have liked to know.  She thought, without exactly wording the</p>

<p>thought, how strange and god-like was a composer's power, who from</p>

<p>the grave could lead through sequences of emotion, which he alone had</p>

<p>felt at first, a girl like her who had never heard of his name, and</p>

<p>never would have a clue to his personality.</p>

<p>The people who had turned their heads turned them again as the</p>

<p>service proceeded; and at last observing her, they whispered to each</p>

<p>other.  She knew what their whispers were about, grew sick at heart,</p>

<p>and felt that she could come to church no more.</p>

<p>The bedroom which she shared with some of the children formed her</p>

<p>retreat more continually than ever.  Here, under her few square yards</p>

<p>of thatch, she watched winds, and snows, and rains, gorgeous sunsets,</p>

<p>and successive moons at their full.  So close kept she that at length</p>

<p>almost everybody thought she had gone away.</p>

<p>The only exercise that Tess took at this time was after dark; and it</p>

<p>was then, when out in the woods, that she seemed least solitary.  She</p>

<p>knew how to hit to a hair's-breadth that moment of evening when the</p>

<p>light and the darkness are so evenly balanced that the constraint of</p>

<p>day and the suspense of night neutralize each other, leaving absolute</p>

<p>mental liberty.  It is then that the plight of being alive becomes</p>

<p>attenuated to its least possible dimensions.  She had no fear of the</p>

<p>shadows; her sole idea seemed to be to shun mankind--or rather that</p>

<p>cold accretion called the world, which, so terrible in the mass, is</p>

<p>so unformidable, even pitiable, in its units.</p>

<p>On these lonely hills and dales her quiescent glide was of a piece</p>

<p>with the element she moved in.  Her flexuous and stealthy figure</p>

<p>became an integral part of the scene.  At times her whimsical fancy</p>

<p>would intensify natural processes around her till they seemed a part</p>

<p>of her own story.  Rather they became a part of it; for the world is</p>

<p>only a psychological phenomenon, and what they seemed they were.  The</p>

<p>midnight airs and gusts, moaning amongst the tightly-wrapped buds and</p>

<p>bark of the winter twigs, were formulae of bitter reproach.  A wet</p>

<p>day was the expression of irremediable grief at her weakness in the</p>

<p>mind of some vague ethical being whom she could not class definitely</p>

<p>as the God of her childhood, and could not comprehend as any other.</p>

<p>But this encompassment of her own characterization, based on shreds</p>

<p>of convention, peopled by phantoms and voices antipathetic to her,</p>

<p>was a sorry and mistaken creation of Tess's fancy--a cloud of moral</p>

<p>hobgoblins by which she was terrified without reason.  It was they</p>

<p>that were out of harmony with the actual world, not she.  Walking</p>

<p>among the sleeping birds in the hedges, watching the skipping rabbits</p>

<p>on a moonlit warren, or standing under a pheasant-laden bough, she</p>

<p>looked upon herself as a figure of Guilt intruding into the haunts</p>

<p>of Innocence.  But all the while she was making a distinction where</p>

<p>there was no difference.  Feeling herself in antagonism, she was</p>

<p>quite in accord.  She had been made to break an accepted social law,</p>

<p>but no law known to the environment in which she fancied herself such</p>

<p>an anomaly.</p>

<p>XIV</p>

<p>It was a hazy sunrise in August.  The denser nocturnal vapours,</p>

<p>attacked by the warm beams, were dividing and shrinking into isolated</p>

<p>fleeces within hollows and coverts, where they waited till they</p>

<p>should be dried away to nothing.</p>

<p>The sun, on account of the mist, had a curious sentient, personal</p>

<p>look, demanding the masculine pronoun for its adequate expression.</p>

<p>His present aspect, coupled with the lack of all human forms in the</p>

<p>scene, explained the old-time heliolatries in a moment.  One could</p>

<p>feel that a saner religion had never prevailed under the sky.  The</p>

<p>luminary was a golden-haired, beaming, mild-eyed, God-like creature,</p>

<p>gazing down in the vigour and intentness of youth upon an earth that</p>

<p>was brimming with interest for him.</p>

<p>His light, a little later, broke though chinks of cottage shutters,</p>

<p>throwing stripes like red-hot pokers upon cupboards, chests of</p>

<p>drawers, and other furniture within; and awakening harvesters who</p>

<p>were not already astir.</p>

<p>But of all ruddy things that morning the brightest were two broad</p>

<p>arms of painted wood, which rose from the margin of yellow cornfield</p>

<p>hard by Marlott village.  They, with two others below, formed the</p>

<p>revolving Maltese cross of the reaping-machine, which had been</p>

<p>brought to the field on the previous evening to be ready for</p>

<p>operations this day.  The paint with which they were smeared,</p>

<p>intensified in hue by the sunlight, imparted to them a look of</p>

<p>having been dipped in liquid fire.</p>

<p>The field had already been "opened"; that is to say, a lane a few</p>

<p>feet wide had been hand-cut through the wheat along the whole</p>

<p>circumference of the field for the first passage of the horses and</p>

<p>machine.</p>

<p>Two groups, one of men and lads, the other of women, had come down</p>

<p>the lane just at the hour when the shadows of the eastern hedge-top</p>

<p>struck the west hedge midway, so that the heads of the groups were</p>

<p>enjoying sunrise while their feet were still in the dawn.  They</p>

<p>disappeared from the lane between the two stone posts which flanked</p>

<p>the nearest field-gate.</p>

<p>Presently there arose from within a ticking like the love-making of</p>

<p>the grasshopper.  The machine had begun, and a moving concatenation</p>

<p>of three horses and the aforesaid long rickety machine was visible</p>

<p>over the gate, a driver sitting  upon one of the hauling horses,</p>

<p>and an attendant on the seat of the implement.  Along one side of</p>

<p>the field the whole wain went, the arms of the mechanical reaper</p>

<p>revolving slowly, till it passed down the hill quite out of sight.</p>

<p>In a minute it came up on the other side of the field at the same</p>

<p>equable pace; the glistening brass star in the forehead of the fore</p>

<p>horse first catching the eye as it rose into view over the stubble,</p>

<p>then the bright arms, and then the whole machine.</p>

<p>The narrow lane of stubble encompassing the field grew wider with</p>

<p>each circuit, and the standing corn was reduced to a smaller area as</p>

<p>the morning wore on.  Rabbits, hares, snakes, rats, mice, retreated</p>

<p>inwards as into a fastness, unaware of the ephemeral nature of their</p>

<p>refuge, and of the doom that awaited them later in the day when,</p>

<p>their covert shrinking to a more and more horrible narrowness, they</p>

<p>were huddled together, friends and foes, till the last few yards of</p>

<p>upright wheat fell also under the teeth of the unerring reaper, and</p>

<p>they were every one put to death by the sticks and stones of the</p>

<p>harvesters.</p>

<p>The reaping-machine left the fallen corn behind it in little heaps,</p>

<p>each heap being of the quantity for a sheaf; and upon these the</p>

<p>active binders in the rear laid their hands--mainly women, but some</p>

<p>of them men in print shirts, and trousers supported round their</p>

<p>waists by leather straps, rendering useless the two buttons behind,</p>

<p>which twinkled and bristled with sunbeams at every movement of each</p>

<p>wearer, as if they were a pair of eyes in the small of his back.</p>

<p>But those of the other sex were the most interesting of this company</p>

<p>of binders, by reason of the charm which is acquired by woman when</p>

<p>she becomes part and parcel of outdoor nature, and is not merely</p>

<p>an object set down therein as at ordinary times.  A field-man is a</p>

<p>personality afield; a field-woman is a portion of the field; she had</p>

<p>somehow lost her own margin, imbibed the essence of her surrounding,</p>

<p>and assimilated herself with it.</p>

<p>The women--or rather girls, for they were mostly young--wore drawn</p>

<p>cotton bonnets with great flapping curtains to keep off the sun, and</p>

<p>gloves to prevent their hands being wounded by the stubble.  There</p>

<p>was one wearing a pale pink jacket, another in a cream-coloured</p>

<p>tight-sleeved gown, another in a petticoat as red as the arms of the</p>

<p>reaping-machine; and others, older, in the brown-rough "wropper"</p>

<p>or over-all--the old-established and most appropriate dress of the</p>

<p>field-woman, which the young ones were abandoning.  This morning the</p>

<p>eye returns involuntarily to the girl in the pink cotton jacket, she</p>

<p>being the most flexuous and finely-drawn figure of them all.  But</p>

<p>her bonnet is pulled so far over her brow that none of her face is</p>

<p>disclosed while she binds, though her complexion may be guessed from</p>

<p>a stray twine or two of dark brown hair which extends below the</p>

<p>curtain of her bonnet.  Perhaps one reason why she seduces casual</p>

<p>attention is that she never courts it, though the other women often</p>

<p>gaze around them.</p>

<p>Her binding proceeds with clock-like monotony.  From the sheaf last</p>

<p>finished she draws a handful of ears, patting their tips with her</p>

<p>left palm to bring them even.  Then, stooping low, she moves forward,</p>

<p>gathering the corn with both hands against her knees, and pushing</p>

<p>her left gloved hand under the bundle to meet the right on the other</p>

<p>side, holding the corn in an embrace like that of a lover.  She</p>

<p>brings the ends of the bond together, and kneels on the sheaf while</p>

<p>she ties it, beating back her skirts now and then when lifted by the</p>

<p>breeze.  A bit of her naked arm is visible between the buff leather</p>

<p>of the gauntlet and the sleeve of her gown; and as the day wears on</p>

<p>its feminine smoothness becomes scarified by the stubble and bleeds.</p>

<p>At intervals she stands up to rest, and to retie her disarranged</p>

<p>apron, or to pull her bonnet straight.  Then one can see the oval</p>

<p>face of a handsome young woman with deep dark eyes and long heavy</p>

<p>clinging tresses, which seem to clasp in a beseeching way anything</p>

<p>they fall against.  The cheeks are paler, the teeth more regular,</p>

<p>the red lips thinner than is usual in a country-bred girl.</p>

<p>It is Tess Durbeyfield, otherwise d'Urberville, somewhat changed--the</p>

<p>same, but not the same; at the present stage of her existence living</p>

<p>as a stranger and an alien here, though it was no strange land that</p>

<p>she was in.  After a long seclusion she had come to a resolve to</p>

<p>undertake outdoor work in her native village, the busiest season of</p>

<p>the year in the agricultural world having arrived, and nothing that</p>

<p>she could do within the house being so remunerative for the time as</p>

<p>harvesting in the fields.</p>

<p>The movements of the other women were more or less similar to Tess's,</p>

<p>the whole bevy of them drawing together like dancers in a quadrille</p>

<p>at the completion of a sheaf by each, every one placing her sheaf on</p>

<p>end against those of the rest, till a shock, or "stitch" as it was</p>

<p>here called, of ten or a dozen was formed.</p>

<p>They went to breakfast, and came again, and the work proceeded as</p>

<p>before.  As the hour of eleven drew near a person watching her might</p>

<p>have noticed that every now and then Tess's glance flitted wistfully</p>

<p>to the brow of the hill, though she did not pause in her sheafing.</p>

<p>On the verge of the hour the heads of a group of children, of ages</p>

<p>ranging from six to fourteen, rose over the stubbly convexity of the</p>

<p>hill.</p>

<p>The face of Tess flushed slightly, but still she did not pause.</p>

<p>The eldest of the comers, a girl who wore a triangular shawl, its</p>

<p>corner draggling on the stubble, carried in her arms what at first</p>

<p>sight seemed to be a doll, but proved to be an infant in long</p>

<p>clothes.  Another brought some lunch.  The harvesters ceased working,</p>

<p>took their provisions, and sat down against one of the shocks.  Here</p>

<p>they fell to, the men plying a stone jar freely, and passing round a</p>

<p>cup.</p>

<p>Tess Durbeyfield had been one of the last to suspend her labours.</p>

<p>She sat down at the end of the shock, her face turned somewhat away</p>

<p>from her companions.  When she had deposited herself a man in a</p>

<p>rabbit-skin cap, and with a red handkerchief tucked into his belt,</p>

<p>held the cup of ale over the top of the shock for her to drink.  But</p>

<p>she did not accept his offer.  As soon as her lunch was spread she</p>

<p>called up the big girl, her sister, and took the baby of her, who,</p>

<p>glad to be relieved of the burden, went away to the next shock and</p>

<p>joined the other children playing there.  Tess, with a curiously</p>

<p>stealthy yet courageous movement, and with a still rising colour,</p>

<p>unfastened her frock and began suckling the child.</p>

<p>The men who sat nearest considerately turned their faces towards the</p>

<p>other end of the field, some of them beginning to smoke; one, with</p>

<p>absent-minded fondness, regretfully stroking the jar that would no</p>

<p>longer yield a stream.  All the women but Tess fell into animated</p>

<p>talk, and adjusted the disarranged knots of their hair.</p>

<p>When the infant had taken its fill, the young mother sat it upright</p>

<p>in her lap, and looking into the far distance, dandled it with a</p>

<p>gloomy indifference that was almost dislike; then all of a sudden she</p>

<p>fell to violently kissing it some dozens of times, as if she could</p>

<p>never leave off, the child crying at the vehemence of an onset which</p>

<p>strangely combined passionateness with contempt.</p>

<p>"She's fond of that there child, though she mid pretend to hate en,</p>

<p>and say she wishes the baby and her too were in the churchyard,"</p>

<p>observed the woman in the red petticoat.</p>

<p>"She'll soon leave off saying that," replied the one in buff. "Lord,</p>

<p>'tis wonderful what a body can get used to o' that sort in time!"</p>

<p>"A little more than persuading had to do wi' the coming o't, I</p>

<p>reckon.  There were they that heard a sobbing one night last year in</p>

<p>The Chase; and it mid ha' gone hard wi' a certain party if folks had</p>

<p>come along."</p>

<p>"Well, a little more, or a little less, 'twas a thousand pities that</p>

<p>it should have happened to she, of all others.  But 'tis always the</p>

<p>comeliest!  The plain ones be as safe as churches--hey, Jenny?"  The</p>

<p>speaker turned to one of the group who certainly was not ill-defined</p>

<p>as plain.</p>

<p>It was a thousand pities, indeed; it was impossible for even an enemy</p>

<p>to feel otherwise on looking at Tess as she sat there, with her</p>

<p>flower-like mouth and large tender eyes, neither black nor blue nor</p>

<p>grey nor violet; rather all those shades together, and a hundred</p>

<p>others, which could be seen if one looked into their irises--shade</p>

<p>behind shade--tint beyond tint--around pupils that had no bottom; an</p>

<p>almost standard woman, but for the slight incautiousness of character</p>

<p>inherited from her race.</p>

<p>A resolution which had surprised herself had brought her into the</p>

<p>fields this week for the first time during many months.  After</p>

<p>wearing and wasting her palpitating heart with every engine of regret</p>

<p>that lonely inexperience could devise, common sense had illuminated</p>

<p>her.  She felt that she would do well to be useful again--to taste</p>

<p>anew sweet independence at any price.  The past was past; whatever</p>

<p>it had been, it was no more at hand.  Whatever its consequences,</p>

<p>time would close over them; they would all in a few years be as if</p>

<p>they had never been, and she herself grassed down and forgotten.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the trees were just as green as before; the birds sang and</p>

<p>the sun shone as clearly now as ever.  The familiar surroundings had</p>

<p>not darkened because of her grief, nor sickened because of her pain.</p>

<p>She might have seen that what had bowed her head so profoundly--the</p>

<p>thought of the world's concern at her situation--was founded on an</p>

<p>illusion.  She was not an existence, an experience, a passion, a</p>

<p>structure of sensations, to anybody but herself.  To all humankind</p>

<p>besides, Tess was only a passing thought.  Even to friends she was</p>

<p>no more than a frequently passing thought.  If she made herself</p>

<p>miserable the livelong night and day it was only this much to</p>

<p>them--"Ah, she makes herself unhappy."  If she tried to be cheerful,</p>

<p>to dismiss all care, to take pleasure in the daylight, the flowers,</p>

<p>the baby, she could only be this idea to them--"Ah, she bears it</p>

<p>very well."  Moreover, alone in a desert island would she have been</p>

<p>wretched at what had happened to her?  Not greatly.  If she could</p>

<p>have been but just created, to discover herself as a spouseless</p>

<p>mother, with no experience of life except as the parent of a nameless</p>

<p>child, would the position have caused her to despair?  No, she would</p>

<p>have taken it calmly, and found pleasure therein. Most of the misery</p>

<p>had been generated by her conventional aspect, and not by her innate</p>

<p>sensations.</p>

<p>Whatever Tess's reasoning, some spirit had induced her to dress</p>

<p>herself up neatly as she had formerly done, and come out into the</p>

<p>fields, harvest-hands being greatly in demand just then.  This was</p>

<p>why she had borne herself with dignity, and had looked people calmly</p>

<p>in the face at times, even when holding the baby in her arms.</p>

<p>The harvest-men rose from the shock of corn, and stretched their</p>

<p>limbs, and extinguished their pipes.  The horses, which had been</p>

<p>unharnessed and fed, were again attached to the scarlet machine.</p>

<p>Tess, having quickly eaten her own meal, beckoned to her eldest</p>

<p>sister to come and take away the baby, fastened her dress, put on</p>

<p>the buff gloves again, and stooped anew to draw a bond from the last</p>

<p>completed sheaf for the tying of the next.</p>

<p>In the afternoon and evening the proceedings of the morning were</p>

<p>continued, Tess staying on till dusk with the body of harvesters.</p>

<p>Then they all rode home in one of the largest wagons, in the company</p>

<p>of a broad tarnished moon that had risen from the ground to the</p>

<p>eastwards, its face resembling the outworn gold-leaf halo of some</p>

<p>worm-eaten Tuscan saint.  Tess's female companions sang songs, and</p>

<p>showed themselves very sympathetic and glad at her reappearance out</p>

<p>of doors, though they could not refrain from mischievously throwing</p>

<p>in a few verses of the ballad about the maid who went to the merry</p>

<p>green wood and came back a changed state.  There are counterpoises</p>

<p>and compensations in life; and the event which had made of her a</p>

<p>social warning had also for the moment made her the most interesting</p>

<p>personage in the village to many.  Their friendliness won her still</p>

<p>farther away from herself, their lively spirits were contagious, and</p>

<p>she became almost gay.</p>

<p>But now that her moral sorrows were passing away a fresh one arose on</p>

<p>the natural side of her which knew no social law.  When she reached</p>

<p>home it was to learn to her grief that the baby had been suddenly</p>

<p>taken ill since the afternoon.  Some such collapse had been probable,</p>

<p>so tender and puny was its frame; but the event came as a shock</p>

<p>nevertheless.</p>

<p>The baby's offence against society in coming into the world was</p>

<p>forgotten by the girl-mother; her soul's desire was to continue that</p>

<p>offence by preserving the life of the child.  However, it soon grew</p>

<p>clear that the hour of emancipation for that little prisoner of the</p>

<p>flesh was to arrive earlier than her worst misgiving had conjectured.</p>

<p>And when she had discovered this she was plunged into a misery which</p>

<p>transcended that of the child's simple loss.  Her baby had not been</p>

<p>baptized.</p>

<p>Tess had drifted into a frame of mind which accepted passively the</p>

<p>consideration that if she should have to burn for what she had done,</p>

<p>burn she must, and there was an end of it.  Like all village girls,</p>

<p>she was well grounded in the Holy Scriptures, and had dutifully</p>

<p>studied the histories of Aholah and Aholibah, and knew the inferences</p>

<p>to be drawn therefrom.  But when the same question arose with regard</p>

<p>to the baby, it had a very different colour.  Her darling was about</p>

<p>to die, and no salvation.</p>

<p>It was nearly bedtime, but she rushed downstairs and asked if she</p>

<p>might send for the parson.  The moment happened to be one at which</p>

<p>her father's sense of the antique nobility of his family was highest,</p>

<p>and his sensitiveness to the smudge which Tess had set upon that</p>

<p>nobility most pronounced, for he had just returned from his weekly</p>

<p>booze at Rolliver's Inn.  No parson should come inside his door, he</p>

<p>declared, prying into his affairs, just then, when, by her shame, it</p>

<p>had become more necessary than ever to hide them.  He locked the door</p>

<p>and put the key in his pocket.</p>

<p>The household went to bed, and, distressed beyond measure, Tess</p>

<p>retired also.  She was continually waking as she lay, and in the</p>

<p>middle of the night found that the baby was still worse.  It was</p>

<p>obviously dying--quietly and painlessly, but none the less surely.</p>

<p>In her misery she rocked herself upon the bed.  The clock struck the</p>

<p>solemn hour of one, that hour when fancy stalks outside reason, and</p>

<p>malignant possibilities stand rock-firm as facts.  She thought of</p>

<p>the child consigned to the nethermost corner of hell, as its double</p>

<p>doom for lack of baptism and lack of legitimacy; saw the arch-fiend</p>

<p>tossing it with his three-pronged fork, like the one they used for</p>

<p>heating the oven on baking days; to which picture she added many</p>

<p>other quaint and curious details of torment sometimes taught the</p>

<p>young in this Christian country.  The lurid presentment so powerfully</p>

<p>affected her imagination in the silence of the sleeping house that</p>

<p>her nightgown became damp with perspiration, and the bedstead shook</p>

<p>with each throb of her heart.</p>

<p>The infant's breathing grew more difficult, and the mother's mental</p>

<p>tension increased.  It was useless to devour the little thing with</p>

<p>kisses; she could stay in bed no longer, and walked feverishly about</p>

<p>the room.</p>

<p>"O merciful God, have pity; have pity upon my poor baby!" she cried.</p>

<p>"Heap as much anger as you want to upon me, and welcome; but pity the</p>

<p>child!"</p>

<p>She leant against the chest of drawers, and murmured incoherent</p>

<p>supplications for a long while, till she suddenly started up.</p>

<p>"Ah! perhaps baby can be saved!  Perhaps it will be just the same!"</p>

<p>She spoke so brightly that it seemed as though her face might have</p>

<p>shone in the gloom surrounding her.  She lit a candle, and went to</p>

<p>a second and a third bed under the wall, where she awoke her young</p>

<p>sisters and brothers, all of whom occupied the same room.  Pulling</p>

<p>out the washing-stand so that she could get behind it, she poured</p>

<p>some water from a jug, and made them kneel around, putting their</p>

<p>hands together with fingers exactly vertical.  While the children,</p>

<p>scarcely awake, awe-stricken at her manner, their eyes growing larger</p>

<p>and larger, remained in this position, she took the baby from her</p>

<p>bed--a child's child--so immature as scarce to seem a sufficient</p>

<p>personality to endow its producer with the maternal title.  Tess then</p>

<p>stood erect with the infant on her arm beside the basin; the next</p>

<p>sister held the Prayer-Book open before her, as the clerk at church</p>

<p>held it before the parson; and thus the girl set about baptizing her</p>

<p>child.</p>

<p>Her figure looked singularly tall and imposing as she stood in her</p>

<p>long white nightgown, a thick cable of twisted dark hair hanging</p>

<p>straight down her back to her waist.  The kindly dimness of the weak</p>

<p>candle abstracted from her form and features the little blemishes</p>

<p>which sunlight might have revealed--the stubble scratches upon her</p>

<p>wrists, and the weariness of her eyes--her high enthusiasm having</p>

<p>a transfiguring effect upon the face which had been her undoing,</p>

<p>showing it as a thing of immaculate beauty, with a touch of dignity</p>

<p>which was almost regal.  The little ones kneeling round, their sleepy</p>

<p>eyes blinking and red, awaited her preparations full of a suspended</p>

<p>wonder which their physical heaviness at that hour would not allow to</p>

<p>become active.</p>

<p>The most impressed of them said:</p>

<p>"Be you really going to christen him, Tess?"</p>

<p>The girl-mother replied in a grave affirmative.</p>

<p>"What's his name going to be?"</p>

<p>She had not thought of that, but a name suggested by a phrase in</p>

<p>the book of Genesis came into her head as she proceeded with the</p>

<p>baptismal service, and now she pronounced it:</p>

<p>"SORROW, I baptize thee in the name of the Father, and of the Son,</p>

<p>and of the Holy Ghost."</p>

<p>She sprinkled the water, and there was silence.</p>

<p>"Say 'Amen,' children."</p>

<p>The tiny voices piped in obedient response, "Amen!"</p>

<p>Tess went on:</p>

<p>"We receive this child"--and so forth--"and do sign him with the sign</p>

<p>of the Cross."</p>

<p>Here she dipped her hand into the basin, and fervently drew an</p>

<p>immense cross upon the baby with her forefinger, continuing with</p>

<p>the customary sentences as to his manfully fighting against sin,</p>

<p>the world, and the devil, and being a faithful soldier and servant</p>

<p>unto his life's end.  She duly went on with the Lord's Prayer, the</p>

<p>children lisping it after her in a thin gnat-like wail, till, at the</p>

<p>conclusion, raising their voices to clerk's pitch, they again piped</p>

<p>into silence, "Amen!"</p>

<p>Then their sister, with much augmented confidence in the efficacy</p>

<p>of the sacrament, poured forth from the bottom of her heart the</p>

<p>thanksgiving that follows, uttering it boldly and triumphantly in the</p>

<p>stopt-diapason note which her voice acquired when her heart was in</p>

<p>her speech, and which will never be forgotten by those who knew her.</p>

<p>The ecstasy of faith almost apotheosized her; it set upon her face a</p>

<p>glowing irradiation, and brought a red spot into the middle of each</p>

<p>cheek; while the miniature candle-flame inverted in her eye-pupils</p>

<p>shone like a diamond.  The children gazed up at her with more and</p>

<p>more reverence, and no longer had a will for questioning.  She did</p>

<p>not look like Sissy to them now, but as a being large, towering, and</p>

<p>awful--a divine personage with whom they had nothing in common.</p>

<p>Poor Sorrow's campaign against sin, the world, and the devil was</p>

<p>doomed to be of limited brilliancy--luckily perhaps for himself,</p>

<p>considering his beginnings.  In the blue of the morning that fragile</p>

<p>soldier and servant breathed his last, and when the other children</p>

<p>awoke they cried bitterly, and begged Sissy to have another pretty</p>

<p>baby.</p>

<p>The calmness which had possessed Tess since the christening remained</p>

<p>with her in the infant's loss.  In the daylight, indeed, she felt her</p>

<p>terrors about his soul to have been somewhat exaggerated; whether</p>

<p>well founded or not, she had no uneasiness now, reasoning that</p>

<p>if Providence would not ratify such an act of approximation</p>

<p>she, for one, did not value the kind of heaven lost by the</p>

<p>irregularity--either for herself or for her child.</p>

<p>So passed away Sorrow the Undesired--that intrusive creature, that</p>

<p>bastard gift of shameless Nature, who respects not the social law;</p>

<p>a waif to whom eternal Time had been a matter of days merely, who</p>

<p>knew not that such things as years and centuries ever were; to whom</p>

<p>the cottage interior was the universe, the week's weather climate,</p>

<p>new-born babyhood human existence, and the instinct to suck human</p>

<p>knowledge.</p>

<p>Tess, who mused on the christening a good deal, wondered if it were</p>

<p>doctrinally sufficient to secure a Christian burial for the child.</p>

<p>Nobody could tell this but the parson of the parish, and he was a</p>

<p>new-comer, and did not know her.  She went to his house after dusk,</p>

<p>and stood by the gate, but could not summon courage to go in.  The</p>

<p>enterprise would have been abandoned if she had not by accident met</p>

<p>him coming homeward as she turned away.  In the gloom she did not</p>

<p>mind speaking freely.</p>

<p>"I should like to ask you something, sir."</p>

<p>He expressed his willingness to listen, and she told the story of the</p>

<p>baby's illness and the extemporized ordinance.  "And now, sir," she</p>

<p>added earnestly, "can you tell me this--will it be just the same for</p>

<p>him as if you had baptized him?"</p>

<p>Having the natural feelings of a tradesman at finding that a job he</p>

<p>should have been called in for had been unskilfully botched by his</p>

<p>customers among themselves, he was disposed to say no.  Yet the</p>

<p>dignity of the girl, the strange tenderness in her voice, combined</p>

<p>to affect his nobler impulses--or rather those that he had left in</p>

<p>him after ten years of endeavour to graft technical belief on actual</p>

<p>scepticism.  The man and the ecclesiastic fought within him, and the</p>

<p>victory fell to the man.</p>

<p>"My dear girl," he said, "it will be just the same."</p>

<p>"Then will you give him a Christian burial?" she asked quickly.</p>

<p>The Vicar felt himself cornered. Hearing of the baby's illness, he</p>

<p>had conscientiously gone to the house after nightfall to perform the</p>

<p>rite, and, unaware that the refusal to admit him had come from Tess's</p>

<p>father and not from Tess, he could not allow the plea of necessity</p>

<p>for its irregular administration.</p>

<p>"Ah--that's another matter," he said.</p>

<p>"Another matter--why?" asked Tess, rather warmly.</p>

<p>"Well--I would willingly do so if only we two were concerned.  But I</p>

<p>must not--for certain reasons."</p>

<p>"Just for once, sir!"</p>

<p>"Really I must not."</p>

<p>"O sir!"  She seized his hand as she spoke.</p>

<p>He withdrew it, shaking his head.</p>

<p>"Then I don't like you!" she burst out, "and I'll never come to your</p>

<p>church no more!"</p>

<p>"Don't talk so rashly."</p>

<p>"Perhaps it will be just the same to him if you don't? ...  Will it</p>

<p>be just the same?  Don't for God's sake speak as saint to sinner, but</p>

<p>as you yourself to me myself--poor me!"</p>

<p>How the Vicar reconciled his answer with the strict notions he</p>

<p>supposed himself to hold on these subjects it is beyond a layman's</p>

<p>power to tell, though not to excuse.  Somewhat moved, he said in</p>

<p>this case also--</p>

<p>"It will be just the same."</p>

<p>So the baby was carried in a small deal box, under an ancient woman's</p>

<p>shawl, to the churchyard that night, and buried by lantern-light,</p>

<p>at the cost of a shilling and a pint of beer to the sexton, in that</p>

<p>shabby corner of God's allotment where He lets the nettles grow,</p>

<p>and where all unbaptized infants, notorious drunkards, suicides,</p>

<p>and others of the conjecturally damned are laid.  In spite of the</p>

<p>untoward surroundings, however, Tess bravely made a little cross of</p>

<p>two laths and a piece of string, and having bound it with flowers,</p>

<p>she stuck it up at the head of the grave one evening when she could</p>

<p>enter the churchyard without being seen, putting at the foot also</p>

<p>a bunch of the same flowers in a little jar of water to keep them</p>

<p>alive.  What matter was it that on the outside of the jar the eye of</p>

<p>mere observation noted the words "Keelwell's Marmalade"?  The eye of</p>

<p>maternal affection did not see them in its vision of higher things.</p>

<p>XV</p>

<p>"By experience," says Roger Ascham, "we find out a short way by</p>

<p>a long wandering."  Not seldom that long wandering unfits us for</p>

<p>further travel, and of what use is our experience to us then?  Tess</p>

<p>Durbeyfield's experience was of this incapacitating kind.  At last</p>

<p>she had learned what to do; but who would now accept her doing?</p>

<p>If before going to the d'Urbervilles' she had vigorously moved under</p>

<p>the guidance of sundry gnomic texts and phrases known to her and to</p>

<p>the world in general, no doubt she would never have been imposed on.</p>

<p>But it had not been in Tess's power--nor is it in anybody's power--to</p>

<p>feel the whole truth of golden opinions while it is possible to</p>

<p>profit by them.  She--and how many more--might have ironically said</p>

<p>to God with Saint Augustine: "Thou hast counselled a better course</p>

<p>than Thou hast permitted."</p>

<p>She remained at her father's house during the winter months, plucking</p>

<p>fowls, or cramming turkeys and geese, or making clothes for her</p>

<p>sisters and brothers out of some finery which d'Urberville had given</p>

<p>her, and she had put by with contempt.  Apply to him she would not.</p>

<p>But she would often clasp her hands behind her head and muse when she</p>

<p>was supposed to be working hard.</p>

<p>She philosophically noted dates as they came past in the revolution</p>

<p>of the year; the disastrous night of her undoing at Trantridge with</p>

<p>its dark background of The Chase; also the dates of the baby's birth</p>

<p>and death; also her own birthday; and every other day individualized</p>

<p>by incidents in which she had taken some share.  She suddenly thought</p>

<p>one afternoon, when looking in the glass at her fairness, that there</p>

<p>was yet another date, of greater importance to her than those; that</p>

<p>of her own death, when all these charms would have disappeared; a day</p>

<p>which lay sly and unseen among all the other days of the year, giving</p>

<p>no sign or sound when she annually passed over it; but not the less</p>

<p>surely there.  When was it?  Why did she not feel the chill of each</p>

<p>yearly encounter with such a cold relation?  She had Jeremy Taylor's</p>

<p>thought that some time in the future those who had known her would</p>

<p>say: "It is the ----th, the day that poor Tess Durbeyfield died"; and</p>

<p>there would be nothing singular to their minds in the statement.  Of</p>

<p>that day, doomed to be her terminus in time through all the ages, she</p>

<p>did not know the place in month, week, season or year.</p>

<p>Almost at a leap Tess thus changed from simple girl to complex woman.</p>

<p>Symbols of reflectiveness passed into her face, and a note of tragedy</p>

<p>at times into her voice.  Her eyes grew larger and more eloquent.</p>

<p>She became what would have been called a fine creature; her aspect</p>

<p>was fair and arresting; her soul that of a woman whom the turbulent</p>

<p>experiences of the last year or two had quite failed to demoralize.</p>

<p>But for the world's opinion those experiences would have been simply</p>

<p>a liberal education.</p>

<p>She had held so aloof of late that her trouble, never generally</p>

<p>known, was nearly forgotten in Marlott.  But it became evident to her</p>

<p>that she could never be really comfortable again in a place which</p>

<p>had seen the collapse of her family's attempt to "claim kin"--and,</p>

<p>through her, even closer union--with the rich d'Urbervilles.  At</p>

<p>least she could not be comfortable there till long years should have</p>

<p>obliterated her keen consciousness of it.  Yet even now Tess felt the</p>

<p>pulse of hopeful life still warm within her; she might be happy in</p>

<p>some nook which had no memories.  To escape the past and all that</p>

<p>appertained thereto was to annihilate it, and to do that she would</p>

<p>have to get away.</p>

<p>Was once lost always lost really true of chastity? she would ask</p>

<p>herself.  She might prove it false if she could veil bygones.  The</p>

<p>recuperative power which pervaded organic nature was surely not</p>

<p>denied to maidenhood alone.</p>

<p>She waited a long time without finding opportunity for a new</p>

<p>departure.  A particularly fine spring came round, and the stir of</p>

<p>germination was almost audible in the buds; it moved her, as it moved</p>

<p>the wild animals, and made her passionate to go.  At last, one day in</p>

<p>early May, a letter reached her from a former friend of her mother's,</p>

<p>to whom she had addressed inquiries long before--a person whom she</p>

<p>had never seen--that a skilful milkmaid was required at a dairy-house</p>

<p>many miles to the southward, and that the dairyman would be glad to</p>

<p>have her for the summer months.</p>

<p>It was not quite so far off as could have been wished; but it was</p>

<p>probably far enough, her radius of movement and repute having been</p>

<p>so small.  To persons of limited spheres, miles are as geographical</p>

<p>degrees, parishes as counties, counties as provinces and kingdoms.</p>

<p>On one point she was resolved: there should be no more d'Urberville</p>

<p>air-castles in the dreams and deeds of her new life.  She would be</p>

<p>the dairymaid Tess, and nothing more.  Her mother knew Tess's feeling</p>

<p>on this point so well, though no words had passed between them on the</p>

<p>subject, that she never alluded to the knightly ancestry now.</p>

<p>Yet such is human inconsistency that one of the interests of the</p>

<p>new place to her was the accidental virtues of its lying near her</p>

<p>forefathers' country (for they were not Blakemore men, though her</p>

<p>mother was Blakemore to the bone).  The dairy called Talbothays,</p>

<p>for which she was bound, stood not remotely from some of the former</p>

<p>estates of the d'Urbervilles, near the great family vaults of her</p>

<p>granddames and their powerful husbands.  She would be able to look at</p>

<p>them, and think not only that d'Urberville, like Babylon, had fallen,</p>

<p>but that the individual innocence of a humble descendant could lapse</p>

<p>as silently.  All the while she wondered if any strange good thing</p>

<p>might come of her being in her ancestral land; and some spirit within</p>

<p>her rose  automatically as the sap in the twigs.  It was unexpected</p>

<p>youth, surging up anew after its temporary check, and bringing with</p>

<p>it hope, and the invincible instinct towards self-delight.</p>

<p>END OF PHASE THE SECOND</p><empty-line /><p>Phase the Third: The Rally</p>

<p>XVI</p>

<p>On a thyme-scented, bird-hatching morning in May, between two and</p>

<p>three years after the return from Trantridge--silent, reconstructive</p>

<p>years for Tess Durbeyfield--she left her home for the second time.</p>

<p>Having packed up her luggage so that it could be sent to her later,</p>

<p>she started in a hired trap for the little town of Stourcastle,</p>

<p>through which it was necessary to pass on her journey, now in a</p>

<p>direction almost opposite to that of her first adventuring.  On the</p>

<p>curve of the nearest hill she looked back regretfully at Marlott and</p>

<p>her father's house, although she had been so anxious to get away.</p>

<p>Her kindred dwelling there would probably continue their daily</p>

<p>lives as heretofore, with no great diminution of pleasure in their</p>

<p>consciousness, although she would be far off, and they deprived of</p>

<p>her smile.  In a few days the children would engage in their games as</p>

<p>merrily as ever, without the sense of any gap left by her departure.</p>

<p>This leaving of the younger children she had decided to be for the</p>

<p>best; were she to remain they would probably gain less good by her</p>

<p>precepts than harm by her example.</p>

<p>She went through Stourcastle without pausing and onward to a junction</p>

<p>of highways, where she could await a carrier's van that ran to the</p>

<p>south-west; for the railways which engirdled this interior tract of</p>

<p>country had never yet struck across it.  While waiting, however,</p>

<p>there came along a farmer in his spring cart, driving approximately</p>

<p>in the direction that she wished to pursue.  Though he was a stranger</p>

<p>to her she accepted his offer of a seat beside him, ignoring that</p>

<p>its motive was a mere tribute to her countenance.  He was going to</p>

<p>Weatherbury, and by accompanying him thither she could walk the</p>

<p>remainder of the distance instead of travelling in the van by way of</p>

<p>Casterbridge.</p>

<p>Tess did not stop at Weatherbury, after this long drive, further than</p>

<p>to make a slight nondescript meal at noon at a cottage to which the</p>

<p>farmer recommended her.  Thence she started on foot, basket in hand,</p>

<p>to reach the wide upland of heath dividing this district from the</p>

<p>low-lying meads of a further valley in which the dairy stood that was</p>

<p>the aim and end of her day's pilgrimage.</p>

<p>Tess had never before visited this part of the country, and yet she</p>

<p>felt akin to the landscape.  Not so very far to the left of her she</p>

<p>could discern a dark patch in the scenery, which inquiry confirmed</p>

<p>her in supposing to be trees marking the environs of Kingsbere--in</p>

<p>the church of which parish the bones of her ancestors--her useless</p>

<p>ancestors--lay entombed.</p>

<p>She had no admiration for them now; she almost hated them for the</p>

<p>dance they had led her; not a thing of all that had been theirs did</p>

<p>she retain but the old seal and spoon.  "Pooh--I have as much of</p>

<p>mother as father in me!" she said.  "All my prettiness comes from</p>

<p>her, and she was only a dairymaid."</p>

<p>The journey over the intervening uplands and lowlands of Egdon,</p>

<p>when she reached them, was a more troublesome walk than she had</p>

<p>anticipated, the distance being actually but a few miles.  It was</p>

<p>two hours, owing to sundry wrong turnings, ere she found herself</p>

<p>on a summit commanding the long-sought-for vale, the Valley of the</p>

<p>Great Dairies, the valley in which milk and butter grew to rankness,</p>

<p>and were produced more profusely, if less delicately, than at her</p>

<p>home--the verdant plain so well watered by the river Var or Froom.</p>

<p>It was intrinsically different from the Vale of Little Dairies,</p>

<p>Blackmoor Vale, which, save during her disastrous sojourn at</p>

<p>Trantridge, she had exclusively known till now.  The world was drawn</p>

<p>to a larger pattern here.  The enclosures numbered fifty acres</p>

<p>instead of ten, the farmsteads were more extended, the groups of</p>

<p>cattle formed tribes hereabout; there only families.  These myriads</p>

<p>of cows stretching under her eyes from the far east to the far west</p>

<p>outnumbered any she had ever seen at one glance before. The green</p>

<p>lea was speckled as thickly with them as a canvas by Van Alsloot</p>

<p>or Sallaert with burghers.  The ripe hue of the red and dun kine</p>

<p>absorbed the evening sunlight, which the white-coated animals</p>

<p>returned to the eye in rays almost dazzling, even at the distant</p>

<p>elevation on which she stood.</p>

<p>The bird's-eye perspective before her was not so luxuriantly</p>

<p>beautiful, perhaps, as that other one which she knew so well; yet it</p>

<p>was more cheering.  It lacked the intensely blue atmosphere of the</p>

<p>rival vale, and its heavy soils and scents; the new air was clear,</p>

<p>bracing, ethereal.  The river itself, which nourished the grass</p>

<p>and cows of these renowned dairies, flowed not like the streams in</p>

<p>Blackmoor.  Those were slow, silent, often turbid; flowing over</p>

<p>beds of mud into which the incautious wader might sink and vanish</p>

<p>unawares.  The Froom waters were clear as the pure River of Life</p>

<p>shown to the Evangelist, rapid as the shadow of a cloud, with</p>

<p>pebbly shallows that prattled to the sky all day long.  There the</p>

<p>water-flower was the lily; the crow-foot here.</p>

<p>Either the change in the quality of the air from heavy to light, or</p>

<p>the sense of being amid new scenes where there were no invidious eyes</p>

<p>upon her, sent up her spirits wonderfully.  Her hopes mingled with</p>

<p>the sunshine in an ideal photosphere which surrounded her as she</p>

<p>bounded along against the soft south wind.  She heard a pleasant</p>

<p>voice in every breeze, and in every bird's note seemed to lurk a</p>

<p>joy.</p>

<p>Her face had latterly changed with changing states of mind,</p>

<p>continually fluctuating between beauty and ordinariness, according as</p>

<p>the thoughts were gay or grave.  One day she was pink and flawless;</p>

<p>another pale and tragical.  When she was pink she was feeling less</p>

<p>than when pale; her more perfect beauty accorded with her less</p>

<p>elevated mood; her more intense mood with her less perfect beauty.</p>

<p>It was her best face physically that was now set against the south</p>

<p>wind.</p>

<p>The irresistible, universal, automatic tendency to find sweet</p>

<p>pleasure somewhere, which pervades all life, from the meanest to the</p>

<p>highest, had at length mastered Tess.  Being even now only a young</p>

<p>woman of twenty, one who mentally and sentimentally had not finished</p>

<p>growing, it was impossible that any event should have left upon her</p>

<p>an impression that was not in time capable of transmutation.</p>

<p>And thus her spirits, and her thankfulness, and her hopes, rose</p>

<p>higher and higher.  She tried several ballads, but found them</p>

<p>inadequate; till, recollecting the psalter that her eyes had so often</p>

<p>wandered over of a Sunday morning before she had eaten of the tree</p>

<p>of knowledge, she chanted: "O ye Sun and Moon ... O ye Stars ... ye</p>

<p>Green Things upon the Earth ... ye Fowls of the Air ... Beasts and</p>

<p>Cattle ... Children of Men ... bless ye the Lord, praise Him and</p>

<p>magnify Him for ever!"</p>

<p>She suddenly stopped and murmured: "But perhaps I don't quite know</p>

<p>the Lord as yet."</p>

<p>And probably the half-unconscious rhapsody was a Fetishistic</p>

<p>utterance in a Monotheistic setting; women whose chief companions</p>

<p>are the forms and forces of outdoor Nature retain in their souls far</p>

<p>more of the Pagan fantasy of their remote forefathers than of the</p>

<p>systematized religion taught their race at later date.  However, Tess</p>

<p>found at least approximate expression for her feelings in the old</p>

<p>_Benedicite_ that she had lisped from infancy; and it was enough.</p>

<p>Such high contentment with such a slight initial performance as that</p>

<p>of having started towards a means of independent living was a part of</p>

<p>the Durbeyfield temperament.  Tess really wished to walk uprightly,</p>

<p>while her father did nothing of the kind; but she resembled him in</p>

<p>being content with immediate and small achievements, and in having no</p>

<p>mind for laborious effort towards such petty social advancement as</p>

<p>could alone be effected by a family so heavily handicapped as the</p>

<p>once powerful d'Urbervilles were now.</p>

<p>There was, it might be said, the energy of her mother's unexpended</p>

<p>family, as well as the natural energy of Tess's years, rekindled</p>

<p>after the experience which had so overwhelmed her for the time. Let</p>

<p>the truth be told--women do as a rule live through such humiliations,</p>

<p>and regain their spirits, and again look about them with an</p>

<p>interested eye.  While there's life there's hope is a conviction not</p>

<p>so entirely unknown to the "betrayed" as some amiable theorists would</p>

<p>have us believe.</p>

<p>Tess Durbeyfield, then, in good heart, and full of zest for life,</p>

<p>descended the Egdon slopes lower and lower towards the dairy of her</p>

<p>pilgrimage.</p>

<p>The marked difference, in the final particular, between the rival</p>

<p>vales now showed itself.  The secret of Blackmoor was best discovered</p>

<p>from the heights around; to read aright the valley before her it was</p>

<p>necessary to descend into its midst.  When Tess had accomplished this</p>

<p>feat she found herself to be standing on a carpeted level, which</p>

<p>stretched to the east and west as far as the eye could reach.</p>

<p>The river had stolen from the higher tracts and brought in particles</p>

<p>to the vale all this horizontal land; and now, exhausted, aged, and</p>

<p>attenuated, lay serpentining along through the midst of its former</p>

<p>spoils.</p>

<p>Not quite sure of her direction, Tess stood still upon the hemmed</p>

<p>expanse of verdant flatness, like a fly on a billiard-table of</p>

<p>indefinite length, and of no more consequence to the surroundings</p>

<p>than that fly.  The sole effect of her presence upon the placid</p>

<p>valley so far had been to excite the mind of a solitary heron, which,</p>

<p>after descending to the ground not far from her path, stood with neck</p>

<p>erect, looking at her.</p>

<p>Suddenly there arose from all parts of the lowland a prolonged and</p>

<p>repeated call--"Waow! waow! waow!"</p>

<p>From the furthest east to the furthest west the cries spread as if by</p>

<p>contagion, accompanied in some cases by the barking of a dog.  It was</p>

<p>not the expression of the valley's consciousness that beautiful Tess</p>

<p>had arrived, but the ordinary announcement of milking-time--half-past</p>

<p>four o'clock, when the dairymen set about getting in the cows.</p>

<p>The red and white herd nearest at hand, which had been phlegmatically</p>

<p>waiting for the call, now trooped towards the steading in the</p>

<p>background, their great bags of milk swinging under them as they</p>

<p>walked.  Tess followed slowly in their rear, and entered the barton</p>

<p>by the open gate through which they had entered before her.  Long</p>

<p>thatched sheds stretched round the enclosure, their slopes encrusted</p>

<p>with vivid green moss, and their eaves supported by wooden posts</p>

<p>rubbed to a glossy smoothness by the flanks of infinite cows</p>

<p>and calves of bygone years, now passed to an oblivion almost</p>

<p>inconceivable in its profundity.  Between the post were ranged</p>

<p>the milchers, each exhibiting herself at the present moment to a</p>

<p>whimsical eye in the rear as a circle on two stalks, down the centre</p>

<p>of which a switch moved pendulum-wise; while the sun, lowering itself</p>

<p>behind this patient row, threw their shadows accurately inwards upon</p>

<p>the wall.  Thus it threw shadows of these obscure and homely figures</p>

<p>every evening with as much care over each contour as if it had been</p>

<p>the profile of a court beauty on a palace wall; copied them as</p>

<p>diligently as it had copied Olympian shapes on marble _faзades_ long</p>

<p>ago, or the outline of Alexander, Caesar, and the Pharaohs.</p>

<p>They were the less restful cows that were stalled.  Those that would</p>

<p>stand still of their own will were milked in the middle of the yard,</p>

<p>where many of such better behaved ones stood waiting now--all prime</p>

<p>milchers, such as were seldom seen out of this valley, and not always</p>

<p>within it; nourished by the succulent feed which the water-meads</p>

<p>supplied at this prime season of the year.  Those of them that were</p>

<p>spotted with white reflected the sunshine in dazzling brilliancy,</p>

<p>and the polished brass knobs of their horns glittered with something</p>

<p>of military display.  Their large-veined udders hung ponderous as</p>

<p>sandbags, the teats sticking out like the legs of a gipsy's crock;</p>

<p>and as each animal lingered for her turn to arrive the milk oozed</p>

<p>forth and fell in drops to the ground.</p>

<p>XVII</p>

<p>The dairymaids and men had flocked down from their cottages and out</p>

<p>of the dairy-house with the arrival of the cows from the meads; the</p>

<p>maids walking in pattens, not on account of the weather, but to keep</p>

<p>their shoes above the mulch of the barton.  Each girl sat down on</p>

<p>her three-legged stool, her face sideways, her right cheek resting</p>

<p>against the cow, and looked musingly along the animal's flank at Tess</p>

<p>as she approached.  The male milkers, with hat-brims turned down,</p>

<p>resting flat on their foreheads and gazing on the ground, did not</p>

<p>observe her.</p>

<p>One of these was a sturdy middle-aged man--whose long white "pinner"</p>

<p>was somewhat finer and cleaner than the wraps of the others, and</p>

<p>whose jacket underneath had a presentable marketing aspect--the</p>

<p>master-dairyman, of whom she was in quest, his double character as</p>

<p>a working milker and butter maker here during six days, and on the</p>

<p>seventh as a man in shining broad-cloth in his family pew at church,</p>

<p>being so marked as to have inspired a rhyme:</p>

<p>             Dairyman Dick</p>

<p>             All the week:--</p>

<p>     On Sundays Mister Richard Crick.</p>

<p>Seeing Tess standing at gaze he went across to her.</p>

<p>The majority of dairymen have a cross manner at milking time, but it</p>

<p>happened that Mr Crick was glad to get a new hand--for the days were</p>

<p>busy ones now--and he received her warmly; inquiring for her mother</p>

<p>and the rest of the family--(though this as a matter of form merely,</p>

<p>for in reality he had not been aware of Mrs Durbeyfield's existence</p>

<p>till apprised of the fact by a brief business-letter about Tess).</p>

<p>"Oh--ay, as a lad I knowed your part o' the country very well," he</p>

<p>said terminatively.  "Though I've never been there since.  And a aged</p>

<p>woman of ninety that use to live nigh here, but is dead and gone long</p>

<p>ago, told me that a family of some such name as yours in Blackmoor</p>

<p>Vale came originally from these parts, and that 'twere a old ancient</p>

<p>race that had all but perished off the earth--though the new</p>

<p>generations didn't know it.  But, Lord, I took no notice of the old</p>

<p>woman's ramblings, not I."</p>

<p>"Oh no--it is nothing," said Tess.</p>

<p>Then the talk was of business only.</p>

<p>"You can milk 'em clean, my maidy? I don't want my cows going azew at</p>

<p>this time o' year."</p>

<p>She reassured him on that point, and he surveyed her up and down.</p>

<p>She had been staying indoors a good deal, and her complexion had</p>

<p>grown delicate.</p>

<p>"Quite sure you can stand it?  'Tis comfortable enough here for rough</p>

<p>folk; but we don't live in a cowcumber frame."</p>

<p>She declared that she could stand it, and her zest and willingness</p>

<p>seemed to win him over.</p>

<p>"Well, I suppose you'll want a dish o' tay, or victuals of some sort,</p>

<p>hey?  Not yet?  Well, do as ye like about it.  But faith, if 'twas I,</p>

<p>I should be as dry as a kex wi' travelling so far."</p>

<p>"I'll begin milking now, to get my hand in," said Tess.</p>

<p>She drank a little milk as temporary refreshment--to the</p>

<p>surprise--indeed, slight contempt--of Dairyman Crick, to whose mind</p>

<p>it had apparently never occurred that milk was good as a beverage.</p>

<p>"Oh, if ye can swaller that, be it so," he said indifferently, while</p>

<p>holding up the pail that she sipped from.  "'Tis what I hain't</p>

<p>touched for years--not I.  Rot the stuff; it would lie in my innerds</p>

<p>like lead.  You can try your hand upon she," he pursued, nodding to</p>

<p>the nearest cow.  "Not but what she do milk rather hard.  We've hard</p>

<p>ones and we've easy ones, like other folks.  However, you'll find out</p>

<p>that soon enough."</p>

<p>When Tess had changed her bonnet for a hood, and was really on her</p>

<p>stool under the cow, and the milk was squirting from her fists</p>

<p>into the pail, she appeared to feel that she really had laid a new</p>

<p>foundation for her future.  The conviction bred serenity, her pulse</p>

<p>slowed, and she was able to look about her.</p>

<p>The milkers formed quite a little battalion of men and maids, the</p>

<p>men operating on the hard-teated animals, the maids on the kindlier</p>

<p>natures.  It was a large dairy.  There were nearly a hundred</p>

<p>milchers under Crick's management, all told; and of the herd the</p>

<p>master-dairyman milked six or eight with his own hands, unless away</p>

<p>from home.  These were the cows that milked hardest of all; for his</p>

<p>journey-milkmen being more or less casually hired, he would not</p>

<p>entrust this half-dozen to their treatment, lest, from indifference,</p>

<p>they should not milk them fully; nor to the maids, lest they should</p>

<p>fail in the same way for lack of finger-grip; with the result that in</p>

<p>course of time the cows would "go azew"--that is, dry up.  It was not</p>

<p>the loss for the moment that made slack milking so serious, but that</p>

<p>with the decline of demand there came decline, and ultimately</p>

<p>cessation, of supply.</p>

<p>After Tess had settled down to her cow there was for a time no talk</p>

<p>in the barton, and not a sound interfered with the purr of the</p>

<p>milk-jets into the numerous pails, except a momentary exclamation</p>

<p>to one or other of the beasts requesting her to turn round or stand</p>

<p>still. The only movements were those of the milkers' hands up and</p>

<p>down, and the swing of the cows' tails.  Thus they all worked on,</p>

<p>encompassed by the vast flat mead which extended to either slope</p>

<p>of the valley--a level landscape compounded of old landscapes long</p>

<p>forgotten, and, no doubt, differing in character very greatly from</p>

<p>the landscape they composed now.</p>

<p>"To my thinking," said the dairyman, rising suddenly from a cow</p>

<p>he had just finished off, snatching up his three-legged stool in</p>

<p>one hand and the pail in the other, and moving on to the next</p>

<p>hard-yielder in his vicinity, "to my thinking, the cows don't gie</p>

<p>down their milk to-day as usual.  Upon my life, if Winker do begin</p>

<p>keeping back like this, she'll not be worth going under by</p>

<p>midsummer."</p>

<p>"'Tis because there's a new hand come among us," said Jonathan Kail.</p>

<p>"I've noticed such things afore."</p>

<p>"To be sure.  It may be so.  I didn't think o't."</p>

<p>"I've been told that it goes up into their horns at such times," said</p>

<p>a dairymaid.</p>

<p>"Well, as to going up into their horns," replied Dairyman Crick</p>

<p>dubiously, as though even witchcraft might be limited by anatomical</p>

<p>possibilities, "I couldn't say; I certainly could not.  But as nott</p>

<p>cows will keep it back as well as the horned ones, I don't quite</p>

<p>agree to it.  Do ye know that riddle about the nott cows, Jonathan?</p>

<p>Why do nott cows give less milk in a year than horned?"</p>

<p>"I don't!" interposed the milkmaid, "Why do they?"</p>

<p>"Because there bain't so many of 'em," said the dairyman.</p>

<p>"Howsomever, these gam'sters do certainly keep back their milk</p>

<p>to-day.  Folks, we must lift up a stave or two--that's the only cure</p>

<p>for't."</p>

<p>Songs were often resorted to in dairies hereabout as an enticement</p>

<p>to the cows when they showed signs of withholding their usual yield;</p>

<p>and the band of milkers at this request burst into melody--in purely</p>

<p>business-like tones, it is true, and with no great spontaneity; the</p>

<p>result, according to their own belief, being a decided improvement</p>

<p>during the song's continuance.  When they had gone through fourteen</p>

<p>or fifteen verses of a cheerful ballad about a murderer who was</p>

<p>afraid to go to bed in the dark because he saw certain brimstone</p>

<p>flames around him, one of the male milkers said--</p>

<p>"I wish singing on the stoop didn't use up so much of a man's wind!</p>

<p>You should get your harp, sir; not but what a fiddle is best."</p>

<p>Tess, who had given ear to this, thought the words were addressed to</p>

<p>the dairyman, but she was wrong.  A reply, in the shape of "Why?"</p>

<p>came as it were out of the belly of a dun cow in the stalls; it had</p>

<p>been spoken by a milker behind the animal, whom she had not hitherto</p>

<p>perceived.</p>

<p>"Oh yes; there's nothing like a fiddle," said the dairyman. "Though</p>

<p>I do think that bulls are more moved by a tune than cows--at least</p>

<p>that's my experience.  Once there was an old aged man over at</p>

<p>Mellstock--William Dewy by name--one of the family that used to do</p>

<p>a good deal of business as tranters over there--Jonathan, do ye</p>

<p>mind?--I knowed the man by sight as well as I know my own brother, in</p>

<p>a manner of speaking.  Well, this man was a coming home along from a</p>

<p>wedding, where he had been playing his fiddle, one fine moonlight</p>

<p>night, and for shortness' sake he took a cut across Forty-acres, a</p>

<p>field lying that way, where a bull was out to grass.  The bull seed</p>

<p>William, and took after him, horns aground, begad; and though William</p>

<p>runned his best, and hadn't MUCH drink in him (considering 'twas a</p>

<p>wedding, and the folks well off), he found he'd never reach the fence</p>

<p>and get over in time to save himself.  Well, as a last thought, he</p>

<p>pulled out his fiddle as he runned, and struck up a jig, turning to</p>

<p>the bull, and backing towards the corner.  The bull softened down,</p>

<p>and stood still, looking hard at William Dewy, who fiddled on and on;</p>

<p>till a sort of a smile stole over the bull's face.  But no sooner</p>

<p>did William stop his playing and turn to get over hedge than the</p>

<p>bull would stop his smiling and lower his horns towards the seat of</p>

<p>William's breeches.  Well, William had to turn about and play on,</p>

<p>willy-nilly; and 'twas only three o'clock in the world, and 'a knowed</p>

<p>that nobody would come that way for hours, and he so leery and tired</p>

<p>that 'a didn't know what to do.  When he had scraped till about four</p>

<p>o'clock he felt that he verily would have to give over soon, and he</p>

<p>said to himself, 'There's only this last tune between me and eternal</p>

<p>welfare! Heaven save me, or I'm a done man.'  Well, then he called to</p>

<p>mind how he'd seen the cattle kneel o' Christmas Eves in the dead o'</p>

<p>night.  It was not Christmas Eve then, but it came into his head to</p>

<p>play a trick upon the bull.  So he broke into the 'Tivity Hymm, just</p>

<p>as at Christmas carol-singing; when, lo and behold, down went the</p>

<p>bull on his bended knees, in his ignorance, just as if 'twere the</p>

<p>true 'Tivity night and hour.  As soon as his horned friend were down,</p>

<p>William turned, clinked off like a long-dog, and jumped safe over</p>

<p>hedge, before the praying bull had got on his feet again to take</p>

<p>after him.  William used to say that he'd seen a man look a fool</p>

<p>a good many times, but never such a fool as that bull looked when</p>

<p>he found his pious feelings had been played upon, and 'twas not</p>

<p>Christmas Eve. ...  Yes, William Dewy, that was the man's name; and</p>

<p>I can tell you to a foot where's he a-lying in Mellstock Churchyard</p>

<p>at this very moment--just between the second yew-tree and the north</p>

<p>aisle."</p>

<p>"It's a curious story; it carries us back to medieval times, when</p>

<p>faith was a living thing!"</p>

<p>The remark, singular for a dairy-yard, was murmured by the voice</p>

<p>behind the dun cow; but as nobody understood the reference, no notice</p>

<p>was taken, except that the narrator seemed to think it might imply</p>

<p>scepticism as to his tale.</p>

<p>"Well, 'tis quite true, sir, whether or no.  I knowed the man well."</p>

<p>"Oh yes; I have no doubt of it," said the person behind the dun cow.</p>

<p>Tess's attention was thus attracted to the dairyman's interlocutor,</p>

<p>of whom she could see but the merest patch, owing to his burying his</p>

<p>head so persistently in the flank of the milcher.  She could not</p>

<p>understand why he should be addressed as "sir" even by the dairyman</p>

<p>himself.  But no explanation was discernible; he remained under the</p>

<p>cow long enough to have milked three, uttering a private ejaculation</p>

<p>now and then, as if he could not get on.</p>

<p>"Take it gentle, sir; take it gentle," said the dairyman.  "'Tis</p>

<p>knack, not strength, that does it."</p>

<p>"So I find," said the other, standing up at last and stretching his</p>

<p>arms.  "I think I have finished her, however, though she made my</p>

<p>fingers ache."</p>

<p>Tess could then see him at full length.  He wore the ordinary white</p>

<p>pinner and leather leggings of a dairy-farmer when milking, and his</p>

<p>boots were clogged with the mulch of the yard; but this was all his</p>

<p>local livery.  Beneath it was something educated, reserved, subtle,</p>

<p>sad, differing.</p>

<p>But the details of his aspect were temporarily thrust aside by</p>

<p>the discovery that he was one whom she had seen before.  Such</p>

<p>vicissitudes had Tess passed through since that time that for a</p>

<p>moment she could not remember where she had met him; and then it</p>

<p>flashed upon her that he was the pedestrian who had joined in the</p>

<p>club-dance at Marlott--the passing stranger who had come she knew</p>

<p>not whence, had danced with others but not with her, and slightingly</p>

<p>left her, and gone on his way with his friends.</p>

<p>The flood of memories brought back by this revival of an incident</p>

<p>anterior to her troubles produced a momentary dismay lest,</p>

<p>recognizing her also, he should by some means discover her story.</p>

<p>But it passed away when she found no sign of remembrance in him.  She</p>

<p>saw by degrees that since their first and only encounter his mobile</p>

<p>face had grown more thoughtful, and had acquired a young man's</p>

<p>shapely moustache and beard--the latter of the palest straw colour</p>

<p>where it began upon his cheeks, and deepening to a warm brown farther</p>

<p>from its root.  Under his linen milking-pinner he wore a dark</p>

<p>velveteen jacket, cord breeches and gaiters, and a starched white</p>

<p>shirt.  Without the milking-gear nobody could have guessed what</p>

<p>he was.  He might with equal probability have been an eccentric</p>

<p>landowner or a gentlemanly ploughman.  That he was but a novice at</p>

<p>dairy work she had realized in a moment, from the time he had spent</p>

<p>upon the milking of one cow.</p>

<p>Meanwhile many of the milkmaids had said to one another of the</p>

<p>newcomer, "How pretty she is!" with something of real generosity and</p>

<p>admiration, though with a half hope that the auditors would qualify</p>

<p>the assertion--which, strictly speaking, they might have done,</p>

<p>prettiness being an inexact definition of what struck the eye in</p>

<p>Tess.  When the milking was finished for the evening they straggled</p>

<p>indoors, where Mrs Crick, the dairyman's wife--who was too</p>

<p>respectable to go out milking herself, and wore a hot stuff gown in</p>

<p>warm weather because the dairymaids wore prints--was giving an eye</p>

<p>to the leads and things.</p>

<p>Only two or three of the maids, Tess learnt, slept in the dairy-house</p>

<p>besides herself, most of the helpers going to their homes.  She saw</p>

<p>nothing at supper-time of the superior milker who had commented on</p>

<p>the story, and asked no questions about him, the remainder of the</p>

<p>evening being occupied in arranging her place in the bed-chamber.</p>

<p>It was a large room over the milk-house, some thirty feet long; the</p>

<p>sleeping-cots of the other three indoor milkmaids being in the same</p>

<p>apartment.  They were blooming young women, and, except one, rather</p>

<p>older than herself.  By bedtime Tess was thoroughly tired, and fell</p>

<p>asleep immediately.</p>

<p>But one of the girls, who occupied an adjoining bed, was more wakeful</p>

<p>than Tess, and would insist upon relating to the latter various</p>

<p>particulars of the homestead into which she had just entered.  The</p>

<p>girl's whispered words mingled with the shades, and, to Tess's drowsy</p>

<p>mind, they seemed to be generated by the darkness in which they</p>

<p>floated.</p>

<p>"Mr Angel Clare--he that is learning milking, and that plays</p>

<p>the harp--never says much to us.  He is a pa'son's son, and is</p>

<p>too much taken up wi' his own thoughts to notice girls.  He is</p>

<p>the dairyman's pupil--learning farming in all its branches.  He</p>

<p>has learnt sheep-farming at another place, and he's now mastering</p>

<p>dairy-work....  Yes, he is quite the gentleman-born.  His father is</p>

<p>the Reverent Mr Clare at Emminster--a good many miles from here."</p>

<p>"Oh--I have heard of him," said her companion, now awake.  "A very</p>

<p>earnest clergyman, is he not?"</p>

<p>"Yes--that he is--the earnestest man in all Wessex, they say--the</p>

<p>last of the old Low Church sort, they tell me--for all about here be</p>

<p>what they call High.  All his sons, except our Mr Clare, be made</p>

<p>pa'sons too."</p>

<p>Tess had not at this hour the curiosity to ask why the present Mr</p>

<p>Clare was not made a parson like his brethren, and gradually fell</p>

<p>asleep again, the words of her informant coming to her along with the</p>

<p>smell of the cheeses in the adjoining cheeseloft, and the measured</p>

<p>dripping of the whey from the wrings downstairs.</p>

<p>XVIII</p>

<p>Angel Clare rises out of the past not altogether as a distinct</p>

<p>figure, but as an appreciative voice, a long regard of fixed,</p>

<p>abstracted eyes, and a mobility of mouth somewhat too small and</p>

<p>delicately lined for a man's, though with an unexpectedly firm close</p>

<p>of the lower lip now and then; enough to do away with any inference</p>

<p>of indecision.  Nevertheless, something nebulous, preoccupied, vague,</p>

<p>in his bearing and regard, marked him as one who probably had no very</p>

<p>definite aim or concern about his material future.  Yet as a lad</p>

<p>people had said of him that he was one who might do anything if he</p>

<p>tried.</p>

<p>He was the youngest son of his father, a poor parson at the other end</p>

<p>of the county, and had arrived at Talbothays Dairy as a six months'</p>

<p>pupil, after going the round of some other farms, his object being</p>

<p>to acquire a practical skill in the various processes of farming,</p>

<p>with a view either to the Colonies or the tenure of a home-farm, as</p>

<p>circumstances might decide.</p>

<p>His entry into the ranks of the agriculturists and breeders was a</p>

<p>step in the young man's career which had been anticipated neither</p>

<p>by himself nor by others.</p>

<p>Mr Clare the elder, whose first wife had died and left him a</p>

<p>daughter, married a second late in life.  This lady had somewhat</p>

<p>unexpectedly brought him three sons, so that between Angel, the</p>

<p>youngest, and his father the Vicar there seemed to be almost a</p>

<p>missing generation.  Of these boys the aforesaid Angel, the child of</p>

<p>his old age, was the only son who had not taken a University degree,</p>

<p>though he was the single one of them whose early promise might have</p>

<p>done full justice to an academical training.</p>

<p>Some two or three years before Angel's appearance at the Marlott</p>

<p>dance, on a day when he had left school and was pursuing his studies</p>

<p>at home, a parcel came to the Vicarage from the local bookseller's,</p>

<p>directed to the Reverend James Clare.  The Vicar having opened it and</p>

<p>found it to contain a book, read a few pages; whereupon he jumped up</p>

<p>from his seat and went straight to the shop with the book under his</p>

<p>arm.</p>

<p>"Why has this been sent to my house?" he asked peremptorily, holding</p>

<p>up the volume.</p>

<p>"It was ordered, sir."</p>

<p>"Not by me, or any one belonging to me, I am happy to say."</p>

<p>The shopkeeper looked into his order-book.</p>

<p>"Oh, it has been misdirected, sir," he said.  "It was ordered by Mr</p>

<p>Angel Clare, and should have been sent to him."</p>

<p>Mr Clare winced as if he had been struck.  He went home pale and</p>

<p>dejected, and called Angel into his study.</p>

<p>"Look into this book, my boy," he said.  "What do you know about it?"</p>

<p>"I ordered it," said Angel simply.</p>

<p>"What for?"</p>

<p>"To read."</p>

<p>"How can you think of reading it?"</p>

<p>"How can I?  Why--it is a system of philosophy.  There is no more</p>

<p>moral, or even religious, work published."</p>

<p>"Yes--moral enough; I don't deny that.  But religious!--and for YOU,</p>

<p>who intend to be a minister of the Gospel!"</p>

<p>"Since you have alluded to the matter, father," said the son, with</p>

<p>anxious thought upon his face, "I should like to say, once for</p>

<p>all, that I should prefer not to take Orders.  I fear I could not</p>

<p>conscientiously do so.  I love the Church as one loves a parent.</p>

<p>I shall always have the warmest affection for her.  There is no</p>

<p>institution for whose history I have a deeper admiration; but I</p>

<p>cannot honestly be ordained her minister, as my brothers are, while</p>

<p>she refuses to liberate her mind from an untenable redemptive</p>

<p>theolatry."</p>

<p>It had never occurred to the straightforward and simple-minded Vicar</p>

<p>that one of his own flesh and blood could come to this!  He was</p>

<p>stultified, shocked, paralysed.  And if Angel were not going to</p>

<p>enter the Church, what was the use of sending him to Cambridge?  The</p>

<p>University as a step to anything but ordination seemed, to this man</p>

<p>of fixed ideas, a preface without a volume.  He was a man not merely</p>

<p>religious, but devout; a firm believer--not as the phrase is now</p>

<p>elusively construed by theological thimble-riggers in the Church and</p>

<p>out of it, but in the old and ardent sense of the Evangelical school:</p>

<p>one who could</p>

<p>              Indeed opine</p>

<p>        That the Eternal and Divine</p>

<p>        Did, eighteen centuries ago</p>

<p>        In very truth...</p>

<p>Angel's father tried argument, persuasion, entreaty.</p>

<p>"No, father; I cannot underwrite Article Four (leave alone the rest),</p>

<p>taking it 'in the literal and grammatical sense' as required by the</p>

<p>Declaration; and, therefore, I can't be a parson in the present state</p>

<p>of affairs," said Angel.  "My whole instinct in matters of religion</p>

<p>is towards reconstruction; to quote your favorite Epistle to the</p>

<p>Hebrews, 'the removing of those things that are shaken, as of things</p>

<p>that are made, that those things which cannot be shaken may remain.'"</p>

<p>His father grieved so deeply that it made Angel quite ill to see him.</p>

<p>"What is the good of your mother and me economizing and stinting</p>

<p>ourselves to give you a University education, if it is not to be used</p>

<p>for the honour and glory of God?" his father repeated.</p>

<p>"Why, that it may be used for the honour and glory of man, father."</p>

<p>Perhaps if Angel had persevered he might have gone to Cambridge like</p>

<p>his brothers.  But the Vicar's view of that seat of learning as a</p>

<p>stepping-stone to Orders alone was quite a family tradition; and so</p>

<p>rooted was the idea in his mind that perseverance began to appear to</p>

<p>the sensitive son akin to an intent to misappropriate a trust, and</p>

<p>wrong the pious heads of the household, who had been and were, as his</p>

<p>father had hinted, compelled to exercise much thrift to carry out</p>

<p>this uniform plan of education for the three young men.</p>

<p>"I will do without Cambridge," said Angel at last.  "I feel that I</p>

<p>have no right to go there in the circumstances."</p>

<p>The effects of this decisive debate were not long in showing</p>

<p>themselves.  He spent years and years in desultory studies,</p>

<p>undertakings, and meditations; he began to evince considerable</p>

<p>indifference to social forms and observances.  The material</p>

<p>distinctions of rank and wealth he increasingly despised.  Even the</p>

<p>"good old family" (to use a favourite phrase of a late local worthy)</p>

<p>had no aroma for him unless there were good new resolutions in its</p>

<p>representatives.  As a balance to these austerities, when he went to</p>

<p>live in London to see what the world was like, and with a view to</p>

<p>practising a profession or business there, he was carried off his</p>

<p>head, and nearly entrapped by a woman much older than himself, though</p>

<p>luckily he escaped not greatly the worse for the experience.</p>

<p>Early association with country solitudes had bred in him an</p>

<p>unconquerable, and almost unreasonable, aversion to modern town life,</p>

<p>and shut him out from such success as he might have aspired to by</p>

<p>following a mundane calling in the impracticability of the spiritual</p>

<p>one.  But something had to be done; he had wasted many valuable</p>

<p>years; and having an acquaintance who was starting on a thriving life</p>

<p>as a Colonial farmer, it occurred to Angel that this might be a lead</p>

<p>in the right direction.  Farming, either in the Colonies, America, or</p>

<p>at home--farming, at any rate, after becoming well qualified for the</p>

<p>business by a careful apprenticeship--that was a vocation which would</p>

<p>probably afford an independence without the sacrifice of what he</p>

<p>valued even more than a competency--intellectual liberty.</p>

<p>So we find Angel Clare at six-and-twenty here at Talbothays as a</p>

<p>student of kine, and, as there were no houses near at hand in which</p>

<p>he could get a comfortable lodging, a boarder at the dairyman's.</p>

<p>His room was an immense attic which ran the whole length of the</p>

<p>dairy-house.  It could only be reached by a ladder from the</p>

<p>cheese-loft, and had been closed up for a long time till he arrived</p>

<p>and selected it as his retreat.  Here Clare had plenty of space, and</p>

<p>could often be heard by the dairy-folk pacing up and down when the</p>

<p>household had gone to rest.  A portion was divided off at one end by</p>

<p>a curtain, behind which was his bed, the outer part being furnished</p>

<p>as a homely sitting-room.</p>

<p>At first he lived up above entirely, reading a good deal, and</p>

<p>strumming upon an old harp which he had bought at a sale, saying when</p>

<p>in a bitter humour that he might have to get his living by it in the</p>

<p>streets some day.  But he soon preferred to read human nature by</p>

<p>taking his meals downstairs in the general dining-kitchen, with the</p>

<p>dairyman and his wife, and the maids and men, who all together formed</p>

<p>a lively assembly; for though but few milking hands slept in the</p>

<p>house, several joined the family at meals.  The longer Clare resided</p>

<p>here the less objection had he to his company, and the more did he</p>

<p>like to share quarters with them in common.</p>

<p>Much to his surprise he took, indeed, a real delight in their</p>

<p>companionship.  The conventional farm-folk of his imagination--</p>

<p>personified in the newspaper-press by the pitiable dummy known as</p>

<p>Hodge--were obliterated after a few days' residence.  At close</p>

<p>quarters no Hodge was to be seen.  At first, it is true, when Clare's</p>

<p>intelligence was fresh from a contrasting society, these friends with</p>

<p>whom he now hobnobbed seemed a little strange.  Sitting down as a</p>

<p>level member of the dairyman's household seemed at the outset an</p>

<p>undignified proceeding.  The ideas, the modes, the surroundings,</p>

<p>appeared retrogressive and unmeaning.  But with living on there,</p>

<p>day after day, the acute sojourner became conscious of a new aspect</p>

<p>in the spectacle.  Without any objective change whatever, variety</p>

<p>had taken the place of monotonousness.  His host and his host's</p>

<p>household, his men and his maids, as they became intimately known to</p>

<p>Clare, began to differentiate themselves as in a chemical process.</p>

<p>The thought of Pascal's was brought home to him: "_A mesure qu'on a</p>

<p>plus d'esprit, on trouve qu'il y a plus d'hommes originaux.  Les</p>

<p>gens du commun ne trouvent pas de diffйrence entre les hommes._"</p>

<p>The typical and unvarying Hodge ceased to exist.  He had been</p>

<p>disintegrated into a number of varied fellow-creatures--beings of</p>

<p>many minds, beings infinite in difference; some happy, many serene, a</p>

<p>few depressed, one here and there bright even to genius, some stupid,</p>

<p>others wanton, others austere; some mutely Miltonic, some potentially</p>

<p>Cromwellian--into men who had private views of each other, as he had</p>

<p>of his friends; who could applaud or condemn each other, amuse or</p>

<p>sadden themselves by the contemplation of each other's foibles or</p>

<p>vices; men every one of whom walked in his own individual way the</p>

<p>road to dusty death.</p>

<p>Unexpectedly he began to like the outdoor life for its own sake,</p>

<p>and for what it brought, apart from its bearing on his own proposed</p>

<p>career.  Considering his position he became wonderfully free from the</p>

<p>chronic melancholy which is taking hold of the civilized races with</p>

<p>the decline of belief in a beneficent Power.  For the first time of</p>

<p>late years he could read as his musings inclined him, without any eye</p>

<p>to cramming for a profession, since the few farming handbooks which</p>

<p>he deemed it desirable to master occupied him but little time.</p>

<p>He grew away from old associations, and saw something new in life and</p>

<p>humanity.  Secondarily, he made close acquaintance with phenomena</p>

<p>which he had before known but darkly--the seasons in their moods,</p>

<p>morning and evening, night and noon, winds in their different</p>

<p>tempers, trees, waters and mists, shades and silences, and the voices</p>

<p>of inanimate things.</p>

<p>The early mornings were still sufficiently cool to render a fire</p>

<p>acceptable in the large room wherein they breakfasted; and, by</p>

<p>Mrs Crick's orders, who held that he was too genteel to mess at</p>

<p>their table, it was Angel Clare's custom to sit in the yawning</p>

<p>chimney-corner during the meal, his cup-and-saucer and plate being</p>

<p>placed on a hinged flap at his elbow.  The light from the long, wide,</p>

<p>mullioned window opposite shone in upon his nook, and, assisted by a</p>

<p>secondary light of cold blue quality which shone down the chimney,</p>

<p>enabled him to read there easily whenever disposed to do so.  Between</p>

<p>Clare and the window was the table at which his companions sat, their</p>

<p>munching profiles rising sharp against the panes; while to the side</p>

<p>was the milk-house door, through which were visible the rectangular</p>

<p>leads in rows, full to the brim with the morning's milk.  At the</p>

<p>further end the great churn could be seen revolving, and its</p>

<p>slip-slopping heard--the moving power being discernible through the</p>

<p>window in the form of a spiritless horse walking in a circle and</p>

<p>driven by a boy.</p>

<p>For several days after Tess's arrival Clare, sitting abstractedly</p>

<p>reading from some book, periodical, or piece of music just come by</p>

<p>post, hardly noticed that she was present at table.  She talked so</p>

<p>little, and the other maids talked so much, that the babble did not</p>

<p>strike him as possessing a new note, and he was ever in the habit</p>

<p>of neglecting the particulars of an outward scene for the general</p>

<p>impression.  One day, however, when he had been conning one of his</p>

<p>music-scores, and by force of imagination was hearing the tune in</p>

<p>his head, he lapsed into listlessness, and the music-sheet rolled</p>

<p>to the hearth.  He looked at the fire of logs, with its one flame</p>

<p>pirouetting on the top in a dying dance after the breakfast-cooking</p>

<p>and boiling, and it seemed to jig to his inward tune; also at the two</p>

<p>chimney crooks dangling down from the cotterel, or cross-bar, plumed</p>

<p>with soot, which quivered to the same melody; also at the half-empty</p>

<p>kettle whining an accompaniment.  The conversation at the table mixed</p>

<p>in with his phantasmal orchestra till he thought: "What a fluty voice</p>

<p>one of those milkmaids has!  I suppose it is the new one."</p>

<p>Clare looked round upon her, seated with the others.</p>

<p>She was not looking towards him.  Indeed, owing to his long silence,</p>

<p>his presence in the room was almost forgotten.</p>

<p>"I don't know about ghosts," she was saying; "but I do know that our</p>

<p>souls can be made to go outside our bodies when we are alive."</p>

<p>The dairyman turned to her with his mouth full, his eyes charged</p>

<p>with serious inquiry, and his great knife and fork (breakfasts were</p>

<p>breakfasts here) planted erect on the table, like the beginning of</p>

<p>a gallows.</p>

<p>"What--really now?  And is it so, maidy?" he said.</p>

<p>"A very easy way to feel 'em go," continued Tess, "is to lie on the</p>

<p>grass at night and look straight up at some big bright star; and, by</p>

<p>fixing your mind upon it, you will soon find that you are hundreds</p>

<p>and hundreds o' miles away from your body, which you don't seem to</p>

<p>want at all."</p>

<p>The dairyman removed his hard gaze from Tess, and fixed it on his</p>

<p>wife.</p>

<p>"Now that's a rum thing, Christianer--hey?  To think o' the miles</p>

<p>I've vamped o' starlight nights these last thirty year, courting, or</p>

<p>trading, or for doctor, or for nurse, and yet never had the least</p>

<p>notion o' that till now, or feeled my soul rise so much as an inch</p>

<p>above my shirt-collar."</p>

<p>The general attention being drawn to her, including that of the</p>

<p>dairyman's pupil, Tess flushed, and remarking evasively that it was</p>

<p>only a fancy, resumed her breakfast.</p>

<p>Clare continued to observe her.  She soon finished her eating, and</p>

<p>having a consciousness that Clare was regarding her, began to trace</p>

<p>imaginary patterns on the tablecloth with her forefinger with the</p>

<p>constraint of a domestic animal that perceives itself to be watched.</p>

<p>"What a fresh and virginal daughter of Nature that milkmaid is!" he</p>

<p>said to himself.</p>

<p>And then he seemed to discern in her something that was familiar,</p>

<p>something which carried him back into a joyous and unforeseeing past,</p>

<p>before the necessity of taking thought had made the heavens gray.  He</p>

<p>concluded that he had beheld her before; where he could not tell.  A</p>

<p>casual encounter during some country ramble it certainly had been,</p>

<p>and he was not greatly curious about it.  But the circumstance was</p>

<p>sufficient to lead him to select Tess in preference to the other</p>

<p>pretty milkmaids when he wished to contemplate contiguous womankind.</p>

<p>XIX</p>

<p>In general the cows were milked as they presented themselves, without</p>

<p>fancy or choice.  But certain cows will show a fondness for a</p>

<p>particular pair of hands, sometimes carrying this predilection so far</p>

<p>as to refuse to stand at all except to their favourite, the pail of a</p>

<p>stranger being unceremoniously kicked over.</p>

<p>It was Dairyman Crick's rule to insist on breaking down these</p>

<p>partialities and aversions by constant interchange, since otherwise,</p>

<p>in the event of a milkman or maid going away from the dairy, he was</p>

<p>placed in a difficulty.  The maids' private aims, however, were the</p>

<p>reverse of the dairyman's rule, the daily selection by each damsel of</p>

<p>the eight or ten cows to which she had grown accustomed rendering the</p>

<p>operation on their willing udders surprisingly easy and effortless.</p>

<p>Tess, like her compeers, soon discovered which of the cows had a</p>

<p>preference for her style of manipulation, and her fingers having</p>

<p>become delicate from the long domiciliary imprisonments to which</p>

<p>she had subjected herself at intervals during the last two or three</p>

<p>years, she would have been glad to meet the milchers' views in</p>

<p>this respect.  Out of the whole ninety-five there were eight in</p>

<p>particular--Dumpling, Fancy, Lofty, Mist, Old Pretty, Young Pretty,</p>

<p>Tidy, and Loud--who, though the teats of one or two were as hard as</p>

<p>carrots, gave down to her with a readiness that made her work on them</p>

<p>a mere touch of the fingers.  Knowing, however, the dairyman's wish,</p>

<p>she endeavoured conscientiously to take the animals just as they</p>

<p>came, expecting the very hard yielders which she could not yet</p>

<p>manage.</p>

<p>But she soon found a curious correspondence between the ostensibly</p>

<p>chance position of the cows and her wishes in this matter, till she</p>

<p>felt that their order could not be the result of accident.  The</p>

<p>dairyman's pupil had lent a hand in getting the cows together of</p>

<p>late, and at the fifth or sixth time she turned her eyes, as she</p>

<p>rested against the cow, full of sly inquiry upon him.</p>

<p>"Mr Clare, you have ranged the cows!" she said, blushing; and in</p>

<p>making the accusation, symptoms of a smile gently lifted her upper</p>

<p>lip in spite of her, so as to show the tips of her teeth, the lower</p>

<p>lip remaining severely still.</p>

<p>"Well, it makes no difference," said he.  "You will always be here to</p>

<p>milk them."</p>

<p>"Do you think so?  I HOPE I shall!  But I don't KNOW."</p>

<p>She was angry with herself afterwards, thinking that he, unaware of</p>

<p>her grave reasons for liking this seclusion, might have mistaken her</p>

<p>meaning.  She had spoken so earnestly to him, as if his presence</p>

<p>were somehow a factor in her wish.  Her misgiving was such that at</p>

<p>dusk, when the milking was over, she walked in the garden alone, to</p>

<p>continue her regrets that she had disclosed to him her discovery of</p>

<p>his considerateness.</p>

<p>It was a typical summer evening in June, the atmosphere being in</p>

<p>such delicate equilibrium and so transmissive that inanimate objects</p>

<p>seemed endowed with two or three senses, if not five.  There was no</p>

<p>distinction between the near and the far, and an auditor felt close</p>

<p>to everything within the horizon.  The soundlessness impressed her as</p>

<p>a positive entity rather than as the mere negation of noise.  It was</p>

<p>broken by the strumming of strings.</p>

<p>Tess had heard those notes in the attic above her head.  Dim,</p>

<p>flattened, constrained by their confinement, they had never appealed</p>

<p>to her as now, when they wandered in the still air with a stark</p>

<p>quality like that of nudity.  To speak absolutely, both instrument</p>

<p>and execution were poor; but the relative is all, and as she listened</p>

<p>Tess, like a fascinated bird, could not leave the spot.  Far from</p>

<p>leaving she drew up towards the performer, keeping behind the hedge</p>

<p>that he might not guess her presence.</p>

<p>The outskirt of the garden in which Tess found herself had been</p>

<p>left uncultivated for some years, and was now damp and rank with</p>

<p>juicy grass which sent up mists of pollen at a touch; and with tall</p>

<p>blooming weeds emitting offensive smells--weeds whose red and yellow</p>

<p>and purple hues formed a polychrome as dazzling as that of cultivated</p>

<p>flowers.  She went stealthily as a cat through this profusion of</p>

<p>growth, gathering cuckoo-spittle on her skirts, cracking snails that</p>

<p>were underfoot, staining her hands with thistle-milk and slug-slime,</p>

<p>and rubbing off upon her naked arms sticky blights which, though</p>

<p>snow-white on the apple-tree trunks, made madder stains on her skin;</p>

<p>thus she drew quite near to Clare, still unobserved of him.</p>

<p>Tess was conscious of neither time nor space.  The exaltation which</p>

<p>she had described as being producible at will by gazing at a star</p>

<p>came now without any determination of hers; she undulated upon the</p>

<p>thin notes of the second-hand harp, and their harmonies passed like</p>

<p>breezes through her, bringing tears into her eyes.  The floating</p>

<p>pollen seemed to be his notes made visible, and the dampness of</p>

<p>the garden the weeping of the garden's sensibility.  Though near</p>

<p>nightfall, the rank-smelling weed-flowers glowed as if they would not</p>

<p>close for intentness, and the waves of colour mixed with the waves of</p>

<p>sound.</p>

<p>The light which still shone was derived mainly from a large hole in</p>

<p>the western bank of cloud; it was like a piece of day left behind</p>

<p>by accident, dusk having closed in elsewhere.  He concluded his</p>

<p>plaintive melody, a very simple performance, demanding no great</p>

<p>skill; and she waited, thinking another might be begun.  But, tired</p>

<p>of playing, he had desultorily come round the fence, and was rambling</p>

<p>up behind her.  Tess, her cheeks on fire, moved away furtively, as if</p>

<p>hardly moving at all.</p>

<p>Angel, however, saw her light summer gown, and he spoke; his low</p>

<p>tones reaching her, though he was some distance off.</p>

<p>"What makes you draw off in that way, Tess?" said he.  "Are you</p>

<p>afraid?"</p>

<p>"Oh no, sir--not of outdoor things; especially just now when the</p>

<p>apple-blooth is falling, and everything is so green."</p>

<p>"But you have your indoor fears--eh?"</p>

<p>"Well--yes, sir."</p>

<p>"What of?"</p>

<p>"I couldn't quite say."</p>

<p>"The milk turning sour?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Life in general?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Ah--so have I, very often.  This hobble of being alive is rather</p>

<p>serious, don't you think so?"</p>

<p>"It is--now you put it that way."</p>

<p>"All the same, I shouldn't have expected a young girl like you to see</p>

<p>it so just yet.  How is it you do?"</p>

<p>She maintained a hesitating silence.</p>

<p>"Come, Tess, tell me in confidence."</p>

<p>She thought that he meant what were the aspects of things to her, and</p>

<p>replied shyly--</p>

<p>"The trees have inquisitive eyes, haven't they?--that is, seem as</p>

<p>if they had.  And the river says,--'Why do ye trouble me with your</p>

<p>looks?'  And you seem to see numbers of to-morrows just all in a</p>

<p>line, the first of them the biggest and clearest, the others getting</p>

<p>smaller and smaller as they stand farther away; but they all seem</p>

<p>very fierce and cruel and as if they said, 'I'm coming!  Beware of</p>

<p>me!  Beware of me!' ...  But YOU, sir, can raise up dreams with your</p>

<p>music, and drive all such horrid fancies away!"</p>

<p>He was surprised to find this young woman--who though but a milkmaid</p>

<p>had just that touch of rarity about her which might make her the</p>

<p>envied of her housemates--shaping such sad imaginings.  She was</p>

<p>expressing in her own native phrases--assisted a little by her Sixth</p>

<p>Standard training--feelings which might almost have been called those</p>

<p>of the age--the ache of modernism.  The perception arrested him less</p>

<p>when he reflected that what are called advanced ideas are really in</p>

<p>great part but the latest fashion in definition--a more accurate</p>

<p>expression, by words in _logy_ and _ism_, of sensations which men and</p>

<p>women have vaguely grasped for centuries.</p>

<p>Still, it was strange that they should have come to her while yet so</p>

<p>young; more than strange; it was impressive, interesting, pathetic.</p>

<p>Not guessing the cause, there was nothing to remind him that</p>

<p>experience is as to intensity, and not as to duration.  Tess's</p>

<p>passing corporeal blight had been her mental harvest.</p>

<p>Tess, on her part, could not understand why a man of clerical family</p>

<p>and good education, and above physical want, should look upon it as a</p>

<p>mishap to be alive.  For the unhappy pilgrim herself there was very</p>

<p>good reason.  But how could this admirable and poetic man ever have</p>

<p>descended into the Valley of Humiliation, have felt with the man of</p>

<p>Uz--as she herself had felt two or three years ago--"My soul chooseth</p>

<p>strangling and death rather than my life.  I loathe it; I would not</p>

<p>live alway."</p>

<p>It was true that he was at present out of his class.  But she knew</p>

<p>that was only because, like Peter the Great in a shipwright's yard,</p>

<p>he was studying what he wanted to know.  He did not milk cows because</p>

<p>he was obliged to milk cows, but because he was learning to be a</p>

<p>rich and prosperous dairyman, landowner, agriculturist, and breeder</p>

<p>of cattle.  He would become an American or Australian Abraham,</p>

<p>commanding like a monarch his flocks and his herds, his spotted</p>

<p>and his ring-straked, his men-servants and his maids.  At times,</p>

<p>nevertheless, it did seem unaccountable to her that a decidedly</p>

<p>bookish, musical, thinking young man should have chosen deliberately</p>

<p>to be a farmer, and not a clergyman, like his father and brothers.</p>

<p>Thus, neither having the clue to the other's secret, they were</p>

<p>respectively puzzled at what each revealed, and awaited new knowledge</p>

<p>of each other's character and mood without attempting to pry into</p>

<p>each other's history.</p>

<p>Every day, every hour, brought to him one more little stroke of</p>

<p>her nature, and to her one more of his.  Tess was trying to lead a</p>

<p>repressed life, but she little divined the strength of her own</p>

<p>vitality.</p>

<p>At first Tess seemed to regard Angel Clare as an intelligence rather</p>

<p>than as a man.  As such she compared him with herself; and at every</p>

<p>discovery of the abundance of his illuminations, of the distance</p>

<p>between her own modest mental standpoint and the unmeasurable, Andean</p>

<p>altitude of his, she became quite dejected, disheartened from all</p>

<p>further effort on her own part whatever.</p>

<p>He observed her dejection one day, when he had casually mentioned</p>

<p>something to her about pastoral life in ancient Greece.  She was</p>

<p>gathering the buds called "lords and ladies" from the bank while he</p>

<p>spoke.</p>

<p>"Why do you look so woebegone all of a sudden?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, 'tis only--about my own self," she said, with a frail laugh of</p>

<p>sadness, fitfully beginning to peel "a lady" meanwhile.  "Just a</p>

<p>sense of what might have been with me!  My life looks as if it had</p>

<p>been wasted for want of chances!  When I see what you know, what you</p>

<p>have read, and seen, and thought, I feel what a nothing I am!  I'm</p>

<p>like the poor Queen of Sheba who lived in the Bible.  There is no</p>

<p>more spirit in me."</p>

<p>"Bless my soul, don't go troubling about that!  Why," he said with</p>

<p>some enthusiasm, "I should be only too glad, my dear Tess, to help</p>

<p>you to anything in the way of history, or any line of reading you</p>

<p>would like to take up--"</p>

<p>"It is a lady again," interrupted she, holding out the bud she had</p>

<p>peeled.</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"I meant that there are always more ladies than lords when you come</p>

<p>to peel them."</p>

<p>"Never mind about the lords and ladies.  Would you like to take up</p>

<p>any course of study--history, for example?"</p>

<p>"Sometimes I feel I don't want to know anything more about it than I</p>

<p>know already."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"Because what's the use of learning that I am one of a long row</p>

<p>only--finding out that there is set down in some old book somebody</p>

<p>just like me, and to know that I shall only act her part; making me</p>

<p>sad, that's all.  The best is not to remember that your nature and</p>

<p>your past doings have been just like thousands' and thousands', and</p>

<p>that your coming life and doings 'll be like thousands's and</p>

<p>thousands'."</p>

<p>"What, really, then, you don't want to learn anything?"</p>

<p>"I shouldn't mind learning why--why the sun do shine on the just and</p>

<p>the unjust alike," she answered, with a slight quaver in her voice.</p>

<p>"But that's what books will not tell me."</p>

<p>"Tess, fie for such bitterness!"  Of course he spoke with a</p>

<p>conventional sense of duty only, for that sort of wondering had not</p>

<p>been unknown to himself in bygone days.  And as he looked at the</p>

<p>unpracticed mouth and lips, he thought that such a daughter of the</p>

<p>soil could only have caught up the sentiment by rote.  She went on</p>

<p>peeling the lords and ladies till Clare, regarding for a moment the</p>

<p>wave-like curl of her lashes as they dropped with her bent gaze on</p>

<p>her soft cheek, lingeringly went away.  When he was gone she stood</p>

<p>awhile, thoughtfully peeling the last bud; and then, awakening</p>

<p>from her reverie, flung it and all the crowd of floral nobility</p>

<p>impatiently on the ground, in an ebullition of displeasure with</p>

<p>herself for her _niaiserie_, and with a quickening warmth in her</p>

<p>heart of hearts.</p>

<p>How stupid he must think her!  In an access of hunger for his good</p>

<p>opinion she bethought herself of what she had latterly endeavoured to</p>

<p>forget, so unpleasant had been its issues--the identity of her family</p>

<p>with that of the knightly d'Urbervilles.  Barren attribute as it was,</p>

<p>disastrous as its discovery had been in many ways to her, perhaps</p>

<p>Mr Clare, as a gentleman and a student of history, would respect</p>

<p>her sufficiently to forget her childish conduct with the lords and</p>

<p>ladies if he knew that those Purbeck-marble and alabaster people in</p>

<p>Kingsbere Church really represented her own lineal forefathers; that</p>

<p>she was no spurious d'Urberville, compounded of money and ambition</p>

<p>like those at Trantridge, but true d'Urberville to the bone.</p>

<p>But, before venturing to make the revelation, dubious Tess indirectly</p>

<p>sounded the dairyman as to its possible effect upon Mr Clare, by</p>

<p>asking the former if Mr Clare had any great respect for old county</p>

<p>families when they had lost all their money and land.</p>

<p>"Mr Clare," said the dairyman emphatically, "is one of the most</p>

<p>rebellest rozums you ever knowed--not a bit like the rest of his</p>

<p>family; and if there's one thing that he do hate more than another</p>

<p>'tis the notion of what's called a' old family.  He says that it</p>

<p>stands to reason that old families have done their spurt of work in</p>

<p>past days, and can't have anything left in 'em now.  There's the</p>

<p>Billets and the Drenkhards and the Greys and the St Quintins and</p>

<p>the Hardys and the Goulds, who used to own the lands for miles down</p>

<p>this valley; you could buy 'em all up now for an old song a'most.</p>

<p>Why, our little Retty Priddle here, you know, is one of the</p>

<p>Paridelles--the old family that used to own lots o' the lands out by</p>

<p>King's Hintock, now owned by the Earl o' Wessex, afore even he or</p>

<p>his was heard of.  Well, Mr Clare found this out, and spoke quite</p>

<p>scornful to the poor girl for days.  'Ah!' he says to her, 'you'll</p>

<p>never make a good dairymaid!  All your skill was used up ages ago</p>

<p>in Palestine, and you must lie fallow for a thousand years to git</p>

<p>strength for more deeds!'  A boy came here t'other day asking for</p>

<p>a job, and said his name was Matt, and when we asked him his surname</p>

<p>he said he'd never heard that 'a had any surname, and when we asked</p>

<p>why, he said he supposed his folks hadn't been 'stablished long</p>

<p>enough.  'Ah! you're the very boy I want!' says Mr Clare, jumping</p>

<p>up and shaking hands wi'en; 'I've great hopes of you;' and gave him</p>

<p>half-a-crown.  O no! he can't stomach old families!"</p>

<p>After hearing this caricature of Clare's opinion poor Tess was glad</p>

<p>that she had not said a word in a weak moment about her family--even</p>

<p>though it was so unusually old almost to have gone round the circle</p>

<p>and become a new one.  Besides, another diary-girl was as good as</p>

<p>she, it seemed, in that respect.  She held her tongue about the</p>

<p>d'Urberville vault and the Knight of the Conqueror whose name she</p>

<p>bore.  The insight afforded into Clare's character suggested to her</p>

<p>that it was largely owing to her supposed untraditional newness that</p>

<p>she had won interest in his eyes.</p>

<p>XX</p>

<p>The season developed and matured.  Another year's instalment of</p>

<p>flowers, leaves, nightingales, thrushes, finches, and such ephemeral</p>

<p>creatures, took up their positions where only a year ago others had</p>

<p>stood in their place when these were nothing more than germs and</p>

<p>inorganic particles.  Rays from the sunrise drew forth the buds and</p>

<p>stretched them into long stalks, lifted up sap in noiseless streams,</p>

<p>opened petals, and sucked out scents in invisible jets and</p>

<p>breathings.</p>

<p>Dairyman Crick's household of maids and men lived on comfortably,</p>

<p>placidly, even merrily.  Their position was perhaps the happiest of</p>

<p>all positions in the social scale, being above the line at which</p>

<p>neediness ends, and below the line at which the _convenances_ begin</p>

<p>to cramp natural feelings, and the stress of threadbare modishness</p>

<p>makes too little of enough.</p>

<p>Thus passed the leafy time when arborescence seems to be the one</p>

<p>thing aimed at out of doors.  Tess and Clare unconsciously studied</p>

<p>each other, ever balanced on the edge of a passion, yet apparently</p>

<p>keeping out of it.  All the while they were converging, under an</p>

<p>irresistible law, as surely as two streams in one vale.</p>

<p>Tess had never in her recent life been so happy as she was now,</p>

<p>possibly never would be so happy again.  She was, for one thing,</p>

<p>physically and mentally suited among these new surroundings.  The</p>

<p>sapling which had rooted down to a poisonous stratum on the spot of</p>

<p>its sowing had been transplanted to a deeper soil.  Moreover she, and</p>

<p>Clare also, stood as yet on the debatable land between predilection</p>

<p>and love; where no profundities have been reached; no reflections</p>

<p>have set in, awkwardly inquiring, "Whither does this new current tend</p>

<p>to carry me?  What does it mean to my future?  How does it stand</p>

<p>towards my past?"</p>

<p>Tess was the merest stray phenomenon to Angel Clare as yet--a rosy,</p>

<p>warming apparition which had only just acquired the attribute of</p>

<p>persistence in his consciousness.  So he allowed his mind to be</p>

<p>occupied with her, deeming his preoccupation to be no more than a</p>

<p>philosopher's regard of an exceedingly novel, fresh, and interesting</p>

<p>specimen of womankind.</p>

<p>They met continually; they could not help it.  They met daily in that</p>

<p>strange and solemn interval, the twilight of the morning, in the</p>

<p>violet or pink dawn; for it was necessary to rise early, so very</p>

<p>early, here.  Milking was done betimes; and before the milking came</p>

<p>the skimming, which began at a little past three.  It usually fell</p>

<p>to the lot of some one or other of them to wake the rest, the first</p>

<p>being aroused by an alarm-clock; and, as Tess was the latest arrival,</p>

<p>and they soon discovered that she could be depended upon not to sleep</p>

<p>though the alarm as others did, this task was thrust most frequently</p>

<p>upon her.  No sooner had the hour of three struck and whizzed,</p>

<p>than she left her room and ran to the dairyman's door; then up the</p>

<p>ladder to Angel's, calling him in a loud whisper; then woke her</p>

<p>fellow-milkmaids.  By the time that Tess was dressed Clare was</p>

<p>downstairs and out in the humid air.  The remaining maids and the</p>

<p>dairyman usually gave themselves another turn on the pillow, and did</p>

<p>not appear till a quarter of an hour later.</p>

<p>The gray half-tones of daybreak are not the gray half-tones of the</p>

<p>day's close, though the degree of their shade may be the same.  In</p>

<p>the twilight of the morning, light seems active, darkness passive;</p>

<p>in the twilight of evening it is the darkness which is active and</p>

<p>crescent, and the light which is the drowsy reverse.</p>

<p>Being so often--possibly not always by chance--the first two persons</p>

<p>to get up at the dairy-house, they seemed to themselves the first</p>

<p>persons up of all the world.  In these early days of her residence</p>

<p>here Tess did not skim, but went out of doors at once after rising,</p>

<p>where he was generally awaiting her.  The spectral, half-compounded,</p>

<p>aqueous light which pervaded the open mead impressed them with</p>

<p>a feeling of isolation, as if they were Adam and Eve.  At this</p>

<p>dim inceptive stage of the day Tess seemed to Clare to exhibit a</p>

<p>dignified largeness both of disposition and physique, an almost</p>

<p>regnant power, possibly because he knew that at that preternatural</p>

<p>time hardly any woman so well endowed in person as she was likely to</p>

<p>be walking in the open air within the boundaries of his horizon; very</p>

<p>few in all England.  Fair women are usually asleep at mid-summer</p>

<p>dawns.  She was close at hand, and the rest were nowhere.</p>

<p>The mixed, singular, luminous gloom in which they walked along</p>

<p>together to the spot where the cows lay often made him think of the</p>

<p>Resurrection hour.  He little thought that the Magdalen might be</p>

<p>at his side.  Whilst all the landscape was in neutral shade his</p>

<p>companion's face, which was the focus of his eyes, rising above the</p>

<p>mist stratum, seemed to have a sort of phosphorescence upon it.  She</p>

<p>looked ghostly, as if she were merely a soul at large.  In reality</p>

<p>her face, without appearing to do so, had caught the cold gleam of</p>

<p>day from the north-east; his own face, though he did not think of</p>

<p>it, wore the same aspect to her.</p>

<p>It was then, as has been said, that she impressed him most deeply.</p>

<p>She was no longer the milkmaid, but a visionary essence of woman--a</p>

<p>whole sex condensed into one typical form.  He called her Artemis,</p>

<p>Demeter, and other fanciful names half teasingly, which she did not</p>

<p>like because she did not understand them.</p>

<p>"Call me Tess," she would say askance; and he did.</p>

<p>Then it would grow lighter, and her features would become simply</p>

<p>feminine; they had changed from those of a divinity who could confer</p>

<p>bliss to those of a being who craved it.</p>

<p>At these non-human hours they could get quite close to the waterfowl.</p>

<p>Herons came, with a great bold noise as of opening doors and</p>

<p>shutters, out of the boughs of a plantation which they frequented at</p>

<p>the side of the mead; or, if already on the spot, hardily maintained</p>

<p>their standing in the water as the pair walked by, watching them by</p>

<p>moving their heads round in a slow, horizontal, passionless wheel,</p>

<p>like the turn of puppets by clockwork.</p>

<p>They could then see the faint summer fogs in layers, woolly, level,</p>

<p>and apparently no thicker than counterpanes, spread about the meadows</p>

<p>in detached remnants of small extent.  On the gray moisture of the</p>

<p>grass were marks where the cows had lain through the night--dark-green</p>

<p>islands of dry herbage the size of their carcasses, in the general</p>

<p>sea of dew. From each island proceeded a serpentine trail, by which</p>

<p>the cow had rambled away to feed after getting up, at the end of</p>

<p>which trail they found her; the snoring puff from her nostrils, when</p>

<p>she recognized them, making an intenser little fog of her own amid</p>

<p>the prevailing one.  Then they drove the animals back to the barton,</p>

<p>or sat down to milk them on the spot, as the case might require.</p>

<p>Or perhaps the summer fog was more general, and the meadows lay like</p>

<p>a white sea, out of which the scattered trees rose like dangerous</p>

<p>rocks.  Birds would soar through it into the upper radiance, and</p>

<p>hang on the wing sunning themselves, or alight on the wet rails</p>

<p>subdividing the mead, which now shone like glass rods.  Minute</p>

<p>diamonds of moisture from the mist hung, too, upon Tess's eyelashes,</p>

<p>and drops upon her hair, like seed pearls.  When the day grew quite</p>

<p>strong and commonplace these dried off her; moreover, Tess then</p>

<p>lost her strange and ethereal beauty; her teeth, lips, and eyes</p>

<p>scintillated in the sunbeams and she was again the dazzlingly fair</p>

<p>dairymaid only, who had to hold her own against the other women of</p>

<p>the world.</p>

<p>About this time they would hear Dairyman Crick's voice, lecturing the</p>

<p>non-resident milkers for arriving late, and speaking sharply to old</p>

<p>Deborah Fyander for not washing her hands.</p>

<p>"For Heaven's sake, pop thy hands under the pump, Deb!  Upon my soul,</p>

<p>if the London folk only knowed of thee and thy slovenly ways, they'd</p>

<p>swaller their milk and butter more mincing than they do a'ready; and</p>

<p>that's saying a good deal."</p>

<p>The milking progressed, till towards the end Tess and Clare, in</p>

<p>common with the rest, could hear the heavy breakfast table dragged</p>

<p>out from the wall in the kitchen by Mrs Crick, this being the</p>

<p>invariable preliminary to each meal; the same horrible scrape</p>

<p>accompanying its return journey when the table had been cleared.</p>

<p>XXI</p>

<p>There was a great stir in the milk-house just after breakfast.  The</p>

<p>churn revolved as usual, but the butter would not come.  Whenever</p>

<p>this happened the dairy was paralyzed.  Squish, squash echoed the</p>

<p>milk in the great cylinder, but never arose the sound they waited</p>

<p>for.</p>

<p>Dairyman Crick and his wife, the milkmaids Tess, Marian, Retty</p>

<p>Priddle, Izz Huett, and the married ones from the cottages; also</p>

<p>Mr Clare, Jonathan Kail, old Deborah, and the rest, stood gazing</p>

<p>hopelessly at the churn; and the boy who kept the horse going outside</p>

<p>put on moon-like eyes to show his sense of the situation.  Even the</p>

<p>melancholy horse himself seemed to look in at the window in inquiring</p>

<p>despair at each walk round.</p>

<p>"'Tis years since I went to Conjuror Trendle's son in Egdon--years!"</p>

<p>said the dairyman bitterly.  "And he was nothing to what his father</p>

<p>had been.  I have said fifty times, if I have said once, that I DON'T</p>

<p>believe in en; though 'a do cast folks' waters very true.  But I</p>

<p>shall have to go to 'n if he's alive.  O yes, I shall have to go to</p>

<p>'n, if this sort of thing continnys!"</p>

<p>Even Mr Clare began to feel tragical at the dairyman's desperation.</p>

<p>"Conjuror Fall, t'other side of Casterbridge, that they used to call</p>

<p>'Wide-O', was a very good man when I was a boy," said Jonathan Kail.</p>

<p>"But he's rotten as touchwood by now."</p>

<p>"My grandfather used to go to Conjuror Mynterne, out at Owlscombe,</p>

<p>and a clever man a' were, so I've heard grandf'er say," continued Mr</p>

<p>Crick.  "But there's no such genuine folk about nowadays!"</p>

<p>Mrs Crick's mind kept nearer to the matter in hand.</p>

<p>"Perhaps somebody in the house is in love," she said tentatively.</p>

<p>"I've heard tell in my younger days that that will cause it.  Why,</p>

<p>Crick--that maid we had years ago, do ye mind, and how the butter</p>

<p>didn't come then--"</p>

<p>"Ah yes, yes!--but that isn't the rights o't.  It had nothing to do</p>

<p>with the love-making.  I can mind all about it--'twas the damage to</p>

<p>the churn."</p>

<p>He turned to Clare.</p>

<p>"Jack Dollop, a 'hore's-bird of a fellow we had here as milker at one</p>

<p>time, sir, courted a young woman over at Mellstock, and deceived her</p>

<p>as he had deceived many afore.  But he had another sort o' woman to</p>

<p>reckon wi' this time, and it was not the girl herself.  One Holy</p>

<p>Thursday of all days in the almanack, we was here as we mid be now,</p>

<p>only there was no churning in hand, when we zid the girl's mother</p>

<p>coming up to the door, wi' a great brass-mounted umbrella in her</p>

<p>hand that would ha' felled an ox, and saying 'Do Jack Dollop work</p>

<p>here?--because I want him!  I have a big bone to pick with he, I</p>

<p>can assure 'n!'  And some way behind her mother walked Jack's young</p>

<p>woman, crying bitterly into her handkercher.  'O Lard, here's a</p>

<p>time!' said Jack, looking out o' winder at 'em.  'She'll murder me!</p>

<p>Where shall I get--where shall I--?  Don't tell her where I be!'</p>

<p>And with that he scrambled into the churn through the trap-door, and</p>

<p>shut himself inside, just as the young woman's mother busted into</p>

<p>the milk-house.  'The villain--where is he?' says she.  'I'll claw</p>

<p>his face for'n, let me only catch him!'  Well, she hunted about</p>

<p>everywhere, ballyragging Jack by side and by seam, Jack lying</p>

<p>a'most stifled inside the churn, and the poor maid--or young woman</p>

<p>rather--standing at the door crying her eyes out.  I shall never</p>

<p>forget it, never! 'Twould have melted a marble stone!  But she</p>

<p>couldn't find him nowhere at all."</p>

<p>The dairyman paused, and one or two words of comment came from the</p>

<p>listeners.</p>

<p>Dairyman Crick's stories often seemed to be ended when they were not</p>

<p>really so, and strangers were betrayed into premature interjections</p>

<p>of finality; though old friends knew better.  The narrator went on--</p>

<p>"Well, how the old woman should have had the wit to guess it I could</p>

<p>never tell, but she found out that he was inside that there churn.</p>

<p>Without saying a word she took hold of the winch (it was turned by</p>

<p>handpower then), and round she swung him, and Jack began to flop</p>

<p>about inside.  'O Lard! stop the churn! let me out!' says he, popping</p>

<p>out his head.  'I shall be churned into a pummy!'  (He was a cowardly</p>

<p>chap in his heart, as such men mostly be).  'Not till ye make amends</p>

<p>for ravaging her virgin innocence!' says the old woman.  'Stop the</p>

<p>churn you old witch!' screams he.  'You call me old witch, do ye, you</p>

<p>deceiver!' says she, 'when ye ought to ha' been calling me mother-law</p>

<p>these last five months!'  And on went the churn, and Jack's bones</p>

<p>rattled round again.  Well, none of us ventured to interfere; and at</p>

<p>last 'a promised to make it right wi' her.  'Yes--I'll be as good as</p>

<p>my word!' he said.  And so it ended that day."</p>

<p>While the listeners were smiling their comments there was a</p>

<p>quick movement behind their backs, and they looked round.  Tess,</p>

<p>pale-faced, had gone to the door.</p>

<p>"How warm 'tis to-day!" she said, almost inaudibly.</p>

<p>It was warm, and none of them connected her withdrawal with the</p>

<p>reminiscences of the dairyman.  He went forward and opened the door</p>

<p>for her, saying with tender raillery--</p>

<p>"Why, maidy" (he frequently, with unconscious irony, gave her this</p>

<p>pet name), "the prettiest milker I've got in my dairy; you mustn't</p>

<p>get so fagged as this at the first breath of summer weather, or we</p>

<p>shall be finely put to for want of 'ee by dog-days, shan't we, Mr</p>

<p>Clare?"</p>

<p>"I was faint--and--I think I am better out o' doors," she said</p>

<p>mechanically; and disappeared outside.</p>

<p>Fortunately for her the milk in the revolving churn at that moment</p>

<p>changed its squashing for a decided flick-flack.</p>

<p>"'Tis coming!" cried Mrs Crick, and the attention of all was called</p>

<p>off from Tess.</p>

<p>That fair sufferer soon recovered herself externally; but she</p>

<p>remained much depressed all the afternoon. When the evening milking</p>

<p>was done she did not care to be with the rest of them, and went out</p>

<p>of doors, wandering along she knew not whither.  She was wretched--O</p>

<p>so wretched--at the perception that to her companions the dairyman's</p>

<p>story had been rather a humorous narration than otherwise; none of</p>

<p>them but herself seemed to see the sorrow of it; to a certainty, not</p>

<p>one knew how cruelly it touched the tender place in her experience.</p>

<p>The evening sun was now ugly to her, like a great inflamed wound in</p>

<p>the sky.  Only a solitary cracked-voice reed-sparrow greeted her from</p>

<p>the bushes by the river, in a sad, machine-made tone, resembling that</p>

<p>of a past friend whose friendship she had outworn.</p>

<p>In these long June days the milkmaids, and, indeed, most of the</p>

<p>household, went to bed at sunset or sooner, the morning work before</p>

<p>milking being so early and heavy at a time of full pails.  Tess</p>

<p>usually accompanied her fellows upstairs.  To-night, however, she was</p>

<p>the first to go to their common chamber; and she had dozed when the</p>

<p>other girls came in.  She saw them undressing in the orange light</p>

<p>of the vanished sun, which flushed their forms with its colour; she</p>

<p>dozed again, but she was reawakened by their voices, and quietly</p>

<p>turned her eyes towards them.</p>

<p>Neither of her three chamber-companions had got into bed.  They were</p>

<p>standing in a group, in their nightgowns, barefooted, at the window,</p>

<p>the last red rays of the west still warming their faces and necks and</p>

<p>the walls around them.  All were watching somebody in the garden with</p>

<p>deep interest, their three faces close together: a jovial and round</p>

<p>one, a pale one with dark hair, and a fair one whose tresses were</p>

<p>auburn.</p>

<p>"Don't push!  You can see as well as I," said Retty, the</p>

<p>auburn-haired and youngest girl, without removing her eyes from the</p>

<p>window.</p>

<p>"'Tis no use for you to be in love with him any more than me, Retty</p>

<p>Priddle," said jolly-faced Marian, the eldest, slily.  "His thoughts</p>

<p>be of other cheeks than thine!"</p>

<p>Retty Priddle still looked, and the others looked again.</p>

<p>"There he is again!" cried Izz Huett, the pale girl with dark damp</p>

<p>hair and keenly cut lips.</p>

<p>"You needn't say anything, Izz," answered Retty.  "For I zid you</p>

<p>kissing his shade."</p>

<p>"WHAT did you see her doing?" asked Marian.</p>

<p>"Why--he was standing over the whey-tub to let off the whey, and the</p>

<p>shade of his face came upon the wall behind, close to Izz, who was</p>

<p>standing there filling a vat.  She put her mouth against the wall and</p>

<p>kissed the shade of his mouth; I zid her, though he didn't."</p>

<p>"O Izz Huett!" said Marian.</p>

<p>A rosy spot came into the middle of Izz Huett's cheek.</p>

<p>"Well, there was no harm in it," she declared, with attempted</p>

<p>coolness.  "And if I be in love wi'en, so is Retty, too; and so be</p>

<p>you, Marian, come to that."</p>

<p>Marian's full face could not blush past its chronic pinkness.</p>

<p>"I!" she said.  "What a tale!  Ah, there he is again!  Dear</p>

<p>eyes--dear face--dear Mr Clare!"</p>

<p>"There--you've owned it!"</p>

<p>"So have you--so have we all," said Marian, with the dry frankness of</p>

<p>complete indifference to opinion.  "It is silly to pretend otherwise</p>

<p>amongst ourselves, though we need not own it to other folks.  I would</p>

<p>just marry 'n to-morrow!"</p>

<p>"So would I--and more," murmured Izz Huett.</p>

<p>"And I too," whispered the more timid Retty.</p>

<p>The listener grew warm.</p>

<p>"We can't all marry him," said Izz.</p>

<p>"We shan't, either of us; which is worse still," said the eldest.</p>

<p>"There he is again!"</p>

<p>They all three blew him a silent kiss.</p>

<p>"Why?" asked Retty quickly.</p>

<p>"Because he likes Tess Durbeyfield best," said Marian, lowering her</p>

<p>voice.  "I have watched him every day, and have found it out."</p>

<p>There was a reflective silence.</p>

<p>"But she don't care anything for 'n?" at length breathed Retty.</p>

<p>"Well--I sometimes think that too."</p>

<p>"But how silly all this is!" said Izz Huett impatiently.  "Of course</p>

<p>he won't marry any one of us, or Tess either--a gentleman's son,</p>

<p>who's going to be a great landowner and farmer abroad!  More likely</p>

<p>to ask us to come wi'en as farm-hands at so much a year!"</p>

<p>One sighed, and another sighed, and Marian's plump figure sighed</p>

<p>biggest of all.  Somebody in bed hard by sighed too.  Tears came into</p>

<p>the eyes of Retty Priddle, the pretty red-haired youngest--the last</p>

<p>bud of the Paridelles, so important in the county annals.  They</p>

<p>watched silently a little longer, their three faces still close</p>

<p>together as before, and the triple hues of their hair mingling.  But</p>

<p>the unconscious Mr Clare had gone indoors, and they saw him no more;</p>

<p>and, the shades beginning to deepen, they crept into their beds.</p>

<p>In a few minutes they heard him ascend the ladder to his own room.</p>

<p>Marian was soon snoring, but Izz did not drop into forgetfulness for</p>

<p>a long time.  Retty Priddle cried herself to sleep.</p>

<p>The deeper-passioned Tess was very far from sleeping even then.  This</p>

<p>conversation was another of the bitter pills she had been obliged to</p>

<p>swallow that day.  Scarce the least feeling of jealousy arose in her</p>

<p>breast.  For that matter she knew herself to have the preference.</p>

<p>Being more finely formed, better educated, and, though the youngest</p>

<p>except Retty, more woman than either, she perceived that only the</p>

<p>slightest ordinary care was necessary for holding her own in Angel</p>

<p>Clare's heart against these her candid friends.  But the grave</p>

<p>question was, ought she to do this?  There was, to be sure, hardly a</p>

<p>ghost of a chance for either of them, in a serious sense; but there</p>

<p>was, or had been, a chance of one or the other inspiring him with a</p>

<p>passing fancy for her, and enjoying the pleasure of his attentions</p>

<p>while he stayed here.  Such unequal attachments had led to marriage;</p>

<p>and she had heard from Mrs Crick that Mr Clare had one day asked, in</p>

<p>a laughing way, what would be the use of his marrying a fine lady,</p>

<p>and all the while ten thousand acres of Colonial pasture to feed,</p>

<p>and cattle to rear, and corn to reap.  A farm-woman would be the</p>

<p>only sensible kind of wife for him.  But whether Mr Clare had spoken</p>

<p>seriously or not, why should she, who could never conscientiously</p>

<p>allow any man to marry her now, and who had religiously determined</p>

<p>that she never would be tempted to do so, draw off Mr Clare's</p>

<p>attention from other women, for the brief happiness of sunning</p>

<p>herself in his eyes while he remained at Talbothays?</p>

<p>XXII</p>

<p>They came downstairs yawning next morning; but skimming and milking</p>

<p>were proceeded with as usual, and they went indoors to breakfast.</p>

<p>Dairyman Crick was discovered stamping about the house.  He had</p>

<p>received a letter, in which a customer had complained that the butter</p>

<p>had a twang.</p>

<p>"And begad, so 't have!" said the dairyman, who held in his left hand</p>

<p>a wooden slice on which a lump of butter was stuck. "Yes--taste for</p>

<p>yourself!"</p>

<p>Several of them gathered round him; and Mr Clare tasted, Tess tasted,</p>

<p>also the other indoor milkmaids, one or two of the milking-men, and</p>

<p>last of all Mrs Crick, who came out from the waiting breakfast-table.</p>

<p>There certainly was a twang.</p>

<p>The dairyman, who had thrown himself into abstraction to better</p>

<p>realize the taste, and so divine the particular species of noxious</p>

<p>weed to which it appertained, suddenly exclaimed--</p>

<p>"'Tis garlic! and I thought there wasn't a blade left in that mead!"</p>

<p>Then all the old hands remembered that a certain dry mead, into which</p>

<p>a few of the cows had been admitted of late, had, in years gone by,</p>

<p>spoilt the butter in the same way.  The dairyman had not recognized</p>

<p>the taste at that time, and thought the butter bewitched.</p>

<p>"We must overhaul that mead," he resumed; "this mustn't continny!"</p>

<p>All having armed themselves with old pointed knives, they went out</p>

<p>together.  As the inimical plant could only be present in very</p>

<p>microscopic dimensions to have escaped ordinary observation, to</p>

<p>find it seemed rather a hopeless attempt in the stretch of rich</p>

<p>grass before them.  However, they formed themselves into line, all</p>

<p>assisting, owing to the importance of the search; the dairyman at</p>

<p>the upper end with Mr Clare, who had volunteered to help; then</p>

<p>Tess, Marian, Izz Huett, and Retty; then Bill Lewell, Jonathan, and</p>

<p>the married dairywomen--Beck Knibbs, with her wooly black hair and</p>

<p>rolling eyes; and flaxen Frances, consumptive from the winter damps</p>

<p>of the water-meads--who lived in their respective cottages.</p>

<p>With eyes fixed upon the ground they crept slowly across a strip of</p>

<p>the field, returning a little further down in such a manner that,</p>

<p>when they should have finished, not a single inch of the pasture but</p>

<p>would have fallen under the eye of some one of them.  It was a most</p>

<p>tedious business, not more than half a dozen shoots of garlic being</p>

<p>discoverable in the whole field; yet such was the herb's pungency</p>

<p>that probably one bite of it by one cow had been sufficient to season</p>

<p>the whole dairy's produce for the day.</p>

<p>Differing one from another in natures and moods so greatly as they</p>

<p>did, they yet formed, bending, a curiously uniform row--automatic,</p>

<p>noiseless; and an alien observer passing down the neighbouring lane</p>

<p>might well have been excused for massing them as "Hodge".  As they</p>

<p>crept along, stooping low to discern the plant, a soft yellow gleam</p>

<p>was reflected from the buttercups into their shaded faces, giving</p>

<p>them an elfish, moonlit aspect, though the sun was pouring upon their</p>

<p>backs in all the strength of noon.</p>

<p>Angel Clare, who communistically stuck to his rule of taking part</p>

<p>with the rest in everything, glanced up now and then.  It was not,</p>

<p>of course, by accident that he walked next to Tess.</p>

<p>"Well, how are you?" he murmured.</p>

<p>"Very well, thank you, sir," she replied demurely.</p>

<p>As they had been discussing a score of personal matters only</p>

<p>half-an-hour before, the introductory style seemed a little</p>

<p>superfluous.  But they got no further in speech just then.  They</p>

<p>crept and crept, the hem of her petticoat just touching his gaiter,</p>

<p>and his elbow sometimes brushing hers.  At last the dairyman, who</p>

<p>came next, could stand it no longer.</p>

<p>"Upon my soul and body, this here stooping do fairly make my back</p>

<p>open and shut!" he exclaimed, straightening himself slowly with an</p>

<p>excruciated look till quite upright.  "And you, maidy Tess, you</p>

<p>wasn't well a day or two ago--this will make your head ache finely!</p>

<p>Don't do any more, if you feel fainty; leave the rest to finish it."</p>

<p>Dairyman Crick withdrew, and Tess dropped behind.  Mr Clare also</p>

<p>stepped out of line, and began privateering about for the weed.  When</p>

<p>she found him near her, her very tension at what she had heard the</p>

<p>night before made her the first to speak.</p>

<p>"Don't they look pretty?" she said.</p>

<p>"Who?"</p>

<p>"Izzy Huett and Retty."</p>

<p>Tess had moodily decided that either of these maidens would make a</p>

<p>good farmer's wife, and that she ought to recommend them, and obscure</p>

<p>her own wretched charms.</p>

<p>"Pretty?  Well, yes--they are pretty girls--fresh looking.  I have</p>

<p>often thought so."</p>

<p>"Though, poor dears, prettiness won't last long!"</p>

<p>"O no, unfortunately."</p>

<p>"They are excellent dairywomen."</p>

<p>"Yes: though not better than you."</p>

<p>"They skim better than I."</p>

<p>"Do they?"</p>

<p>Clare remained observing them--not without their observing him.</p>

<p>"She is colouring up," continued Tess heroically.</p>

<p>"Who?"</p>

<p>"Retty Priddle."</p>

<p>"Oh!  Why it that?"</p>

<p>"Because you are looking at her."</p>

<p>Self-sacrificing as her mood might be, Tess could not well go further</p>

<p>and cry, "Marry one of them, if you really do want a dairywoman and</p>

<p>not a lady; and don't think of marrying me!"  She followed Dairyman</p>

<p>Crick, and had the mournful satisfaction of seeing that Clare</p>

<p>remained behind.</p>

<p>From this day she forced herself to take pains to avoid him--never</p>

<p>allowing herself, as formerly, to remain long in his company, even if</p>

<p>their juxtaposition were purely accidental.  She gave the other three</p>

<p>every chance.</p>

<p>Tess was woman enough to realize from their avowals to herself that</p>

<p>Angel Clare had the honour of all the dairymaids in his keeping, and</p>

<p>her perception of his care to avoid compromising the happiness of</p>

<p>either in the least degree bred a tender respect in Tess for what she</p>

<p>deemed, rightly or wrongly, the self-controlling sense of duty shown</p>

<p>by him, a quality which she had never expected to find in one of the</p>

<p>opposite sex, and in the absence of which more than one of the simple</p>

<p>hearts who were his house-mates might have gone weeping on her</p>

<p>pilgrimage.</p>

<p>XXIII</p>

<p>The hot weather of July had crept upon them unawares, and the</p>

<p>atmosphere of the flat vale hung heavy as an opiate over the</p>

<p>dairy-folk, the cows, and the trees.  Hot steaming rains fell</p>

<p>frequently, making the grass where the cows fed yet more rank, and</p>

<p>hindering the late hay-making in the other meads.</p>

<p>It was Sunday morning; the milking was done; the outdoor milkers</p>

<p>had gone home.  Tess and the other three were dressing themselves</p>

<p>rapidly, the whole bevy having agreed to go together to Mellstock</p>

<p>Church, which lay some three or four miles distant from the</p>

<p>dairy-house.  She had now been two months at Talbothays, and this</p>

<p>was her first excursion.</p>

<p>All the preceding afternoon and night heavy thunderstorms had hissed</p>

<p>down upon the meads, and washed some of the hay into the river; but</p>

<p>this morning the sun shone out all the more brilliantly for the</p>

<p>deluge, and the air was balmy and clear.</p>

<p>The crooked lane leading from their own parish to Mellstock ran along</p>

<p>the lowest levels in a portion of its length, and when the girls</p>

<p>reached the most depressed spot they found that the result of the</p>

<p>rain had been to flood the lane over-shoe to a distance of some fifty</p>

<p>yards.  This would have been no serious hindrance on a week-day; they</p>

<p>would have clicked through it in their high patterns and boots quite</p>

<p>unconcerned; but on this day of vanity, this Sun's-day, when flesh</p>

<p>went forth to coquet with flesh while hypocritically affecting</p>

<p>business with spiritual things; on this occasion for wearing their</p>

<p>white stockings and thin shoes, and their pink, white, and lilac</p>

<p>gowns, on which every mud spot would be visible, the pool was an</p>

<p>awkward impediment.  They could hear the church-bell calling--as yet</p>

<p>nearly a mile off.</p>

<p>"Who would have expected such a rise in the river in summer-time!"</p>

<p>said Marian, from the top of the roadside bank on which they had</p>

<p>climbed, and were maintaining a precarious footing in the hope of</p>

<p>creeping along its slope till they were past the pool.</p>

<p>"We can't get there anyhow, without walking right through it, or else</p>

<p>going round the Turnpike way; and that would make us so very late!"</p>

<p>said Retty, pausing hopelessly.</p>

<p>"And I do colour up so hot, walking into church late, and all the</p>

<p>people staring round," said Marian, "that I hardly cool down again</p>

<p>till we get into the That-it-may-please-Thees."</p>

<p>While they stood clinging to the bank they heard a splashing round</p>

<p>the bend of the road, and presently appeared Angel Clare, advancing</p>

<p>along the lane towards them through the water.</p>

<p>Four hearts gave a big throb simultaneously.</p>

<p>His aspect was probably as un-Sabbatarian a one as a dogmatic</p>

<p>parson's son often presented; his attire being his dairy clothes,</p>

<p>long wading boots, a cabbage-leaf inside his hat to keep his head</p>

<p>cool, with a thistle-spud to finish him off.  "He's not going to</p>

<p>church," said Marian.</p>

<p>"No--I wish he was!" murmured Tess.</p>

<p>Angel, in fact, rightly or wrongly (to adopt the safe phrase of</p>

<p>evasive controversialists), preferred sermons in stones to sermons in</p>

<p>churches and chapels on fine summer days.  This morning, moreover,</p>

<p>he had gone out to see if the damage to the hay by the flood was</p>

<p>considerable or not.  On his walk he observed the girls from a long</p>

<p>distance, though they had been so occupied with their difficulties of</p>

<p>passage as not to notice him.  He knew that the water had risen at</p>

<p>that spot, and that it would quite check their progress.  So he had</p>

<p>hastened on, with a dim idea of how he could help them--one of them</p>

<p>in particular.</p>

<p>The rosy-cheeked, bright-eyed quartet looked so charming in their</p>

<p>light summer attire, clinging to the roadside bank like pigeons on a</p>

<p>roof-slope, that he stopped a moment to regard them before coming</p>

<p>close.  Their gauzy skirts had brushed up from the grass innumerable</p>

<p>flies and butterflies which, unable to escape, remained caged in</p>

<p>the transparent tissue as in an aviary.  Angel's eye at last fell</p>

<p>upon Tess, the hindmost of the four; she, being full of suppressed</p>

<p>laughter at their dilemma, could not help meeting his glance</p>

<p>radiantly.</p>

<p>He came beneath them in the water, which did not rise over his long</p>

<p>boots; and stood looking at the entrapped flies and butterflies.</p>

<p>"Are you trying to get to church?" he said to Marian, who was in</p>

<p>front, including the next two in his remark, but avoiding Tess.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; and 'tis getting late; and my colour do come up so--"</p>

<p>"I'll carry you through the pool--every Jill of you."</p>

<p>The whole four flushed as if one heart beat through them.</p>

<p>"I think you can't, sir," said Marian.</p>

<p>"It is the only way for you to get past.  Stand still.  Nonsense--you</p>

<p>are not too heavy!  I'd carry you all four together.  Now, Marian,</p>

<p>attend," he continued, "and put your arms round my shoulders, so.</p>

<p>Now!  Hold on. That's well done."</p>

<p>Marian had lowered herself upon his arm and shoulder as directed, and</p>

<p>Angel strode off with her, his slim figure, as viewed from behind,</p>

<p>looking like the mere stem to the great nosegay suggested by hers.</p>

<p>They disappeared round the curve of the road, and only his sousing</p>

<p>footsteps and the top ribbon of Marian's bonnet told where they were.</p>

<p>In a few minutes he reappeared.  Izz Huett was the next in order upon</p>

<p>the bank.</p>

<p>"Here he comes," she murmured, and they could hear that her lips were</p>

<p>dry with emotion.  "And I have to put my arms round his neck and look</p>

<p>into his face as Marian did."</p>

<p>"There's nothing in that," said Tess quickly.</p>

<p>"There's a time for everything," continued Izz, unheeding.  "A time</p>

<p>to embrace, and a time to refrain from embracing; the first is now</p>

<p>going to be mine."</p>

<p>"Fie--it is Scripture, Izz!"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Izz, "I've always a' ear at church for pretty verses."</p>

<p>Angel Clare, to whom three-quarters of this performance was a</p>

<p>commonplace act of kindness, now approached Izz.  She quietly and</p>

<p>dreamily lowered herself into his arms, and Angel methodically</p>

<p>marched off with her.  When he was heard returning for the third time</p>

<p>Retty's throbbing heart could be almost seen to shake her.  He went</p>

<p>up to the red-haired girl, and while he was seizing her he glanced at</p>

<p>Tess.  His lips could not have pronounced more plainly, "It will soon</p>

<p>be you and I."  Her comprehension appeared in her face; she could not</p>

<p>help it.  There was an understanding between them.</p>

<p>Poor little Retty, though by far the lightest weight, was the most</p>

<p>troublesome of Clare's burdens.  Marian had been like a sack of meal,</p>

<p>a dead weight of plumpness under which he has literally staggered.</p>

<p>Izz had ridden sensibly and calmly.  Retty was a bunch of hysterics.</p>

<p>However, he got through with the disquieted creature, deposited her,</p>

<p>and returned.  Tess could see over the hedge the distant three in a</p>

<p>group, standing as he had placed them on the next rising ground.  It</p>

<p>was now her turn.  She was embarrassed to discover that excitement at</p>

<p>the proximity of Mr Clare's breath and eyes, which she had contemned</p>

<p>in her companions, was intensified in herself; and as if fearful of</p>

<p>betraying her secret, she paltered with him at the last moment.</p>

<p>"I may be able to clim' along the bank perhaps--I can clim' better</p>

<p>than they.  You must be so tired, Mr Clare!"</p>

<p>"No, no, Tess," said he quickly.  And almost before she was aware,</p>

<p>she was seated in his arms and resting against his shoulder.</p>

<p>"Three Leahs to get one Rachel," he whispered.</p>

<p>"They are better women than I," she replied, magnanimously sticking</p>

<p>to her resolve.</p>

<p>"Not to me," said Angel.</p>

<p>He saw her grow warm at this; and they went some steps in silence.</p>

<p>"I hope I am not too heavy?" she said timidly.</p>

<p>"O no.  You should lift Marian!  Such a lump.  You are like an</p>

<p>undulating billow warmed by the sun.  And all this fluff of muslin</p>

<p>about you is the froth."</p>

<p>"It is very pretty--if I seem like that to you."</p>

<p>"Do you know that I have undergone three-quarters of this labour</p>

<p>entirely for the sake of the fourth quarter?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"I did not expect such an event to-day."</p>

<p>"Nor I...  The water came up so sudden."</p>

<p>That the rise in the water was what she understood him to refer to,</p>

<p>the state of breathing belied.  Clare stood still and inclinced his</p>

<p>face towards hers.</p>

<p>"O Tessy!" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>The girl's cheeks burned to the breeze, and she could not look into</p>

<p>his eyes for her emotion.  It reminded Angel that he was somewhat</p>

<p>unfairly taking advantage of an accidental position; and he went no</p>

<p>further with it.  No definite words of love had crossed their lips</p>

<p>as yet, and suspension at this point was desirable now. However,</p>

<p>he walked slowly, to make the remainder of the distance as long as</p>

<p>possible; but at last they came to the bend, and the rest of their</p>

<p>progress was in full view of the other three.  The dry land was</p>

<p>reached, and he set her down.</p>

<p>Her friends were looking with round thoughtful eyes at her and him,</p>

<p>and she could see that they had been talking of her.  He hastily bade</p>

<p>them farewell, and splashed back along the stretch of submerged road.</p>

<p>The four moved on together as before, till Marian broke the silence</p>

<p>by saying--</p>

<p>"No--in all truth; we have no chance against her!"  She looked</p>

<p>joylessly at Tess.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" asked the latter.</p>

<p>"He likes 'ee best--the very best!  We could see it as he brought</p>

<p>'ee.  He would have kissed 'ee, if you had encouraged him to do it,</p>

<p>ever so little."</p>

<p>"No, no," said she.</p>

<p>The gaiety with which they had set out had somehow vanished; and</p>

<p>yet there was no enmity or malice between them.  They were generous</p>

<p>young souls; they had been reared in the lonely country nooks where</p>

<p>fatalism is a strong sentiment, and they did not blame her.  Such</p>

<p>supplanting was to be.</p>

<p>Tess's heart ached.  There was no concealing from herself the fact</p>

<p>that she loved Angel Clare, perhaps all the more passionately from</p>

<p>knowing that the others had also lost their hearts to him.  There is</p>

<p>contagion in this sentiment, especially among women.  And yet that</p>

<p>same hungry nature had fought against this, but too feebly, and the</p>

<p>natural result had followed.</p>

<p>"I will never stand in your way, nor in the way of either of you!"</p>

<p>she declared to Retty that night in the bedroom (her tears running</p>

<p>down).  "I can't help this, my dear!  I don't think marrying is in</p>

<p>his mind at all; but if he were ever to ask me I should refuse him,</p>

<p>as I should refuse any man."</p>

<p>"Oh! would you?  Why?" said wondering Retty.</p>

<p>"It cannot be!  But I will be plain.  Putting myself quite on one</p>

<p>side, I don't think he will choose either of you."</p>

<p>"I have never expected it--thought of it!" moaned Retty.  "But O! I</p>

<p>wish I was dead!"</p>

<p>The poor child, torn by a feeling which she hardly understood, turned</p>

<p>to the other two girls who came upstairs just then.</p>

<p>"We be friends with her again," she said to them.  "She thinks no</p>

<p>more of his choosing her than we do."</p>

<p>So the reserve went off, and they were confiding and warm.</p>

<p>"I don't seem to care what I do now," said Marian, whose mood was</p>

<p>turned to its lowest bass.  "I was going to marry a dairyman at</p>

<p>Stickleford, who's asked me twice; but--my soul--I would put an end</p>

<p>to myself rather'n be his wife now!  Why don't ye speak, Izz?"</p>

<p>"To confess, then," murmured Izz, "I made sure to-day that he was</p>

<p>going to kiss me as he held me; and I lay still against his breast,</p>

<p>hoping and hoping, and never moved at all.  But he did not.  I don't</p>

<p>like biding here at Talbothays any longer!  I shall go hwome."</p>

<p>The air of the sleeping-chamber seemed to palpitate with the</p>

<p>hopeless passion of the girls.  They writhed feverishly under the</p>

<p>oppressiveness of an emotion thrust on them by cruel Nature's law--an</p>

<p>emotion which they had neither expected nor desired.  The incident</p>

<p>of the day had fanned the flame that was burning the inside of their</p>

<p>hearts out, and the torture was almost more than they could endure.</p>

<p>The differences which distinguished them as individuals were</p>

<p>abstracted by this passion, and each was but portion of one organism</p>

<p>called sex.  There was so much frankness and so little jealousy</p>

<p>because there was no hope.  Each one was a girl of fair common sense,</p>

<p>and she did not delude herself with any vain conceits, or deny her</p>

<p>love, or give herself airs, in the idea of outshining the others.</p>

<p>The full recognition of the futility of their infatuation, from a</p>

<p>social point of view; its purposeless beginning; its self-bounded</p>

<p>outlook; its lack of everything to justify its existence in the eye</p>

<p>of civilization (while lacking nothing in the eye of Nature); the one</p>

<p>fact that it did exist, ecstasizing them to a killing joy--all this</p>

<p>imparted to them a resignation, a dignity, which a practical and</p>

<p>sordid expectation of winning him as a husband would have destroyed.</p>

<p>They tossed and turned on their little beds, and the cheese-wring</p>

<p>dripped monotonously downstairs.</p>

<p>"B' you awake, Tess?" whispered one, half-an-hour later.</p>

<p>It was Izz Huett's voice.</p>

<p>Tess replied in the affirmative, whereupon also Retty and Marian</p>

<p>suddenly flung the bedclothes off them, and sighed--</p>

<p>"So be we!"</p>

<p>"I wonder what she is like--the lady they say his family have looked</p>

<p>out for him!"</p>

<p>"I wonder," said Izz.</p>

<p>"Some lady looked out for him?" gasped Tess, starting.  "I have never</p>

<p>heard o' that!"</p>

<p>"O yes--'tis whispered; a young lady of his own rank, chosen by his</p>

<p>family; a Doctor of Divinity's daughter near his father's parish of</p>

<p>Emminster; he don't much care for her, they say.  But he is sure to</p>

<p>marry her."</p>

<p>They had heard so very little of this; yet it was enough to build up</p>

<p>wretched dolorous dreams upon, there in the shade of the night.  They</p>

<p>pictured all the details of his being won round to consent, of the</p>

<p>wedding preparations, of the bride's happiness, of her dress and</p>

<p>veil, of her blissful home with him, when oblivion would have fallen</p>

<p>upon themselves as far as he and their love were concerned.  Thus</p>

<p>they talked, and ached, and wept till sleep charmed their sorrow</p>

<p>away.</p>

<p>After this disclosure Tess nourished no further foolish thought that</p>

<p>there lurked any grave and deliberate import in Clare's attentions</p>

<p>to her.  It was a passing summer love of her face, for love's own</p>

<p>temporary sake--nothing more. And the thorny crown of this sad</p>

<p>conception was that she whom he really did prefer in a cursory way</p>

<p>to the rest, she who knew herself to be more impassioned in nature,</p>

<p>cleverer, more beautiful than they, was in the eyes of propriety far</p>

<p>less worthy of him than the homelier ones whom he ignored.</p>

<p>XXIV</p>

<p>Amid the oozing fatness and warm ferments of the Froom Vale, at a</p>

<p>season when the rush of juices could almost be heard below the hiss</p>

<p>of fertilization, it was impossible that the most fanciful love</p>

<p>should not grow passionate.  The ready bosoms existing there were</p>

<p>impregnated by their surroundings.</p>

<p>July passed over their heads, and the Thermidorean weather which came</p>

<p>in its wake seemed an effort on the part of Nature to match the state</p>

<p>of hearts at Talbothays Dairy.  The air of the place, so fresh in the</p>

<p>spring and early summer, was stagnant and enervating now.  Its heavy</p>

<p>scents weighed upon them, and at mid-day the landscape seemed lying</p>

<p>in a swoon. Ethiopic scorchings browned the upper slopes of the</p>

<p>pastures, but there was still bright green herbage here where the</p>

<p>watercourses purled.  And as Clare was oppressed by the outward</p>

<p>heats, so was he burdened inwardly by waxing fervour of passion for</p>

<p>the soft and silent Tess.</p>

<p>The rains having passed, the uplands were dry.  The wheels of the</p>

<p>dairyman's spring-cart, as he sped home from market, licked up the</p>

<p>pulverized surface of the highway, and were followed by white ribands</p>

<p>of dust, as if they had set a thin powder-train on fire.  The cows</p>

<p>jumped wildly over the five-barred barton-gate, maddened by the</p>

<p>gad-fly; Dairyman Crick kept his shirt-sleeves permanently rolled up</p>

<p>from Monday to Saturday; open windows had no effect in ventilation</p>

<p>without open doors, and in the dairy-garden the blackbirds and</p>

<p>thrushes crept about under the currant-bushes, rather in the manner</p>

<p>of quadrupeds than of winged creatures.  The flies in the kitchen</p>

<p>were lazy, teasing, and familiar, crawling about in the unwonted</p>

<p>places, on the floors, into drawers, and over the backs of the</p>

<p>milkmaids' hands. Conversations were concerning sunstroke; while</p>

<p>butter-making, and still more butter-keeping, was a despair.</p>

<p>They milked entirely in the meads for coolness and convenience,</p>

<p>without driving in the cows.  During the day the animals obsequiously</p>

<p>followed the shadow of the smallest tree as it moved round the stem</p>

<p>with the diurnal roll; and when the milkers came they could hardly</p>

<p>stand still for the flies.</p>

<p>On one of these afternoons four or five unmilked cows chanced to</p>

<p>stand apart from the general herd, behind the corner of a hedge,</p>

<p>among them being Dumpling and Old Pretty, who loved Tess's hands</p>

<p>above those of any other maid.  When she rose from her stool under a</p>

<p>finished cow, Angel Clare, who had been observing her for some time,</p>

<p>asked her if she would take the aforesaid creatures next.  She</p>

<p>silently assented, and with her stool at arm's length, and the pail</p>

<p>against her knee, went round to where they stood.  Soon the sound of</p>

<p>Old Pretty's milk fizzing into the pail came through the hedge, and</p>

<p>then Angel felt inclined to go round the corner also, to finish off a</p>

<p>hard-yielding milcher who had strayed there, he being now as capable</p>

<p>of this as the dairyman himself.</p>

<p>All the men, and some of the women, when milking, dug their foreheads</p>

<p>into the cows and gazed into the pail.  But a few--mainly the younger</p>

<p>ones--rested their heads sideways.  This was Tess Durbeyfield's</p>

<p>habit, her temple pressing the milcher's flank, her eyes fixed on</p>

<p>the far end of the meadow with the quiet of one lost in meditation.</p>

<p>She was milking Old Pretty thus, and the sun chancing to be on the</p>

<p>milking-side, it shone flat upon her pink-gowned form and her white</p>

<p>curtain-bonnet, and upon her profile, rendering it keen as a cameo</p>

<p>cut from the dun background of the cow.</p>

<p>She did not know that Clare had followed her round, and that he sat</p>

<p>under his cow watching her.  The stillness of her head and features</p>

<p>was remarkable: she might have been in a trance, her eyes open, yet</p>

<p>unseeing.  Nothing in the picture moved but Old Pretty's tail and</p>

<p>Tess's pink hands, the latter so gently as to be a rhythmic pulsation</p>

<p>only, as if they were obeying a reflex stimulus, like a beating</p>

<p>heart.</p>

<p>How very lovable her face was to him.  Yet there was nothing ethereal</p>

<p>about it; all was real vitality, real warmth, real incarnation.  And</p>

<p>it was in her mouth that this culminated.  Eyes almost as deep and</p>

<p>speaking he had seen before, and cheeks perhaps as fair; brows as</p>

<p>arched, a chin and throat almost as shapely; her mouth he had seen</p>

<p>nothing to equal on the face of the earth.  To a young man with the</p>

<p>least fire in him that little upward lift in the middle of her red</p>

<p>top lip was distracting, infatuating, maddening.  He had never before</p>

<p>seen a woman's lips and teeth which forced upon his mind with such</p>

<p>persistent iteration the old Elizabethan simile of roses filled with</p>

<p>snow.  Perfect, he, as a lover, might have called them off-hand.  But</p>

<p>no--they were not perfect.  And it was the touch of the imperfect</p>

<p>upon the would-be perfect that gave the sweetness, because it was</p>

<p>that which gave the humanity.</p>

<p>Clare had studied the curves of those lips so many times that he</p>

<p>could reproduce them mentally with ease: and now, as they again</p>

<p>confronted him, clothed with colour and life, they sent an _aura_</p>

<p>over his flesh, a breeze through his nerves, which well nigh produced</p>

<p>a qualm; and actually produced, by some mysterious physiological</p>

<p>process, a prosaic sneeze.</p>

<p>She then became conscious that he was observing her; but she would</p>

<p>not show it by any change of position, though the curious dream-like</p>

<p>fixity disappeared, and a close eye might easily have discerned that</p>

<p>the rosiness of her face deepened, and then faded till only a tinge</p>

<p>of it was left.</p>

<p>The influence that had passed into Clare like an excitation from the</p>

<p>sky did not die down.  Resolutions, reticences, prudences, fears,</p>

<p>fell back like a defeated battalion.  He jumped up from his seat,</p>

<p>and, leaving his pail to be kicked over if the milcher had such a</p>

<p>mind, went quickly towards the desire of his eyes, and, kneeling down</p>

<p>beside her, clasped her in his arms.</p>

<p>Tess was taken completely by surprise, and she yielded to his embrace</p>

<p>with unreflecting inevitableness.  Having seen that it was really her</p>

<p>lover who had advanced, and no one else, her lips parted, and she</p>

<p>sank upon him in her momentary joy, with something very like an</p>

<p>ecstatic cry.</p>

<p>He had been on the point of kissing that too tempting mouth, but he</p>

<p>checked himself, for tender conscience' sake.</p>

<p>"Forgive me, Tess dear!" he whispered.  "I ought to have asked.</p>

<p>I--did not know what I was doing.  I do not mean it as a liberty.</p>

<p>I am devoted to you, Tessy, dearest, in all sincerity!"</p>

<p>Old Pretty by this time had looked round, puzzled; and seeing two</p>

<p>people crouching under her where, by immemorial custom, there should</p>

<p>have been only one, lifted her hind leg crossly.</p>

<p>"She is angry--she doesn't know what we mean--she'll kick over the</p>

<p>milk!" exclaimed Tess, gently striving to free herself, her eyes</p>

<p>concerned with the quadruped's actions, her heart more deeply</p>

<p>concerned with herself and Clare.</p>

<p>She slipped up from her seat, and they stood together, his arm still</p>

<p>encircling her.  Tess's eyes, fixed on distance, began to fill.</p>

<p>"Why do you cry, my darling?" he said.</p>

<p>"O--I don't know!" she murmured.</p>

<p>As she saw and felt more clearly the position she was in she became</p>

<p>agitated and tried to withdraw.</p>

<p>"Well, I have betrayed my feeling, Tess, at last," said he, with a</p>

<p>curious sigh of desperation, signifying unconsciously that his heart</p>

<p>had outrun his judgement.  "That I--love you dearly and truly I need</p>

<p>not say.  But I--it shall go no further now--it distresses you--I am</p>

<p>as surprised as you are.  You will not think I have presumed upon</p>

<p>your defencelessness--been too quick and unreflecting, will you?"</p>

<p>"N'--I can't tell."</p>

<p>He had allowed her to free herself; and in a minute or two the</p>

<p>milking of each was resumed.  Nobody had beheld the gravitation of</p>

<p>the two into one; and when the dairyman came round by that screened</p>

<p>nook a few minutes later, there was not a sign to reveal that</p>

<p>the markedly sundered pair were more to each other than mere</p>

<p>acquaintance.  Yet in the interval since Crick's last view of them</p>

<p>something had occurred which changed the pivot of the universe for</p>

<p>their two natures; something which, had he known its quality, the</p>

<p>dairyman would have despised, as a practical man; yet which was based</p>

<p>upon a more stubborn and resistless tendency than a whole heap of</p>

<p>so-called practicalities.  A veil had been whisked aside; the tract</p>

<p>of each one's outlook was to have a new horizon thenceforward--for a</p>

<p>short time or for a long.</p>

<p>END OF PHASE THE THIRD</p><empty-line /><p>Phase the Fourth: The Consequence</p>

<p>XXV</p>

<p>Clare, restless, went out into the dusk when evening drew on, she who</p>

<p>had won him having retired to her chamber.</p>

<p>The night was as sultry as the day.  There was no coolness after dark</p>

<p>unless on the grass.  Roads, garden-paths, the house-fronts, the</p>

<p>barton-walls were warm as hearths, and reflected the noontime</p>

<p>temperature into the noctambulist's face.</p>

<p>He sat on the east gate of the dairy-yard, and knew not what to think</p>

<p>of himself.  Feeling had indeed smothered judgement that day.</p>

<p>Since the sudden embrace, three hours before, the twain had kept</p>

<p>apart.  She seemed stilled, almost alarmed, at what had occurred,</p>

<p>while the novelty, unpremeditation, mastery of circumstance</p>

<p>disquieted him--palpitating, contemplative being that he was.  He</p>

<p>could hardly realize their true relations to each other as yet, and</p>

<p>what their mutual bearing should be before third parties</p>

<p>thenceforward.</p>

<p>Angel had come as pupil to this dairy in the idea that his temporary</p>

<p>existence here was to be the merest episode in his life, soon passed</p>

<p>through and early forgotten; he had come as to a place from which</p>

<p>as from a screened alcove he could calmly view the absorbing world</p>

<p>without, and, apostrophizing it with Walt Whitman--</p>

<p>  Crowds of men and women attired in the usual costumes,</p>

<p>  How curious you are to me!--</p>

<p>resolve upon a plan for plunging into that world anew.  But behold,</p>

<p>the absorbing scene had been imported hither.  What had been the</p>

<p>engrossing world had dissolved into an uninteresting outer dumb-show;</p>

<p>while here, in this apparently dim and unimpassioned place, novelty</p>

<p>had volcanically started up, as it had never, for him, started up</p>

<p>elsewhere.</p>

<p>Every window of the house being open, Clare could hear across the</p>

<p>yard each trivial sound of the retiring household.  The dairy-house,</p>

<p>so humble, so insignificant, so purely to him a place of constrained</p>

<p>sojourn that he had never hitherto deemed it of sufficient importance</p>

<p>to be reconnoitred as an object of any quality whatever in the</p>

<p>landscape; what was it now?  The aged and lichened brick gables</p>

<p>breathed forth "Stay!"  The windows smiled, the door coaxed and</p>

<p>beckoned, the creeper blushed confederacy.  A personality within</p>

<p>it was so far-reaching in her influence as to spread into and make</p>

<p>the bricks, mortar, and whole overhanging sky throb with a burning</p>

<p>sensibility.  Whose was this mighty personality? A milkmaid's.</p>

<p>It was amazing, indeed, to find how great a matter the life of the</p>

<p>obscure dairy had become to him.  And though new love was to be held</p>

<p>partly responsible for this, it was not solely so.  Many besides</p>

<p>Angel have learnt that the magnitude of lives is not as to their</p>

<p>external displacements, but as to their subjective experiences.  The</p>

<p>impressionable peasant leads a larger, fuller, more dramatic life</p>

<p>than the pachydermatous king.  Looking at it thus, he found that life</p>

<p>was to be seen of the same magnitude here as elsewhere.</p>

<p>Despite his heterodoxy, faults, and weaknesses, Clare was a man with</p>

<p>a conscience.  Tess was no insignificant creature to toy with and</p>

<p>dismiss; but a woman living her precious life--a life which, to</p>

<p>herself who endured or enjoyed it, possessed as great a dimension</p>

<p>as the life of the mightiest to himself.  Upon her sensations</p>

<p>the whole world depended to Tess; through her existence all her</p>

<p>fellow-creatures existed, to her.  The universe itself only came into</p>

<p>being for Tess on the particular day in the particular year in which</p>

<p>she was born.</p>

<p>This consciousness upon which he had intruded was the single</p>

<p>opportunity of existence ever vouchsafed to Tess by an unsympathetic</p>

<p>First Cause--her all; her every and only chance.  How then should he</p>

<p>look upon her as of less consequence than himself; as a pretty trifle</p>

<p>to caress and grow weary of; and not deal in the greatest seriousness</p>

<p>with the affection which he knew that he had awakened in her--so</p>

<p>fervid and so impressionable as she was under her reserve--in order</p>

<p>that it might not agonize and wreck her?</p>

<p>To encounter her daily in the accustomed manner would be to develop</p>

<p>what had begun.  Living in such close relations, to meet meant to</p>

<p>fall into endearment; flesh and blood could not resist it; and,</p>

<p>having arrived at no conclusion as to the issue of such a tendency,</p>

<p>he decided to hold aloof for the present from occupations in which</p>

<p>they would be mutually engaged.  As yet the harm done was small.</p>

<p>But it was not easy to carry out the resolution never to approach</p>

<p>her.  He was driven towards her by every heave of his pulse.</p>

<p>He thought he would go and see his friends.  It might be possible</p>

<p>to sound them upon this.  In less than five months his term here</p>

<p>would have ended, and after a few additional months spent upon other</p>

<p>farms he would be fully equipped in agricultural knowledge and in</p>

<p>a position to start on his own account.  Would not a farmer want a</p>

<p>wife, and should a farmer's wife be a drawing-room wax-figure, or a</p>

<p>woman who understood farming?  Notwithstanding the pleasing answer</p>

<p>returned to him by the silence, he resolved to go his journey.</p>

<p>One morning when they sat down to breakfast at Talbothays Dairy some</p>

<p>maid observed that she had not seen anything of Mr Clare that day.</p>

<p>"O no," said Dairyman Crick.  "Mr Clare has gone hwome to Emminster</p>

<p>to spend a few days wi' his kinsfolk."</p>

<p>For four impassioned ones around that table the sunshine of the</p>

<p>morning went out at a stroke, and the birds muffled their song.</p>

<p>But neither girl by word or gesture revealed her blankness.  "He's</p>

<p>getting on towards the end of his time wi' me," added the dairyman,</p>

<p>with a phlegm which unconsciously was brutal; "and so I suppose he</p>

<p>is beginning to see about his plans elsewhere."</p>

<p>"How much longer is he to bide here?" asked Izz Huett, the only</p>

<p>one of the gloom-stricken bevy who could trust her voice with the</p>

<p>question.</p>

<p>The others waited for the dairyman's answer as if their lives hung</p>

<p>upon it; Retty, with parted lips, gazing on the tablecloth, Marian</p>

<p>with heat added to her redness, Tess throbbing and looking out at</p>

<p>the meads.</p>

<p>"Well, I can't mind the exact day without looking at my</p>

<p>memorandum-book," replied Crick, with the same intolerable unconcern.</p>

<p>"And even that may be altered a bit.  He'll bide to get a little</p>

<p>practice in the calving out at the straw-yard, for certain.  He'll</p>

<p>hang on till the end of the year I should say."</p>

<p>Four months or so of torturing ecstasy in his society--of "pleasure</p>

<p>girdled about with pain".  After that the blackness of unutterable</p>

<p>night.</p>

<p>At this moment of the morning Angel Clare was riding along a narrow</p>

<p>lane ten miles distant from the breakfasters, in the direction of</p>

<p>his father's Vicarage at Emminster, carrying, as well as he could,</p>

<p>a little basket which contained some black-puddings and a bottle of</p>

<p>mead, sent by Mrs Crick, with her kind respects, to his parents.  The</p>

<p>white lane stretched before him, and his eyes were upon it; but they</p>

<p>were staring into next year, and not at the lane.  He loved her;</p>

<p>ought he to marry her?  Dared he to marry her?  What would his mother</p>

<p>and his brothers say?  What would he himself say a couple of years</p>

<p>after the event?  That would depend upon whether the germs of staunch</p>

<p>comradeship underlay the temporary emotion, or whether it were a</p>

<p>sensuous joy in her form only, with no substratum of everlastingness.</p>

<p>His father's hill-surrounded little town, the Tudor church-tower of</p>

<p>red stone, the clump of trees near the Vicarage, came at last into</p>

<p>view beneath him, and he rode down towards the well-known gate.</p>

<p>Casting a glance in the direction of the church before entering his</p>

<p>home, he beheld standing by the vestry-door a group of girls, of</p>

<p>ages between twelve and sixteen, apparently awaiting the arrival of</p>

<p>some other one, who in a moment became visible; a figure somewhat</p>

<p>older than the school-girls, wearing a broad-brimmed hat and</p>

<p>highly-starched cambric morning-gown, with a couple of books in her</p>

<p>hand.</p>

<p>Clare knew her well.  He could not be sure that she observed him; he</p>

<p>hoped she did not, so as to render it unnecessary that he should go</p>

<p>and speak to her, blameless creature that she was.  An overpowering</p>

<p>reluctance to greet her made him decide that she had not seen him.</p>

<p>The young lady was Miss Mercy Chant, the only daughter of his</p>

<p>father's neighbour and friend, whom it was his parents' quiet hope</p>

<p>that he might wed some day.  She was great at Antinomianism and</p>

<p>Bible-classes, and was plainly going to hold a class now.  Clare's</p>

<p>mind flew to the impassioned, summer-steeped heathens in the Var</p>

<p>Vale, their rosy faces court-patched with cow-droppings; and to one</p>

<p>the most impassioned of them all.</p>

<p>It was on the impulse of the moment that he had resolved to trot</p>

<p>over to Emminster, and hence had not written to apprise his mother</p>

<p>and father, aiming, however, to arrive about the breakfast hour,</p>

<p>before they should have gone out to their parish duties.  He was</p>

<p>a little late, and they had already sat down to the morning meal.</p>

<p>The group at the table jumped up to welcome him as soon as he</p>

<p>entered.  They were his father and mother, his brother the Reverend</p>

<p>Felix--curate at a town in the adjoining county, home for the inside</p>

<p>of a fortnight--and his other brother, the Reverend Cuthbert, the</p>

<p>classical scholar, and Fellow and Dean of his College, down from</p>

<p>Cambridge for the long vacation.  His mother appeared in a cap and</p>

<p>silver spectacles, and his father looked what in fact he was--an</p>

<p>earnest, God-fearing man, somewhat gaunt, in years about sixty-five,</p>

<p>his pale face lined with thought and purpose.  Over their heads hung</p>

<p>the picture of Angel's sister, the eldest of the family, sixteen</p>

<p>years his senior, who had married a missionary and gone out to</p>

<p>Africa.</p>

<p>Old Mr Clare was a clergyman of a type which, within the last twenty</p>

<p>years, has well nigh dropped out of contemporary life.  A spiritual</p>

<p>descendant in the direct line from Wycliff, Huss, Luther, Calvin; an</p>

<p>Evangelical of the Evangelicals, a Conversionist, a man of Apostolic</p>

<p>simplicity in life and thought, he had in his raw youth made up his</p>

<p>mind once for all in the deeper questions of existence, and admitted</p>

<p>no further reasoning on them thenceforward.  He was regarded even by</p>

<p>those of his own date and school of thinking as extreme; while, on</p>

<p>the other hand, those totally opposed to him were unwillingly won</p>

<p>to admiration for his thoroughness, and for the remarkable power he</p>

<p>showed in dismissing all question as to principles in his energy for</p>

<p>applying them.  He loved Paul of Tarsus, liked St John, hated St</p>

<p>James as much as he dared, and regarded with mixed feelings Timothy,</p>

<p>Titus, and Philemon.  The New Testament was less a Christiad then a</p>

<p>Pauliad to his intelligence--less an argument than an intoxication.</p>

<p>His creed of determinism was such that it almost amounted to a</p>

<p>vice, and quite amounted, on its negative side, to a renunciative</p>

<p>philosophy which had cousinship with that of Schopenhauer and</p>

<p>Leopardi.  He despised the Canons and Rubric, swore by the Articles,</p>

<p>and deemed himself consistent through the whole category--which in a</p>

<p>way he might have been.  One thing he certainly was--sincere.</p>

<p>To the aesthetic, sensuous, pagan pleasure in natural life and lush</p>

<p>womanhood which his son Angel had lately been experiencing in Var</p>

<p>Vale, his temper would have been antipathetic in a high degree, had</p>

<p>he either by inquiry or imagination been able to apprehend it.  Once</p>

<p>upon a time Angel had been so unlucky as to say to his father, in</p>

<p>a moment of irritation, that it might have resulted far better for</p>

<p>mankind if Greece had been the source of the religion of modern</p>

<p>civilization, and not Palestine; and his father's grief was of that</p>

<p>blank description which could not realize that there might lurk a</p>

<p>thousandth part of a truth, much less a half truth or a whole truth,</p>

<p>in such a proposition.  He had simply preached austerely at Angel for</p>

<p>some time after.  But the kindness of his heart was such that he</p>

<p>never resented anything for long, and welcomed his son to-day with a</p>

<p>smile which was as candidly sweet as a child's.</p>

<p>Angel sat down, and the place felt like home; yet he did not so much</p>

<p>as formerly feel himself one of the family gathered there.  Every</p>

<p>time that he returned hither he was conscious of this divergence,</p>

<p>and since he had last shared in the Vicarage life it had grown even</p>

<p>more distinctly foreign to his own than usual.  Its transcendental</p>

<p>aspirations--still unconsciously based on the geocentric view of</p>

<p>things, a zenithal paradise, a nadiral hell--were as foreign to his</p>

<p>own as if they had been the dreams of people on another planet.</p>

<p>Latterly he had seen only Life, felt only the great passionate pulse</p>

<p>of existence, unwarped, uncontorted, untrammelled by those creeds</p>

<p>which futilely attempt to check what wisdom would be content to</p>

<p>regulate.</p>

<p>On their part they saw a great difference in him, a growing</p>

<p>divergence from the Angel Clare of former times.  It was chiefly a</p>

<p>difference in his manner that they noticed just now, particularly</p>

<p>his brothers.  He was getting to behave like a farmer; he flung his</p>

<p>legs about; the muscles of his face had grown more expressive; his</p>

<p>eyes looked as much information as his tongue spoke, and more.  The</p>

<p>manner of the scholar had nearly disappeared; still more the manner</p>

<p>of the drawing-room young man.  A prig would have said that he had</p>

<p>lost culture, and a prude that he had become coarse.  Such was the</p>

<p>contagion of domiciliary fellowship with the Talbothays nymphs and</p>

<p>swains.</p>

<p>After breakfast he walked with his two brothers, non-evangelical,</p>

<p>well-educated, hall-marked young men, correct to their remotest</p>

<p>fibre, such unimpeachable models as are turned out yearly by</p>

<p>the lathe of a systematic tuition.  They were both somewhat</p>

<p>short-sighted, and when it was the custom to wear a single eyeglass</p>

<p>and string they wore a single eyeglass and string; when it was the</p>

<p>custom to wear a double glass they wore a double glass; when it was</p>

<p>the custom to wear spectacles they wore spectacles straightway, all</p>

<p>without reference to the particular variety of defect in their own</p>

<p>vision.  When Wordsworth was enthroned they carried pocket copies;</p>

<p>and when Shelley was belittled they allowed him to grow dusty on</p>

<p>their shelves.  When Correggio's Holy Families were admired, they</p>

<p>admired Correggio's Holy Families; when he was decried in favour</p>

<p>of Velasquez, they sedulously followed suit without any personal</p>

<p>objection.</p>

<p>If these two noticed Angel's growing social ineptness, he noticed</p>

<p>their growing mental limitations.  Felix seemed to him all Church;</p>

<p>Cuthbert all College.  His Diocesan Synod and Visitations were the</p>

<p>mainsprings of the world to the one; Cambridge to the other.  Each</p>

<p>brother candidly recognized that there were a few unimportant score</p>

<p>of millions of outsiders in civilized society, persons who were</p>

<p>neither University men nor churchmen; but they were to be tolerated</p>

<p>rather than reckoned with and respected.</p>

<p>They were both dutiful and attentive sons, and were regular in their</p>

<p>visits to their parents.  Felix, though an offshoot from a far more</p>

<p>recent point in the devolution of theology than his father, was less</p>

<p>self-sacrificing and disinterested.  More tolerant than his father of</p>

<p>a contradictory opinion, in its aspect as a danger to its holder, he</p>

<p>was less ready than his father to pardon it as a slight to his own</p>

<p>teaching.  Cuthbert was, upon the whole, the more liberal-minded,</p>

<p>though, with greater subtlety, he had not so much heart.</p>

<p>As they walked along the hillside Angel's former feeling revived</p>

<p>in him--that whatever their advantages by comparison with himself,</p>

<p>neither saw or set forth life as it really was lived.  Perhaps, as</p>

<p>with many men, their opportunities of observation were not so good</p>

<p>as their opportunities of expression.  Neither had an adequate</p>

<p>conception of the complicated forces at work outside the smooth and</p>

<p>gentle current in which they and their associates floated.  Neither</p>

<p>saw the difference between local truth and universal truth; that what</p>

<p>the inner world said in their clerical and academic hearing was quite</p>

<p>a different thing from what the outer world was thinking.</p>

<p>"I suppose it is farming or nothing for you now, my dear fellow,"</p>

<p>Felix was saying, among other things, to his youngest brother, as</p>

<p>he looked through his spectacles at the distant fields with sad</p>

<p>austerity.  "And, therefore, we must make the best of it.  But I do</p>

<p>entreat you to endeavour to keep as much as possible in touch with</p>

<p>moral ideals.  Farming, of course, means roughing it externally; but</p>

<p>high thinking may go with plain living, nevertheless."</p>

<p>"Of course it may," said Angel.  "Was it not proved nineteen hundred</p>

<p>years ago--if I may trespass upon your domain a little?  Why should</p>

<p>you think, Felix, that I am likely to drop my high thinking and my</p>

<p>moral ideals?"</p>

<p>"Well, I fancied, from the tone of your letters and our</p>

<p>conversation--it may be fancy only--that you were somehow losing</p>

<p>intellectual grasp.  Hasn't it struck you, Cuthbert?"</p>

<p>"Now, Felix," said Angel drily, "we are very good friends, you</p>

<p>know; each of us treading our allotted circles; but if it comes to</p>

<p>intellectual grasp, I think you, as a contented dogmatist, had</p>

<p>better leave mine alone, and inquire what has become of yours."</p>

<p>They returned down the hill to dinner, which was fixed at any time at</p>

<p>which their father's and mother's morning work in the parish usually</p>

<p>concluded.  Convenience as regarded afternoon callers was the last</p>

<p>thing to enter into the consideration of unselfish Mr and Mrs Clare;</p>

<p>though the three sons were sufficiently in unison on this matter to</p>

<p>wish that their parents would conform a little to modern notions.</p>

<p>The walk had made them hungry, Angel in particular, who was now</p>

<p>an outdoor man, accustomed to the profuse _dapes inemptae_ of the</p>

<p>dairyman's somewhat coarsely-laden table.  But neither of the old</p>

<p>people had arrived, and it was not till the sons were almost tired of</p>

<p>waiting that their parents entered.  The self-denying pair had been</p>

<p>occupied in coaxing the appetites of some of their sick parishioners,</p>

<p>whom they, somewhat inconsistently, tried to keep imprisoned in the</p>

<p>flesh, their own appetites being quite forgotten.</p>

<p>The family sat down to table, and a frugal meal of cold viands</p>

<p>was deposited before them.  Angel looked round for Mrs Crick's</p>

<p>black-puddings, which he had directed to be nicely grilled as they</p>

<p>did them at the dairy, and of which he wished his father and mother</p>

<p>to appreciate the marvellous herbal savours as highly as he did</p>

<p>himself.</p>

<p>"Ah! you are looking for the black-puddings, my dear boy," observed</p>

<p>Clare's mother.  "But I am sure you will not mind doing without them</p>

<p>as I am sure your father and I shall not, when you know the reason.</p>

<p>I suggested to him that we should take Mrs Crick's kind present to</p>

<p>the children of the man who can earn nothing just now because of his</p>

<p>attacks of delirium tremens; and he agreed that it would be a great</p>

<p>pleasure to them; so we did."</p>

<p>"Of course," said Angel cheerfully, looking round for the mead.</p>

<p>"I found the mead so extremely alcoholic," continued his mother,</p>

<p>"that it was quite unfit for use as a beverage, but as valuable</p>

<p>as rum or brandy in an emergency; so I have put it in my</p>

<p>medicine-closet."</p>

<p>"We never drink spirits at this table, on principle," added his</p>

<p>father.</p>

<p>"But what shall I tell the dairyman's wife?" said Angel.</p>

<p>"The truth, of course," said his father.</p>

<p>"I rather wanted to say we enjoyed the mead and the black-puddings</p>

<p>very much.  She is a kind, jolly sort of body, and is sure to ask me</p>

<p>directly I return."</p>

<p>"You cannot, if we did not," Mr Clare answered lucidly.</p>

<p>"Ah--no; though that mead was a drop of pretty tipple."</p>

<p>"A what?" said Cuthbert and Felix both.</p>

<p>"Oh--'tis an expression they use down at Talbothays," replied Angel,</p>

<p>blushing.  He felt that his parents were right in their practice if</p>

<p>wrong in their want of sentiment, and said no more.</p>

<p>XXVI</p>

<p>It was not till the evening, after family prayers, that Angel found</p>

<p>opportunity of broaching to his father one or two subjects near his</p>

<p>heart.  He had strung himself up to the purpose while kneeling behind</p>

<p>his brothers on the carpet, studying the little nails in the heels of</p>

<p>their walking boots.  When the service was over they went out of the</p>

<p>room with their mother, and Mr Clare and himself were left alone.</p>

<p>The young man first discussed with the elder his plans for the</p>

<p>attainment of his position as a farmer on an extensive scale--either</p>

<p>in England or in the Colonies.  His father then told him that, as he</p>

<p>had not been put to the expense of sending Angel up to Cambridge, he</p>

<p>had felt it his duty to set by a sum of money every year towards the</p>

<p>purchase or lease of land for him some day, that he might not feel</p>

<p>himself unduly slighted.</p>

<p>"As far as worldly wealth goes," continued his father, "you will no</p>

<p>doubt stand far superior to your brothers in a few years."</p>

<p>This considerateness on old Mr Clare's part led Angel onward to the</p>

<p>other and dearer subject.  He observed to his father that he was</p>

<p>then six-and-twenty, and that when he should start in the farming</p>

<p>business he would require eyes in the back of his head to see to all</p>

<p>matters--some one would be necessary to superintend the domestic</p>

<p>labours of his establishment whilst he was afield.  Would it not be</p>

<p>well, therefore, for him to marry?</p>

<p>His father seemed to think this idea not unreasonable; and then Angel</p>

<p>put the question--</p>

<p>"What kind of wife do you think would be best for me as a thrifty</p>

<p>hard-working farmer?"</p>

<p>"A truly Christian woman, who will be a help and a comfort to you in</p>

<p>your goings-out and your comings-in.  Beyond that, it really matters</p>

<p>little.  Such an one can be found; indeed, my earnest-minded friend</p>

<p>and neighbour, Dr Chant--"</p>

<p>"But ought she not primarily to be able to milk cows, churn good</p>

<p>butter, make immense cheeses; know how to sit hens and turkeys and</p>

<p>rear chickens, to direct a field of labourers in an emergency, and</p>

<p>estimate the value of sheep and calves?"</p>

<p>"Yes; a farmer's wife; yes, certainly.  It would be desirable."  Mr</p>

<p>Clare, the elder, had plainly never thought of these points before.</p>

<p>"I was going to add," he said, "that for a pure and saintly woman you</p>

<p>will not find one more to your true advantage, and certainly not more</p>

<p>to your mother's mind and my own, than your friend Mercy, whom you</p>

<p>used to show a certain interest in.  It is true that my neighbour</p>

<p>Chant's daughter had lately caught up the fashion of the younger</p>

<p>clergy round about us for decorating the Communion-table--altar, as I</p>

<p>was shocked to hear her call it one day--with flowers and other stuff</p>

<p>on festival occasions.  But her father, who is quite as opposed to</p>

<p>such flummery as I, says that can be cured.  It is a mere girlish</p>

<p>outbreak which, I am sure, will not be permanent."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes; Mercy is good and devout, I know.  But, father, don't you</p>

<p>think that a young woman equally pure and virtuous as Miss Chant,</p>

<p>but one who, in place of that lady's ecclesiastical accomplishments,</p>

<p>understands the duties of farm life as well as a farmer himself,</p>

<p>would suit me infinitely better?"</p>

<p>His father persisted in his conviction that a knowledge of a farmer's</p>

<p>wife's duties came second to a Pauline view of humanity; and the</p>

<p>impulsive Angel, wishing to honour his father's feelings and to</p>

<p>advance the cause of his heart at the same time, grew specious.</p>

<p>He said that fate or Providence had thrown in his way a woman who</p>

<p>possessed every qualification to be the helpmate of an agriculturist,</p>

<p>and was decidedly of a serious turn of mind.  He would not say</p>

<p>whether or not she had attached herself to the sound Low Church</p>

<p>School of his father; but she would probably be open to conviction</p>

<p>on that point; she was a regular church-goer of simple faith;</p>

<p>honest-hearted, receptive, intelligent, graceful to a degree, chaste</p>

<p>as a vestal, and, in personal appearance, exceptionally beautiful.</p>

<p>"Is she of a family such as you would care to marry into--a lady, in</p>

<p>short?" asked his startled mother, who had come softly into the study</p>

<p>during the conversation.</p>

<p>"She is not what in common parlance is called a lady," said Angel,</p>

<p>unflinchingly, "for she is a cottager's daughter, as I am proud to</p>

<p>say.  But she IS a lady, nevertheless--in feeling and nature."</p>

<p>"Mercy Chant is of a very good family."</p>

<p>"Pooh!--what's the advantage of that, mother?" said Angel quickly.</p>

<p>"How is family to avail the wife of a man who has to rough it as I</p>

<p>have, and shall have to do?"</p>

<p>"Mercy is accomplished.  And accomplishments have their charm,"</p>

<p>returned his mother, looking at him through her silver spectacles.</p>

<p>"As to external accomplishments, what will be the use of them in the</p>

<p>life I am going to lead?--while as to her reading, I can take that</p>

<p>in hand.  She'll be apt pupil enough, as you would say if you knew</p>

<p>her. She's brim full of poetry--actualized poetry, if I may use the</p>

<p>expression.  She LIVES what paper-poets only write...  And she is an</p>

<p>unimpeachable Christian, I am sure; perhaps of the very tribe, genus,</p>

<p>and species you desire to propagate."</p>

<p>"O Angel, you are mocking!"</p>

<p>"Mother, I beg pardon.  But as she really does attend Church almost</p>

<p>every Sunday morning, and is a good Christian girl, I am sure you</p>

<p>will tolerate any social shortcomings for the sake of that quality,</p>

<p>and feel that I may do worse than choose her."  Angel waxed quite</p>

<p>earnest on that rather automatic orthodoxy in his beloved Tess which</p>

<p>(never dreaming that it might stand him in such good stead) he had</p>

<p>been prone to slight when observing it practised by her and the other</p>

<p>milkmaids, because of its obvious unreality amid beliefs essentially</p>

<p>naturalistic.</p>

<p>In their sad doubts as to whether their son had himself any right</p>

<p>whatever to the title he claimed for the unknown young woman, Mr and</p>

<p>Mrs Clare began to feel it as an advantage not to be overlooked that</p>

<p>she at least was sound in her views; especially as the conjunction of</p>

<p>the pair must have arisen by an act of Providence; for Angel never</p>

<p>would have made orthodoxy a condition of his choice.  They said</p>

<p>finally that it was better not to act in a hurry, but that they would</p>

<p>not object to see her.</p>

<p>Angel therefore refrained from declaring more particulars now.</p>

<p>He felt that, single-minded and self-sacrificing as his parents</p>

<p>were, there yet existed certain latent prejudices of theirs, as</p>

<p>middle-class people, which it would require some tact to overcome.</p>

<p>For though legally at liberty to do as he chose, and though their</p>

<p>daughter-in-law's qualifications could make no practical difference</p>

<p>to their lives, in the probability of her living far away from them,</p>

<p>he wished for affection's sake not to wound their sentiment in the</p>

<p>most important decision of his life.</p>

<p>He observed his own inconsistencies in dwelling upon accidents in</p>

<p>Tess's life as if they were vital features.  It was for herself that</p>

<p>he loved Tess; her soul, her heart, her substance--not for her skill</p>

<p>in the dairy, her aptness as his scholar, and certainly not for</p>

<p>her simple formal faith-professions.  Her unsophisticated open-air</p>

<p>existence required no varnish of conventionality to make it palatable</p>

<p>to him.  He held that education had as yet but little affected the</p>

<p>beats of emotion and impulse on which domestic happiness depends.  It</p>

<p>was probable that, in the lapse of ages, improved systems of moral</p>

<p>and intellectual training would appreciably, perhaps considerably,</p>

<p>elevate the involuntary and even the unconscious instincts of human</p>

<p>nature; but up to the present day, culture, as far as he could see,</p>

<p>might be said to have affected only the mental epiderm of those</p>

<p>lives which had been brought under its influence.  This belief was</p>

<p>confirmed by his experience of women, which, having latterly been</p>

<p>extended from the cultivated middle-class into the rural community,</p>

<p>had taught him how much less was the intrinsic difference between the</p>

<p>good and wise woman of one social stratum and the good and wise woman</p>

<p>of another social stratum, than between the good and bad, the wise</p>

<p>and the foolish, of the same stratum or class.</p>

<p>It was the morning of his departure.  His brothers had already left</p>

<p>the Vicarage to proceed on a walking tour in the north, whence one</p>

<p>was to return to his college, and the other to his curacy.  Angel</p>

<p>might have accompanied them, but preferred to rejoin his sweetheart</p>

<p>at Talbothays.  He would have been an awkward member of the</p>

<p>party; for, though the most appreciative humanist, the most ideal</p>

<p>religionist, even the best-versed Christologist of the three, there</p>

<p>was alienation in the standing consciousness that his squareness</p>

<p>would not fit the round hole that had been prepared for him.  To</p>

<p>neither Felix nor Cuthbert had he ventured to mention Tess.</p>

<p>His mother made him sandwiches, and his father accompanied him,</p>

<p>on his own mare, a little way along the road.  Having fairly well</p>

<p>advanced his own affairs, Angel listened in a willing silence, as</p>

<p>they jogged on together through the shady lanes, to his father's</p>

<p>account of his parish difficulties, and the coldness of brother</p>

<p>clergymen whom he loved, because of his strict interpretations of</p>

<p>the New Testament by the light of what they deemed a pernicious</p>

<p>Calvinistic doctrine.</p>

<p>"Pernicious!" said Mr Clare, with genial scorn; and he proceeded to</p>

<p>recount experiences which would show the absurdity of that idea.</p>

<p>He told of wondrous conversions of evil livers of which he had been</p>

<p>the instrument, not only amongst the poor, but amongst the rich and</p>

<p>well-to-do; and he also candidly admitted many failures.</p>

<p>As an instance of the latter, he mentioned the case of a young</p>

<p>upstart squire named d'Urberville, living some forty miles off, in</p>

<p>the neighbourhood of Trantridge.</p>

<p>"Not one of the ancient d'Urbervilles of Kingsbere and other places?"</p>

<p>asked his son.  "That curiously historic worn-out family with its</p>

<p>ghostly legend of the coach-and-four?"</p>

<p>"O no.  The original d'Urbervilles decayed and disappeared sixty</p>

<p>or eighty years ago--at least, I believe so.  This seems to be a</p>

<p>new family which had taken the name; for the credit of the former</p>

<p>knightly line I hope they are spurious, I'm sure.  But it is odd</p>

<p>to hear you express interest in old families.  I thought you set less</p>

<p>store by them even than I."</p>

<p>"You misapprehend me, father; you often do," said Angel with a</p>

<p>little impatience.  "Politically I am sceptical as to the virtue of</p>

<p>their being old.  Some of the wise even among themselves 'exclaim</p>

<p>against their own succession,' as Hamlet puts it; but lyrically,</p>

<p>dramatically, and even historically, I am tenderly attached to them."</p>

<p>This distinction, though by no means a subtle one, was yet too</p>

<p>subtle for Mr Clare the elder, and he went on with the story he had</p>

<p>been about to relate; which was that after the death of the senior</p>

<p>so-called d'Urberville, the young man developed the most culpable</p>

<p>passions, though he had a blind mother, whose condition should have</p>

<p>made him know better.  A knowledge of his career having come to</p>

<p>the ears of Mr Clare, when he was in that part of the country</p>

<p>preaching missionary sermons, he boldly took occasion to speak to</p>

<p>the delinquent on his spiritual state.  Though he was a stranger,</p>

<p>occupying another's pulpit, he had felt this to be his duty, and</p>

<p>took for his text the words from St Luke: "Thou fool, this night thy</p>

<p>soul shall be required of thee!"  The young man much resented this</p>

<p>directness of attack, and in the war of words which followed when</p>

<p>they met he did not scruple publicly to insult Mr Clare, without</p>

<p>respect for his gray hairs.</p>

<p>Angel flushed with distress.</p>

<p>"Dear father," he said sadly, "I wish you would not expose yourself</p>

<p>to such gratuitous pain from scoundrels!"</p>

<p>"Pain?" said his father, his rugged face shining in the ardour of</p>

<p>self-abnegation.  "The only pain to me was pain on his account, poor,</p>

<p>foolish young man.  Do you suppose his incensed words could give</p>

<p>me any pain, or even his blows?  'Being reviled we bless; being</p>

<p>persecuted we suffer it; being defamed we entreat; we are made as the</p>

<p>filth of the world, and as the offscouring of all things unto this</p>

<p>day.'  Those ancient and noble words to the Corinthians are strictly</p>

<p>true at this present hour."</p>

<p>"Not blows, father?  He did not proceed to blows?"</p>

<p>"No, he did not.  Though I have borne blows from men in a mad state</p>

<p>of intoxication."</p>

<p>"No!"</p>

<p>"A dozen times, my boy.  What then?  I have saved them from the guilt</p>

<p>of murdering their own flesh and blood thereby; and they have lived</p>

<p>to thank me, and praise God."</p>

<p>"May this young man do the same!" said Angel fervently.  "But I fear</p>

<p>otherwise, from what you say."</p>

<p>"We'll hope, nevertheless," said Mr Clare.  "And I continue to pray</p>

<p>for him, though on this side of the grave we shall probably never</p>

<p>meet again.  But, after all, one of those poor words of mine may</p>

<p>spring up in his heart as a good seed some day."</p>

<p>Now, as always, Clare's father was sanguine as a child; and though</p>

<p>the younger could not accept his parent's narrow dogma, he revered</p>

<p>his practice and recognized the hero under the pietist.  Perhaps he</p>

<p>revered his father's practice even more now than ever, seeing that,</p>

<p>in the question of making Tessy his wife, his father had not once</p>

<p>thought of inquiring whether she were well provided or penniless.</p>

<p>The same unworldliness was what had necessitated Angel's getting</p>

<p>a living as a farmer, and would probably keep his brothers in the</p>

<p>position of poor parsons for the term of their activities; yet Angel</p>

<p>admired it none the less.  Indeed, despite his own heterodoxy, Angel</p>

<p>often felt that he was nearer to his father on the human side than</p>

<p>was either of his brethren.</p>

<p>XXVII</p>

<p>An up-hill and down-hill ride of twenty-odd miles through a garish</p>

<p>mid-day atmosphere brought him in the afternoon to a detached knoll</p>

<p>a mile or two west of Talbothays, whence he again looked into that</p>

<p>green trough of sappiness and humidity, the valley of the Var or</p>

<p>Froom.  Immediately he began to descend from the upland to the fat</p>

<p>alluvial soil below, the atmosphere grew heavier; the languid perfume</p>

<p>of the summer fruits, the mists, the hay, the flowers, formed therein</p>

<p>a vast pool of odour which at this hour seemed to make the animals,</p>

<p>the very bees and butterflies drowsy. Clare was now so familiar with</p>

<p>the spot that he knew the individual cows by their names when, a long</p>

<p>distance off, he saw them dotted about the meads.  It was with a</p>

<p>sense of luxury that he recognized his power of viewing life here</p>

<p>from its inner side, in a way that had been quite foreign to him in</p>

<p>his student-days; and, much as he loved his parents, he could not</p>

<p>help being aware that to come here, as now, after an experience of</p>

<p>home-life, affected him like throwing off splints and bandages; even</p>

<p>the one customary curb on the humours of English rural societies</p>

<p>being absent in this place, Talbothays having no resident landlord.</p>

<p>Not a human being was out of doors at the dairy.  The denizens were</p>

<p>all enjoying the usual afternoon nap of an hour or so which the</p>

<p>exceedingly early hours kept in summer-time rendered a necessity.</p>

<p>At the door the wood-hooped pails, sodden and bleached by infinite</p>

<p>scrubbings, hung like hats on a stand upon the forked and peeled limb</p>

<p>of an oak fixed there for that purpose; all of them ready and dry</p>

<p>for the evening milking.  Angel entered, and went through the silent</p>

<p>passages of the house to the back quarters, where he listened for a</p>

<p>moment.  Sustained snores came from the cart-house, where some of</p>

<p>the men were lying down; the grunt and squeal of sweltering pigs</p>

<p>arose from the still further distance.  The large-leaved rhubarb and</p>

<p>cabbage plants slept too, their broad limp surfaces hanging in the</p>

<p>sun like half-closed umbrellas.</p>

<p>He unbridled and fed his horse, and as he re-entered the house the</p>

<p>clock struck three.  Three was the afternoon skimming-hour; and, with</p>

<p>the stroke, Clare heard the creaking of the floor-boards above, and</p>

<p>then the touch of a descending foot on the stairs.  It was Tess's,</p>

<p>who in another moment came down before his eyes.</p>

<p>She had not heard him enter, and hardly realized his presence there.</p>

<p>She was yawning, and he saw the red interior of her mouth as if it</p>

<p>had been a snake's.  She had stretched one arm so high above her</p>

<p>coiled-up cable of hair that he could see its satin delicacy above</p>

<p>the sunburn; her face was flushed with sleep, and her eyelids hung</p>

<p>heavy over their pupils.  The brim-fulness of her nature breathed</p>

<p>from her.  It was a moment when a woman's soul is more incarnate than</p>

<p>at any other time; when the most spiritual beauty bespeaks itself</p>

<p>flesh; and sex takes the outside place in the presentation.</p>

<p>Then those eyes flashed brightly through their filmy heaviness,</p>

<p>before the remainder of her face was well awake.  With an oddly</p>

<p>compounded look of gladness, shyness, and surprise, she exclaimed--"O</p>

<p>Mr Clare!  How you frightened me--I--"</p>

<p>There had not at first been time for her to think of the changed</p>

<p>relations which his declaration had introduced; but the full sense of</p>

<p>the matter rose up in her face when she encountered Clare's tender</p>

<p>look as he stepped forward to the bottom stair.</p>

<p>"Dear, darling Tessy!" he whispered, putting his arm round her, and</p>

<p>his face to her flushed cheek.  "Don't, for Heaven's sake, Mister me</p>

<p>any more.  I have hastened back so soon because of you!"</p>

<p>Tess's excitable heart beat against his by way of reply; and there</p>

<p>they stood upon the red-brick floor of the entry, the sun slanting in</p>

<p>by the window upon his back, as he held her tightly to his breast;</p>

<p>upon her inclining face, upon the blue veins of her temple, upon her</p>

<p>naked arm, and her neck, and into the depths of her hair.  Having</p>

<p>been lying down in her clothes she was warm as a sunned cat.  At</p>

<p>first she would not look straight up at him, but her eyes soon</p>

<p>lifted, and his plumbed the deepness of the ever-varying pupils, with</p>

<p>their radiating fibrils of blue, and black, and gray, and violet,</p>

<p>while she regarded him as Eve at her second waking might have</p>

<p>regarded Adam.</p>

<p>"I've got to go a-skimming," she pleaded, "and I have on'y old Deb to</p>

<p>help me to-day.  Mrs Crick is gone to market with Mr Crick, and Retty</p>

<p>is not well, and the others are gone out somewhere, and won't be home</p>

<p>till milking."</p>

<p>As they retreated to the milk-house Deborah Fyander appeared on the</p>

<p>stairs.</p>

<p>"I have come back, Deborah," said Mr Clare, upwards.  "So I can help</p>

<p>Tess with the skimming; and, as you are very tired, I am sure, you</p>

<p>needn't come down till milking-time."</p>

<p>Possibly the Talbothays milk was not very thoroughly skimmed that</p>

<p>afternoon.  Tess was in a dream wherein familiar objects appeared</p>

<p>as having light and shade and position, but no particular outline.</p>

<p>Every time she held the skimmer under the pump to cool it for the</p>

<p>work her hand trembled, the ardour of his affection being so palpable</p>

<p>that she seemed to flinch under it like a plant in too burning a sun.</p>

<p>Then he pressed her again to his side, and when she had done running</p>

<p>her forefinger round the leads to cut off the cream-edge, he cleaned</p>

<p>it in nature's way; for the unconstrained manners of Talbothays dairy</p>

<p>came convenient now.</p>

<p>"I may as well say it now as later, dearest," he resumed gently.  "I</p>

<p>wish to ask you something of a very practical nature, which I have</p>

<p>been thinking of ever since that day last week in the meads.  I shall</p>

<p>soon want to marry, and, being a farmer, you see I shall require for</p>

<p>my wife a woman who knows all about the management of farms.  Will</p>

<p>you be that woman, Tessy?"</p>

<p>He put it that way that she might not think he had yielded to an</p>

<p>impulse of which his head would disapprove.</p>

<p>She turned quite careworn.  She had bowed to the inevitable result of</p>

<p>proximity, the necessity of loving him; but she had not calculated</p>

<p>upon this sudden corollary, which, indeed, Clare had put before her</p>

<p>without quite meaning himself to do it so soon.  With pain that was</p>

<p>like the bitterness of dissolution she murmured the words of her</p>

<p>indispensable and sworn answer as an honourable woman.</p>

<p>"O Mr Clare--I cannot be your wife--I cannot be!"</p>

<p>The sound of her own decision seemed to break Tess's very heart, and</p>

<p>she bowed her face in her grief.</p>

<p>"But, Tess!" he said, amazed at her reply, and holding her still more</p>

<p>greedily close.  "Do you say no?  Surely you love me?"</p>

<p>"O yes, yes!  And I would rather be yours than anybody's in the</p>

<p>world," returned the sweet and honest voice of the distressed girl.</p>

<p>"But I CANNOT marry you!"</p>

<p>"Tess," he said, holding her at arm's length, "you are engaged to</p>

<p>marry some one else!"</p>

<p>"No, no!"</p>

<p>"Then why do you refuse me?"</p>

<p>"I don't want to marry!  I have not thought of doing it.  I cannot!</p>

<p>I only want to love you."</p>

<p>"But why?"</p>

<p>Driven to subterfuge, she stammered--</p>

<p>"Your father is a parson, and your mother wouldn' like you to marry</p>

<p>such as me.  She will want you to marry a lady."</p>

<p>"Nonsense--I have spoken to them both.  That was partly why I went</p>

<p>home."</p>

<p>"I feel I cannot--never, never!" she echoed.</p>

<p>"Is it too sudden to be asked thus, my Pretty?"</p>

<p>"Yes--I did not expect it."</p>

<p>"If you will let it pass, please, Tessy, I will give you time," he</p>

<p>said.  "It was very abrupt to come home and speak to you all at once.</p>

<p>I'll not allude to it again for a while."</p>

<p>She again took up the shining skimmer, held it beneath the pump, and</p>

<p>began anew.  But she could not, as at other times, hit the exact</p>

<p>under-surface of the cream with the delicate dexterity required, try</p>

<p>as she might; sometimes she was cutting down into the milk, sometimes</p>

<p>in the air.  She could hardly see, her eyes having filled with two</p>

<p>blurring tears drawn forth by a grief which, to this her best friend</p>

<p>and dear advocate, she could never explain.</p>

<p>"I can't skim--I can't!" she said, turning away from him.</p>

<p>Not to agitate and hinder her longer, the considerate Clare began</p>

<p>talking in a more general way:</p>

<p>You quite misapprehend my parents.  They are the most simple-mannered</p>

<p>people alive, and quite unambitious.  They are two of the few</p>

<p>remaining Evangelical school.  Tessy, are you an Evangelical?"</p>

<p>"I don't know."</p>

<p>"You go to church very regularly, and our parson here is not very</p>

<p>High, they tell me."</p>

<p>Tess's ideas on the views of the parish clergyman, whom she heard</p>

<p>every week, seemed to be rather more vague than Clare's, who had</p>

<p>never heard him at all.</p>

<p>"I wish I could fix my mind on what I hear there more firmly than I</p>

<p>do," she remarked as a safe generality.  "It is often a great sorrow</p>

<p>to me."</p>

<p>She spoke so unaffectedly that Angel was sure in his heart that his</p>

<p>father could not object to her on religious grounds, even though she</p>

<p>did not know whether her principles were High, Low or Broad.  He</p>

<p>himself knew that, in reality, the confused beliefs which she held,</p>

<p>apparently imbibed in childhood, were, if anything, Tractarian as to</p>

<p>phraseology, and Pantheistic as to essence.  Confused or otherwise,</p>

<p>to disturb them was his last desire:</p>

<p>      Leave thou thy sister, when she prays,</p>

<p>         Her early Heaven, her happy views;</p>

<p>         Nor thou with shadow'd hint confuse</p>

<p>      A life that leads melodious days.</p>

<p>He had occasionally thought the counsel less honest than musical; but</p>

<p>he gladly conformed to it now.</p>

<p>He spoke further of the incidents of his visit, of his father's mode</p>

<p>of life, of his zeal for his principles; she grew serener, and the</p>

<p>undulations disappeared from her skimming; as she finished one lead</p>

<p>after another he followed her, and drew the plugs for letting down</p>

<p>the milk.</p>

<p>"I fancied you looked a little downcast when you came in," she</p>

<p>ventured to observe, anxious to keep away from the subject of</p>

<p>herself.</p>

<p>"Yes--well, my father had been talking a good deal to me of his</p>

<p>troubles and difficulties, and the subject always tends to depress</p>

<p>me.  He is so zealous that he gets many snubs and buffetings from</p>

<p>people of a different way of thinking from himself, and I don't</p>

<p>like to hear of such humiliations to a man of his age, the more</p>

<p>particularly as I don't think earnestness does any good when carried</p>

<p>so far.  He has been telling me of a very unpleasant scene in</p>

<p>which he took part quite recently.  He went as the deputy of some</p>

<p>missionary society to preach in the neighbourhood of Trantridge, a</p>

<p>place forty miles from here, and made it his business to expostulate</p>

<p>with a lax young cynic he met with somewhere about there--son of some</p>

<p>landowner up that way--and who has a mother afflicted with blindness.</p>

<p>My father addressed himself to the gentleman point-blank, and there</p>

<p>was quite a disturbance.  It was very foolish of my father, I</p>

<p>must say, to intrude his conversation upon a stranger when the</p>

<p>probabilities were so obvious that it would be useless.  But whatever</p>

<p>he thinks to be his duty, that he'll do, in season or out of season;</p>

<p>and, of course, he makes many enemies, not only among the absolutely</p>

<p>vicious, but among the easy-going, who hate being bothered.  He says</p>

<p>he glories in what happened, and that good may be done indirectly;</p>

<p>but I wish he would not wear himself out now he is getting old, and</p>

<p>would leave such pigs to their wallowing."</p>

<p>Tess's look had grown hard and worn, and her ripe mouth tragical; but</p>

<p>she no longer showed any tremulousness.  Clare's revived thoughts of</p>

<p>his father prevented his noticing her particularly; and so they went</p>

<p>on down the white row of liquid rectangles till they had finished</p>

<p>and drained them off, when the other maids returned, and took their</p>

<p>pails, and Deb came to scald out the leads for the new milk.  As</p>

<p>Tess withdrew to go afield to the cows he said to her softly--</p>

<p>"And my question, Tessy?"</p>

<p>"O no--no!" replied she with grave hopelessness, as one who had</p>

<p>heard anew the turmoil of her own past in the allusion to Alec</p>

<p>d'Urberville. "It CAN'T be!"</p>

<p>She went out towards the mead, joining the other milkmaids with</p>

<p>a bound, as if trying to make the open air drive away her sad</p>

<p>constraint.  All the girls drew onward to the spot where the cows</p>

<p>were grazing in the farther mead, the bevy advancing with the bold</p>

<p>grace of wild animals--the reckless, unchastened motion of women</p>

<p>accustomed to unlimited space--in which they abandoned themselves to</p>

<p>the air as a swimmer to the wave.  It seemed natural enough to him</p>

<p>now that Tess was again in sight to choose a mate from unconstrained</p>

<p>Nature, and not from the abodes of Art.</p>

<p>XXVIII</p>

<p>Her refusal, though unexpected, did not permanently daunt Clare.</p>

<p>His experience of women was great enough for him to be aware that</p>

<p>the negative often meant nothing more than the preface to the</p>

<p>affirmative; and it was little enough for him not to know that in</p>

<p>the manner of the present negative there lay a great exception to</p>

<p>the dallyings of coyness.  That she had already permitted him to</p>

<p>make love to her he read as an additional assurance, not fully</p>

<p>trowing that in the fields and pastures to "sigh gratis" is by no</p>

<p>means deemed waste; love-making being here more often accepted</p>

<p>inconsiderately and for its own sweet sake than in the carking,</p>

<p>anxious homes of the ambitious, where a girl's craving for an</p>

<p>establishment paralyzes her healthy thought of a passion as an end.</p>

<p>"Tess, why did you say 'no' in such a positive way?" he asked her in</p>

<p>the course of a few days.</p>

<p>She started.</p>

<p>"Don't ask me.  I told you why--partly.  I am not good enough--not</p>

<p>worthy enough."</p>

<p>"How?  Not fine lady enough?"</p>

<p>"Yes--something like that," murmured she.  "Your friends would scorn</p>

<p>me."</p>

<p>"Indeed, you mistake them--my father and mother.  As for my brothers,</p>

<p>I don't care--"  He clasped his fingers behind her back to keep her</p>

<p>from slipping away.  "Now--you did not mean it, sweet?--I am sure you</p>

<p>did not!  You have made me so restless that I cannot read, or play,</p>

<p>or do anything.  I am in no hurry, Tess, but I want to know--to hear</p>

<p>from your own warm lips--that you will some day be mine--any time you</p>

<p>may choose; but some day?"</p>

<p>She could only shake her head and look away from him.</p>

<p>Clare regarded her attentively, conned the characters of her face as</p>

<p>if they had been hieroglyphics.  The denial seemed real.</p>

<p>"Then I ought not to hold you in this way--ought I?  I have no</p>

<p>right to you--no right to seek out where you are, or walk with you!</p>

<p>Honestly, Tess, do you love any other man?"</p>

<p>"How can you ask?" she said, with continued self-suppression.</p>

<p>"I almost know that you do not.  But then, why do you repulse me?"</p>

<p>"I don't repulse you.  I like you to--tell me you love me; and you</p>

<p>may always tell me so as you go about with me--and never offend me."</p>

<p>"But you will not accept me as a husband?"</p>

<p>"Ah--that's different--it is for your good, indeed, my dearest!</p>

<p>O, believe me, it is only for your sake!  I don't like to give</p>

<p>myself the great happiness o' promising to be yours in that</p>

<p>way--because--because I am SURE I ought not to do it."</p>

<p>"But you will make me happy!"</p>

<p>"Ah--you think so, but you don't know!"</p>

<p>At such times as this, apprehending the grounds of her refusal to be</p>

<p>her modest sense of incompetence in matters social and polite, he</p>

<p>would say that she was wonderfully well-informed and versatile--which</p>

<p>was certainly true, her natural quickness and her admiration for him</p>

<p>having led her to pick up his vocabulary, his accent, and fragments</p>

<p>of his knowledge, to a surprising extent.  After these tender</p>

<p>contests and her victory she would go away by herself under the</p>

<p>remotest cow, if at milking-time, or into the sedge or into her room,</p>

<p>if at a leisure interval, and mourn silently, not a minute after an</p>

<p>apparently phlegmatic negative.</p>

<p>The struggle was so fearful; her own heart was so strongly on the</p>

<p>side of his--two ardent hearts against one poor little conscience--</p>

<p>that she tried to fortify her resolution by every means in her power.</p>

<p>She had come to Talbothays with a made-up mind.  On no account could</p>

<p>she agree to a step which might afterwards cause bitter rueing to her</p>

<p>husband for his blindness in wedding her.  And she held that what her</p>

<p>conscience had decided for her when her mind was unbiassed ought not</p>

<p>to be overruled now.</p>

<p>"Why don't somebody tell him all about me?" she said.  "It was only</p>

<p>forty miles off--why hasn't it reached here?  Somebody must know!"</p>

<p>Yet nobody seemed to know; nobody told him.</p>

<p>For two or three days no more was said.  She guessed from the sad</p>

<p>countenances of her chamber companions that they regarded her not</p>

<p>only as the favourite, but as the chosen; but they could see for</p>

<p>themselves that she did not put herself in his way.</p>

<p>Tess had never before known a time in which the thread of her life</p>

<p>was so distinctly twisted of two strands, positive pleasure and</p>

<p>positive pain.  At the next cheese-making the pair were again left</p>

<p>alone together.  The dairyman himself had been lending a hand; but</p>

<p>Mr Crick, as well as his wife, seemed latterly to have acquired a</p>

<p>suspicion of mutual interest between these two; though they walked</p>

<p>so circumspectly that suspicion was but of the faintest. Anyhow, the</p>

<p>dairyman left them to themselves.</p>

<p>They were breaking up the masses of curd before putting them into</p>

<p>the vats.  The operation resembled the act of crumbling bread on a</p>

<p>large scale; and amid the immaculate whiteness of the curds Tess</p>

<p>Durbeyfield's hands showed themselves of the pinkness of the rose.</p>

<p>Angel, who was filling the vats with his handful, suddenly ceased,</p>

<p>and laid his hands flat upon hers.  Her sleeves were rolled far above</p>

<p>the elbow, and bending lower he kissed the inside vein of her soft</p>

<p>arm.</p>

<p>Although the early September weather was sultry, her arm, from</p>

<p>her dabbling in the curds, was as cold and damp to his mouth as a</p>

<p>new-gathered mushroom, and tasted of the whey.  But she was such</p>

<p>a sheaf of susceptibilities that her pulse was accelerated by the</p>

<p>touch, her blood driven to her finder-ends, and the cool arms</p>

<p>flushed hot.  Then, as though her heart had said, "Is coyness longer</p>

<p>necessary? Truth is truth between man and woman, as between man and</p>

<p>man," she lifted her eyes and they beamed devotedly into his, as her</p>

<p>lip rose in a tender half-smile.</p>

<p>"Do you know why I did that, Tess?" he said.</p>

<p>"Because you love me very much!"</p>

<p>"Yes, and as a preliminary to a new entreaty."</p>

<p>"Not AGAIN!"</p>

<p>She looked a sudden fear that her resistance might break down under</p>

<p>her own desire.</p>

<p>"O, Tessy!" he went on, "I CANNOT think why you are so tantalizing.</p>

<p>Why do you disappoint me so?  You seem almost like a coquette, upon</p>

<p>my life you do--a coquette of the first urban water!  They blow</p>

<p>hot and blow cold, just as you do, and it is the very last sort of</p>

<p>thing to expect to find in a retreat like Talbothays. ...  And yet,</p>

<p>dearest," he quickly added, observing now the remark had cut her, "I</p>

<p>know you to be the most honest, spotless creature that ever lived.</p>

<p>So how can I suppose you a flirt?  Tess, why don't you like the idea</p>

<p>of being my wife, if you love me as you seem to do?"</p>

<p>"I have never said I don't like the idea, and I never could say it;</p>

<p>because--it isn't true!"</p>

<p>The stress now getting beyond endurance, her lip quivered, and she</p>

<p>was obliged to go away.  Clare was so pained and perplexed that he</p>

<p>ran after and caught her in the passage.</p>

<p>"Tell me, tell me!" he said, passionately clasping her, in</p>

<p>forgetfulness of his curdy hands: "do tell me that you won't belong</p>

<p>to anybody but me!"</p>

<p>"I will, I will tell you!" she exclaimed.  "And I will give you a</p>

<p>complete answer, if you will let me go now. I will tell you my</p>

<p>experiences--all about myself--all!"</p>

<p>"Your experiences, dear; yes, certainly; any number."  He expressed</p>

<p>assent in loving satire, looking into her face.  "My Tess, no doubt,</p>

<p>almost as many experiences as that wild convolvulus out there on the</p>

<p>garden hedge, that opened itself this morning for the first time.</p>

<p>Tell me anything, but don't use that wretched expression any more</p>

<p>about not being worthy of me."</p>

<p>"I will try--not!  And I'll give you my reasons to-morrow--next</p>

<p>week."</p>

<p>"Say on Sunday?"</p>

<p>"Yes, on Sunday."</p>

<p>At last she got away, and did not stop in her retreat till she was in</p>

<p>the thicket of pollard willows at the lower side of the barton, where</p>

<p>she could be quite unseen.  Here Tess flung herself down upon the</p>

<p>rustling undergrowth of spear-grass, as upon a bed, and remained</p>

<p>crouching in palpitating misery broken by momentary shoots of joy,</p>

<p>which her fears about the ending could not altogether suppress.</p>

<p>In reality, she was drifting into acquiescence.  Every see-saw of her</p>

<p>breath, every wave of her blood, every pulse singing in her ears, was</p>

<p>a voice that joined with nature in revolt against her scrupulousness.</p>

<p>Reckless, inconsiderate acceptance of him; to close with him at the</p>

<p>altar, revealing nothing, and chancing discovery; to snatch ripe</p>

<p>pleasure before the iron teeth of pain could have time to shut upon</p>

<p>her: that was what love counselled; and in almost a terror of ecstasy</p>

<p>Tess divined that, despite her many months of lonely self-chastisement,</p>

<p>wrestlings, communings, schemes to lead a future of austere</p>

<p>isolation, love's counsel would prevail.</p>

<p>The afternoon advanced, and still she remained among the willows.</p>

<p>She heard the rattle of taking down the pails from the forked stands;</p>

<p>the "waow-waow!" which accompanied the getting together of the cows.</p>

<p>But she did not go to the milking.  They would see her agitation;</p>

<p>and the dairyman, thinking the cause to be love alone, would</p>

<p>good-naturedly tease her; and that harassment could not be borne.</p>

<p>Her lover must have guessed her overwrought state, and invented some</p>

<p>excuse for her non-appearance, for no inquiries were made or calls</p>

<p>given.  At half-past six the sun settled down upon the levels with</p>

<p>the aspect of a great forge in the heavens; and presently a monstrous</p>

<p>pumpkin-like moon arose on the other hand.  The pollard willows,</p>

<p>tortured out of their natural shape by incessant choppings, became</p>

<p>spiny-haired monsters as they stood up against it.  She went in and</p>

<p>upstairs without a light.</p>

<p>It was now Wednesday.  Thursday came, and Angel looked thoughtfully</p>

<p>at her from a distance, but intruded in no way upon her.  The indoor</p>

<p>milkmaids, Marian and the rest, seemed to guess that something</p>

<p>definite was afoot, for they did not force any remarks upon her in</p>

<p>the bedchamber.  Friday passed; Saturday.  To-morrow was the day.</p>

<p>"I shall give way--I shall say yes--I shall let myself marry</p>

<p>him--I cannot help it!" she jealously panted, with her hot face to</p>

<p>the pillow that night, on hearing one of the other girls sigh his</p>

<p>name in her sleep.  "I can't bear to let anybody have him but me!</p>

<p>Yet it is a wrong to him, and may kill him when he knows!  O my</p>

<p>heart--O--O--O!"</p>

<p>XXIX</p>

<p>"Now, who mid ye think I've heard news o' this morning?" said</p>

<p>Dairyman Crick, as he sat down to breakfast next day, with a riddling</p>

<p>gaze round upon the munching men and maids. "Now, just who mid ye</p>

<p>think?"</p>

<p>One guessed, and another guessed.  Mrs Crick did not guess, because</p>

<p>she knew already.</p>

<p>"Well," said the dairyman, "'tis that slack-twisted 'hore's-bird of a</p>

<p>feller, Jack Dollop.  He's lately got married to a widow-woman."</p>

<p>"Not Jack Dollop?  A villain--to think o' that!" said a milker.</p>

<p>The name entered quickly into Tess Durbeyfield's consciousness, for</p>

<p>it was the name of the lover who had wronged his sweetheart, and had</p>

<p>afterwards been so roughly used by the young woman's mother in the</p>

<p>butter-churn.</p>

<p>"And had he married the valiant matron's daughter, as he promised?"</p>

<p>asked Angel Clare absently, as he turned over the newspaper he was</p>

<p>reading at the little table to which he was always banished by Mrs</p>

<p>Crick, in her sense of his gentility.</p>

<p>"Not he, sir.  Never meant to," replied the dairyman. "As I say, 'tis</p>

<p>a widow-woman, and she had money, it seems--fifty poun' a year or so;</p>

<p>and that was all he was after.  They were married in a great hurry;</p>

<p>and then she told him that by marrying she had lost her fifty poun'</p>

<p>a year.  Just fancy the state o' my gentleman's mind at that news!</p>

<p>Never such a cat-and-dog life as they've been leading ever since!</p>

<p>Serves him well beright.  But onluckily the poor woman gets the worst</p>

<p>o't."</p>

<p>"Well, the silly body should have told en sooner that the ghost of</p>

<p>her first man would trouble him," said Mrs Crick.</p>

<p>"Ay, ay," responded the dairyman indecisively.  "Still, you can see</p>

<p>exactly how 'twas.  She wanted a home, and didn't like to run the</p>

<p>risk of losing him.  Don't ye think that was something like it,</p>

<p>maidens?"</p>

<p>He glanced towards the row of girls.</p>

<p>"She ought to ha' told him just before they went to church, when he</p>

<p>could hardly have backed out," exclaimed Marian.</p>

<p>"Yes, she ought," agreed Izz.</p>

<p>"She must have seen what he was after, and should ha' refused him,"</p>

<p>cried Retty spasmodically.</p>

<p>"And what do you say, my dear?" asked the dairyman of Tess.</p>

<p>"I think she ought--to have told him the true state of things--or</p>

<p>else refused him--I don't know," replied Tess, the bread-and-butter</p>

<p>choking her.</p>

<p>"Be cust if I'd have done either o't," said Beck Knibbs, a married</p>

<p>helper from one of the cottages.  "All's fair in love and war.  I'd</p>

<p>ha' married en just as she did, and if he'd said two words to me</p>

<p>about not telling him beforehand anything whatsomdever about my first</p>

<p>chap that I hadn't chose to tell, I'd ha' knocked him down wi' the</p>

<p>rolling-pin--a scram little feller like he!  Any woman could do it."</p>

<p>The laughter which followed this sally was supplemented only by a</p>

<p>sorry smile, for form's sake, from Tess.  What was comedy to them was</p>

<p>tragedy to her; and she could hardly bear their mirth.  She soon rose</p>

<p>from table, and, with an impression that Clare would soon follow her,</p>

<p>went along a little wriggling path, now stepping to one side of the</p>

<p>irrigating channels, and now to the other, till she stood by the main</p>

<p>stream of the Var.  Men had been cutting the water-weeds higher up</p>

<p>the river, and masses of them were floating past her--moving islands</p>

<p>of green crow-foot, whereon she might almost have ridden; long locks</p>

<p>of which weed had lodged against the piles driven to keep the cows</p>

<p>from crossing.</p>

<p>Yes, there was the pain of it.  This question of a woman telling her</p>

<p>story--the heaviest of crosses to herself--seemed but amusement to</p>

<p>others.  It was as if people should laugh at martyrdom.</p>

<p>"Tessy!" came from behind her, and Clare sprang across the gully,</p>

<p>alighting beside her feet.  "My wife--soon!"</p>

<p>"No, no; I cannot.  For your sake, O Mr Clare; for your sake, I say</p>

<p>no!"</p>

<p>"Tess!"</p>

<p>"Still I say no!" she repeated.</p>

<p>Not expecting this, he had put his arm lightly round her waist the</p>

<p>moment after speaking, beneath her hanging tail of hair.  (The</p>

<p>younger dairymaids, including Tess, breakfasted with their hair loose</p>

<p>on Sunday mornings before building it up extra high for attending</p>

<p>church, a style they could not adopt when milking with their heads</p>

<p>against the cows.)  If she had said "Yes" instead of "No" he</p>

<p>would have kissed her; it had evidently been his intention; but</p>

<p>her determined negative deterred his scrupulous heart.  Their</p>

<p>condition of domiciliary comradeship put her, as the woman, to such</p>

<p>disadvantage by its enforced intercourse, that he felt it unfair to</p>

<p>her to exercise any pressure of blandishment which he might have</p>

<p>honestly employed had she been better able to avoid him.  He released</p>

<p>her momentarily-imprisoned waist, and withheld the kiss.</p>

<p>It all turned on that release.  What had given her strength to refuse</p>

<p>him this time was solely the tale of the widow told by the dairyman;</p>

<p>and that would have been overcome in another moment.  But Angel said</p>

<p>no more; his face was perplexed; he went away.</p>

<p>Day after day they met--somewhat less constantly than before; and</p>

<p>thus two or three weeks went by.  The end of September drew near, and</p>

<p>she could see in his eye that he might ask her again.</p>

<p>His plan of procedure was different now--as though he had made up</p>

<p>his mind that her negatives were, after all, only coyness and youth</p>

<p>startled by the novelty of the proposal.  The fitful evasiveness of</p>

<p>her manner when the subject was under discussion countenanced the</p>

<p>idea.  So he played a more coaxing game; and while never going beyond</p>

<p>words, or attempting the renewal of caresses, he did his utmost</p>

<p>orally.</p>

<p>In this way Clare persistently wooed her in undertones like that of</p>

<p>the purling milk--at the cow's side, at skimmings, at butter-makings,</p>

<p>at cheese-makings, among broody poultry, and among farrowing pigs--as</p>

<p>no milkmaid was ever wooed before by such a man.</p>

<p>Tess knew that she must break down.  Neither a religious sense of a</p>

<p>certain moral validity in the previous union nor a conscientious wish</p>

<p>for candour could hold out against it much longer.  She loved him so</p>

<p>passionately, and he was so godlike in her eyes; and being, though</p>

<p>untrained, instinctively refined, her nature cried for his tutelary</p>

<p>guidance.  And thus, though Tess kept repeating to herself, "I can</p>

<p>never be his wife," the words were vain.  A proof of her weakness lay</p>

<p>in the very utterance of what calm strength would not have taken the</p>

<p>trouble to formulate.  Every sound of his voice beginning on the old</p>

<p>subject stirred her with a terrifying bliss, and she coveted the</p>

<p>recantation she feared.</p>

<p>His manner was--what man's is not?--so much that of one who would</p>

<p>love and cherish and defend her under any conditions, changes,</p>

<p>charges, or revelations, that her gloom lessened as she basked in it.</p>

<p>The season meanwhile was drawing onward to the equinox, and though</p>

<p>it was still fine, the days were much shorter.  The dairy had again</p>

<p>worked by morning candlelight for a long time; and a fresh renewal</p>

<p>of Clare's pleading occurred one morning between three and four.</p>

<p>She had run up in her bedgown to his door to call him as usual;</p>

<p>then had gone back to dress and call the others; and in ten minutes</p>

<p>was walking to the head of the stairs with the candle in her</p>

<p>hand.  At the same moment he came down his steps from above in his</p>

<p>shirt-sleeves and put his arm across the stairway.</p>

<p>"Now, Miss Flirt, before you go down," he said peremptorily. "It is a</p>

<p>fortnight since I spoke, and this won't do any longer.  You MUST tell</p>

<p>me what you mean, or I shall have to leave this house.  My door was</p>

<p>ajar just now, and I saw you.  For your own safety I must go.  You</p>

<p>don't know.  Well?  Is it to be yes at last?"</p>

<p>"I am only just up, Mr Clare, and it is too early to take me to</p>

<p>task!" she pouted.  "You need not call me Flirt.  'Tis cruel and</p>

<p>untrue.  Wait till by and by.  Please wait till by and by!  I will</p>

<p>really think seriously about it between now and then.  Let me go</p>

<p>downstairs!"</p>

<p>She looked a little like what he said she was as, holding the candle</p>

<p>sideways, she tried to smile away the seriousness of her words.</p>

<p>"Call me Angel, then, and not Mr Clare."</p>

<p>"Angel."</p>

<p>"Angel dearest--why not?"</p>

<p>"'Twould mean that I agree, wouldn't it?"</p>

<p>"It would only mean that you love me, even if you cannot marry me;</p>

<p>and you were so good as to own that long ago."</p>

<p>"Very well, then, 'Angel dearest', if I MUST," she murmured, looking</p>

<p>at her candle, a roguish curl coming upon her mouth, notwithstanding</p>

<p>her suspense.</p>

<p>Clare had resolved never to kiss her until he had obtained her</p>

<p>promise; but somehow, as Tess stood there in her prettily tucked-up</p>

<p>milking gown, her hair carelessly heaped upon her head till there</p>

<p>should be leisure to arrange it when skimming and milking were done,</p>

<p>he broke his resolve, and brought his lips to her cheek for one</p>

<p>moment.  She passed downstairs very quickly, never looking back at</p>

<p>him or saying another word.  The other maids were already down,</p>

<p>and the subject was not pursued.  Except Marian, they all looked</p>

<p>wistfully and suspiciously at the pair, in the sad yellow rays which</p>

<p>the morning candles emitted in contrast with the first cold signals</p>

<p>of the dawn without.</p>

<p>When skimming was done--which, as the milk diminished with the</p>

<p>approach of autumn, was a lessening process day by day--Retty and</p>

<p>the rest went out.  The lovers followed them.</p>

<p>"Our tremulous lives are so different from theirs, are they not?" he</p>

<p>musingly observed to her, as he regarded the three figures tripping</p>

<p>before him through the frigid pallor of opening day.</p>

<p>"Not so very different, I think," she said.</p>

<p>"Why do you think that?"</p>

<p>"There are very few women's lives that are not--tremulous," Tess</p>

<p>replied, pausing over the new word as if it impressed her.  "There's</p>

<p>more in those three than you think."</p>

<p>"What is in them?"</p>

<p>"Almost either of 'em," she began, "would make--perhaps would</p>

<p>make--a properer wife than I.  And perhaps they love you as well</p>

<p>as I--almost."</p>

<p>"O, Tessy!"</p>

<p>There were signs that it was an exquisite relief to her to hear the</p>

<p>impatient exclamation, though she had resolved so intrepidly to let</p>

<p>generosity make one bid against herself.  That was now done, and she</p>

<p>had not the power to attempt self-immolation a second time then.</p>

<p>They were joined by a milker from one of the cottages, and no more</p>

<p>was said on that which concerned them so deeply.  But Tess knew that</p>

<p>this day would decide it.</p>

<p>In the afternoon several of the dairyman's household and assistants</p>

<p>went down to the meads as usual, a long way from the dairy, where</p>

<p>many of the cows were milked without being driven home.  The</p>

<p>supply was getting less as the animals advanced in calf, and the</p>

<p>supernumerary milkers of the lush green season had been dismissed.</p>

<p>The work progressed leisurely.  Each pailful was poured into tall</p>

<p>cans that stood in a large spring-waggon which had been brought</p>

<p>upon the scene; and when they were milked, the cows trailed away.</p>

<p>Dairyman Crick, who was there with the rest, his wrapper gleaming</p>

<p>miraculously white against a leaden evening sky, suddenly looked</p>

<p>at his heavy watch.</p>

<p>"Why, 'tis later than I thought," he said.  "Begad!  We shan't be</p>

<p>soon enough with this milk at the station, if we don't mind.  There's</p>

<p>no time to-day to take it home and mix it with the bulk afore sending</p>

<p>off.  It must go to station straight from here.  Who'll drive it</p>

<p>across?"</p>

<p>Mr Clare volunteered to do so, though it was none of his business,</p>

<p>asking Tess to accompany him.  The evening, though sunless, had</p>

<p>been warm and muggy for the season, and Tess had come out with</p>

<p>her milking-hood only, naked-armed and jacketless; certainly not</p>

<p>dressed for a drive.  She therefore replied by glancing over her</p>

<p>scant habiliments; but Clare gently urged her.  She assented by</p>

<p>relinquishing her pail and stool to the dairyman to take home, and</p>

<p>mounted the spring-waggon beside Clare.</p>

<p>XXX</p>

<p>In the diminishing daylight they went along the level roadway through</p>

<p>the meads, which stretched away into gray miles, and were backed in</p>

<p>the extreme edge of distance by the swarthy and abrupt slopes of</p>

<p>Egdon Heath.  On its summit stood clumps and stretches of fir-trees,</p>

<p>whose notched tips appeared like battlemented towers crowning</p>

<p>black-fronted castles of enchantment.</p>

<p>They were so absorbed in the sense of being close to each other that</p>

<p>they did not begin talking for a long while, the silence being broken</p>

<p>only by the clucking of the milk in the tall cans behind them.</p>

<p>The lane they followed was so solitary that the hazel nuts had</p>

<p>remained on the boughs till they slipped from their shells, and the</p>

<p>blackberries hung in heavy clusters.  Every now and then Angel would</p>

<p>fling the lash of his whip round one of these, pluck it off, and give</p>

<p>it to his companion.</p>

<p>The dull sky soon began to tell its meaning by sending down</p>

<p>herald-drops of rain, and the stagnant air of the day changed into</p>

<p>a fitful breeze which played about their faces.  The quick-silvery</p>

<p>glaze on the rivers and pools vanished; from broad mirrors of light</p>

<p>they changed to lustreless sheets of lead, with a surface like a</p>

<p>rasp.  But that spectacle did not affect her preoccupation.  Her</p>

<p>countenance, a natural carnation slightly embrowned by the season,</p>

<p>had deepened its tinge with the beating of the rain-drops; and her</p>

<p>hair, which the pressure of the cows' flanks had, as usual, caused to</p>

<p>tumble down from its fastenings and stray beyond the curtain of her</p>

<p>calico bonnet, was made clammy by the moisture, till it hardly was</p>

<p>better than seaweed.</p>

<p>"I ought not to have come, I suppose," she murmured, looking at the</p>

<p>sky.</p>

<p>"I am sorry for the rain," said he.  "But how glad I am to have you</p>

<p>here!"</p>

<p>Remote Egdon disappeared by degree behind the liquid gauze.  The</p>

<p>evening grew darker, and the roads being crossed by gates, it was</p>

<p>not safe to drive faster than at a walking pace.  The air was rather</p>

<p>chill.</p>

<p>"I am so afraid you will get cold, with nothing upon your arms and</p>

<p>shoulders," he said.  "Creep close to me, and perhaps the drizzle</p>

<p>won't hurt you much.  I should be sorrier still if I did not think</p>

<p>that the rain might be helping me."</p>

<p>She imperceptibly crept closer, and he wrapped round them both a</p>

<p>large piece of sail-cloth, which was sometimes used to keep the sun</p>

<p>off the milk-cans.  Tess held it from slipping off him as well as</p>

<p>herself, Clare's hands being occupied.</p>

<p>"Now we are all right again.  Ah--no we are not!  It runs down into</p>

<p>my neck a little, and it must still more into yours.  That's better.</p>

<p>Your arms are like wet marble, Tess.  Wipe them in the cloth.  Now,</p>

<p>if you stay quiet, you will not get another drop.  Well, dear--about</p>

<p>that question of mine--that long-standing question?"</p>

<p>The only reply that he could hear for a little while was the smack of</p>

<p>the horse's hoofs on the moistening road, and the cluck of the milk</p>

<p>in the cans behind them.</p>

<p>"Do you remember what you said?"</p>

<p>"I do," she replied.</p>

<p>"Before we get home, mind."</p>

<p>"I'll try."</p>

<p>He said no more then.  As they drove on, the fragment of an old manor</p>

<p>house of Caroline date rose against the sky, and was in due course</p>

<p>passed and left behind.</p>

<p>"That," he observed, to entertain her, "is an interesting old</p>

<p>place--one of the several seats which belonged to an ancient Norman</p>

<p>family formerly of great influence in this county, the d'Urbervilles.</p>

<p>I never pass one of their residences without thinking of them.  There</p>

<p>is something very sad in the extinction of a family of renown, even</p>

<p>if it was fierce, domineering, feudal renown."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Tess.</p>

<p>They crept along towards a point in the expanse of shade just at hand</p>

<p>at which a feeble light was beginning to assert its presence, a spot</p>

<p>where, by day, a fitful white streak of steam at intervals upon the</p>

<p>dark green background denoted intermittent moments of contact between</p>

<p>their secluded world and modern life.  Modern life stretched out its</p>

<p>steam feeler to this point three or four times a day, touched the</p>

<p>native existences, and quickly withdrew its feeler again, as if what</p>

<p>it touched had been uncongenial.</p>

<p>They reached the feeble light, which came from the smoky lamp of a</p>

<p>little railway station; a poor enough terrestrial star, yet in one</p>

<p>sense of more importance to Talbothays Dairy and mankind than the</p>

<p>celestial ones to which it stood in such humiliating contrast.  The</p>

<p>cans of new milk were unladen in the rain, Tess getting a little</p>

<p>shelter from a neighbouring holly tree.</p>

<p>Then there was the hissing of a train, which drew up almost silently</p>

<p>upon the wet rails, and the milk was rapidly swung can by can into</p>

<p>the truck.  The light of the engine flashed for a second upon Tess</p>

<p>Durbeyfield's figure, motionless under the great holly tree.  No</p>

<p>object could have looked more foreign to the gleaming cranks and</p>

<p>wheels than this unsophisticated girl, with the round bare arms, the</p>

<p>rainy face and hair, the suspended attitude of a friendly leopard at</p>

<p>pause, the print gown of no date or fashion, and the cotton bonnet</p>

<p>drooping on her brow.</p>

<p>She mounted again beside her lover, with a mute obedience</p>

<p>characteristic of impassioned natures at times, and when they had</p>

<p>wrapped themselves up over head and ears in the sailcloth again, they</p>

<p>plunged back into the now thick night.  Tess was so receptive that</p>

<p>the few minutes of contact with the whirl of material progress</p>

<p>lingered in her thought.</p>

<p>"Londoners will drink it at their breakfasts to-morrow, won't they?"</p>

<p>she asked.  "Strange people that we have never seen."</p>

<p>"Yes--I suppose they will.  Though not as we send it.  When its</p>

<p>strength has been lowered, so that it may not get up into their</p>

<p>heads."</p>

<p>"Noble men and noble women, ambassadors and centurions, ladies and</p>

<p>tradeswomen, and babies who have never seen a cow."</p>

<p>"Well, yes; perhaps; particularly centurions."</p>

<p>"Who don't know anything of us, and where it comes from; or think how</p>

<p>we two drove miles across the moor to-night in the rain that it might</p>

<p>reach 'em in time?"</p>

<p>"We did not drive entirely on account of these precious Londoners; we</p>

<p>drove a little on our own--on account of that anxious matter which</p>

<p>you will, I am sure, set at rest, dear Tess.  Now, permit me to put</p>

<p>it in this way.  You belong to me already, you know; your heart, I</p>

<p>mean. Does it not?"</p>

<p>"You know as well as I.  O yes--yes!"</p>

<p>"Then, if your heart does, why not your hand?"</p>

<p>"My only reason was on account of you--on account of a question.  I</p>

<p>have something to tell you--"</p>

<p>"But suppose it to be entirely for my happiness, and my worldly</p>

<p>convenience also?"</p>

<p>"O yes; if it is for your happiness and worldly convenience.  But my</p>

<p>life before I came here--I want--"</p>

<p>"Well, it is for my convenience as well as my happiness.  If I have a</p>

<p>very large farm, either English or colonial, you will be invaluable</p>

<p>as a wife to me; better than a woman out of the largest mansion in</p>

<p>the country.  So please--please, dear Tessy, disabuse your mind of</p>

<p>the feeling that you will stand in my way."</p>

<p>"But my history.  I want you to know it--you must let me tell</p>

<p>you--you will not like me so well!"</p>

<p>"Tell it if you wish to, dearest.  This precious history then.  Yes,</p>

<p>I was born at so and so, Anno Domini--"</p>

<p>"I was born at Marlott," she said, catching at his words as a help,</p>

<p>lightly as they were spoken.  "And I grew up there. And I was in the</p>

<p>Sixth Standard when I left school, and they said I had great aptness,</p>

<p>and should make a good teacher, so it was settled that I should</p>

<p>be one.  But there was trouble in my family; father was not very</p>

<p>industrious, and he drank a little."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes.  Poor child!  Nothing new."  He pressed her more closely</p>

<p>to his side.</p>

<p>"And then--there is something very unusual about it--about me.  I--I</p>

<p>was--"</p>

<p>Tess's breath quickened.</p>

<p>"Yes, dearest.  Never mind."</p>

<p>"I--I--am not a Durbeyfield, but a d'Urberville--a descendant of the</p>

<p>same family as those that owned the old house we passed.  And--we are</p>

<p>all gone to nothing!"</p>

<p>"A d'Urberville!--Indeed!  And is that all the trouble, dear Tess?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she answered faintly.</p>

<p>"Well--why should I love you less after knowing this?"</p>

<p>"I was told by the dairyman that you hated old families."</p>

<p>He laughed.</p>

<p>"Well, it is true, in one sense.  I do hate the aristocratic</p>

<p>principle of blood before everything, and do think that as reasoners</p>

<p>the only pedigrees we ought to respect are those spiritual ones of</p>

<p>the wise and virtuous, without regard to corporal paternity.  But</p>

<p>I am extremely interested in this news--you can have no idea how</p>

<p>interested I am!  Are you not interested yourself in being one of</p>

<p>that well-known line?"</p>

<p>"No.  I have thought it sad--especially since coming here, and</p>

<p>knowing that many of the hills and fields I see once belonged to</p>

<p>my father's people.  But other hills and field belonged to Retty's</p>

<p>people, and perhaps others to Marian's, so that I don't value it</p>

<p>particularly."</p>

<p>"Yes--it is surprising how many of the present tillers of the soil</p>

<p>were once owners of it, and I sometimes wonder that a certain school</p>

<p>of politicians don't make capital of the circumstance; but they don't</p>

<p>seem to know it...  I wonder that I did not see the resemblance of</p>

<p>your name to d'Urberville, and trace the manifest corruption.  And</p>

<p>this was the carking secret!"</p>

<p>She had not told.  At the last moment her courage had failed her;</p>

<p>she feared his blame for not telling him sooner; and her instinct</p>

<p>of self-preservation was stronger than her candour.</p>

<p>"Of course," continued the unwitting Clare, "I should have been glad</p>

<p>to know you to be descended exclusively from the long-suffering,</p>

<p>dumb, unrecorded rank and file of the English nation, and not from</p>

<p>the self-seeking few who made themselves powerful at the expense of</p>

<p>the rest.  But I am corrupted away from that by my affection for you,</p>

<p>Tess (he laughed as he spoke), and made selfish likewise.  For your</p>

<p>own sake I rejoice in your descent.  Society is hopelessly snobbish,</p>

<p>and this fact of your extraction may make an appreciable difference</p>

<p>to its acceptance of you as my wife, after I have made you the</p>

<p>well-read woman that I mean to make you.  My mother too, poor soul,</p>

<p>will think so much better of you on account of it.  Tess, you must</p>

<p>spell your name correctly--d'Urberville--from this very day."</p>

<p>"I like the other way rather best."</p>

<p>"But you MUST, dearest!  Good heavens, why dozens of mushroom</p>

<p>millionaires would jump at such a possession!  By the bye, there's</p>

<p>one of that kidney who has taken the name--where have I heard of</p>

<p>him?--Up in the neighbourhood of The Chase, I think.  Why, he is the</p>

<p>very man who had that rumpus with my father I told you of.  What an</p>

<p>odd coincidence!"</p>

<p>"Angel, I think I would rather not take the name!  It is unlucky,</p>

<p>perhaps!"</p>

<p>She was agitated.</p>

<p>"Now then, Mistress Teresa d'Urberville, I have you.  Take my name,</p>

<p>and so you will escape yours!  The secret is out, so why should you</p>

<p>any longer refuse me?"</p>

<p>"If it is SURE to make you happy to have me as your wife, and you</p>

<p>feel that you do wish to marry me, VERY, VERY much--"</p>

<p>"I do, dearest, of course!"</p>

<p>"I mean, that it is only your wanting me very much, and being hardly</p>

<p>able to keep alive without me, whatever my offences, that would make</p>

<p>me feel I ought to say I will."</p>

<p>"You will--you do say it, I know!  You will be mine for ever and</p>

<p>ever."</p>

<p>He clasped her close and kissed her.</p>

<p>"Yes!"</p>

<p>She had no sooner said it than she burst into a dry hard sobbing, so</p>

<p>violent that it seemed to rend her.  Tess was not a hysterical girl</p>

<p>by any means, and he was surprised.</p>

<p>"Why do you cry, dearest?"</p>

<p>"I can't tell--quite!--I am so glad to think--of being yours, and</p>

<p>making you happy!"</p>

<p>"But this does not seem very much like gladness, my Tessy!"</p>

<p>"I mean--I cry because I have broken down in my vow!  I said I would</p>

<p>die unmarried!"</p>

<p>"But, if you love me you would like me to be your husband?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, yes!  But O, I sometimes wish I had never been born!"</p>

<p>"Now, my dear Tess, if I did not know that you are very much excited,</p>

<p>and very inexperienced, I should say that remark was not very</p>

<p>complimentary.  How came you to wish that if you care for me?  Do you</p>

<p>care for me?  I wish you would prove it in some way."</p>

<p>"How can I prove it more than I have done?" she cried, in a</p>

<p>distraction of tenderness.  "Will this prove it more?"</p>

<p>She clasped his neck, and for the first time Clare learnt what an</p>

<p>impassioned woman's kisses were like upon the lips of one whom she</p>

<p>loved with all her heart and soul, as Tess loved him.</p>

<p>"There--now do you believe?" she asked, flushed, and wiping her eyes.</p>

<p>"Yes. I never really doubted--never, never!"</p>

<p>So they drove on through the gloom, forming one bundle inside the</p>

<p>sail-cloth, the horse going as he would, and the rain driving against</p>

<p>them.  She had consented.  She might as well have agreed at first.</p>

<p>The "appetite for joy" which pervades all creation, that tremendous</p>

<p>force which sways humanity to its purpose, as the tide sways the</p>

<p>helpless weed, was not to be controlled by vague lucubrations over</p>

<p>the social rubric.</p>

<p>"I must write to my mother," she said.  "You don't mind my doing</p>

<p>that?"</p>

<p>"Of course not, dear child.  You are a child to me, Tess, not to know</p>

<p>how very proper it is to write to your mother at such a time, and how</p>

<p>wrong it would be in me to object.  Where does she live?"</p>

<p>"At the same place--Marlott.  On the further side of Blackmoor Vale."</p>

<p>"Ah, then I HAVE seen you before this summer--"</p>

<p>"Yes; at that dance on the green; but you would not dance with me.</p>

<p>O, I hope that is of no ill-omen for us now!"</p>

<p>XXXI</p>

<p>Tess wrote a most touching and urgent letter to her mother the very</p>

<p>next day, and by the end of the week a response to her communication</p>

<p>arrived in Joan Durbeyfield's wandering last-century hand.</p>

<p>   DEAR TESS,--</p>

<p>   J write these few lines Hoping they will find you well,</p>

<p>   as they leave me at Present, thank God for it.  Dear</p>

<p>   Tess, we are all glad to Hear that you are going really</p>

<p>   to be married soon.  But with respect to your question,</p>

<p>   Tess, J say between ourselves, quite private but very</p>

<p>   strong, that on no account do you say a word of your</p>

<p>   Bygone Trouble to him.  J did not tell everything</p>

<p>   to your Father, he being so Proud on account of his</p>

<p>   Respectability, which, perhaps, your Intended is</p>

<p>   the same.  Many a woman--some of the Highest in the</p>

<p>   Land--have had a Trouble in their time; and why should</p>

<p>   you Trumpet yours when others don't Trumpet theirs?  No</p>

<p>   girl would be such a Fool, specially as it is so long</p>

<p>   ago, and not your Fault at all.  J shall answer the</p>

<p>   same if you ask me fifty times.  Besides, you must bear</p>

<p>   in mind that, knowing it to be your Childish Nature to</p>

<p>   tell all that's in your heart--so simple!--J made you</p>

<p>   promise me never to let it out by Word or Deed, having</p>

<p>   your Welfare in my Mind; and you most solemnly did</p>

<p>   promise it going from this Door.  J have not named</p>

<p>   either that Question or your coming marriage to your</p>

<p>   Father, as he would blab it everywhere, poor Simple</p>

<p>   Man.</p>

<p>   Dear Tess, keep up your Spirits, and we mean to send</p>

<p>   you a Hogshead of Cyder for you Wedding, knowing there</p>

<p>   is not much in your parts, and thin Sour Stuff what</p>

<p>   there is.  So no more at present, and with kind love</p>

<p>   to your Young Man.--From your affectte. Mother,</p>

<p>   J. DURBEYFIELD</p>

<p>"O mother, mother!" murmured Tess.</p>

<p>She was recognizing how light was the touch of events the most</p>

<p>oppressive upon Mrs Durbeyfield's elastic spirit.  Her mother did not</p>

<p>see life as Tess saw it.  That haunting episode of bygone days was</p>

<p>to her mother but a passing accident.  But perhaps her mother was</p>

<p>right as to the course to be followed, whatever she might be in her</p>

<p>reasons.  Silence seemed, on the face of it, best for her adored</p>

<p>one's happiness: silence it should be.</p>

<p>Thus steadied by a command from the only person in the world who had</p>

<p>any shadow of right to control her action, Tess grew calmer.  The</p>

<p>responsibility was shifted, and her heart was lighter than it had</p>

<p>been for weeks.  The days of declining autumn which followed her</p>

<p>assent, beginning with the month of October, formed a season through</p>

<p>which she lived in spiritual altitudes more nearly approaching</p>

<p>ecstasy than any other period of her life.</p>

<p>There was hardly a touch of earth in her love for Clare.  To her</p>

<p>sublime trustfulness he was all that goodness could be--knew all that</p>

<p>a guide, philosopher, and friend should know.  She thought every line</p>

<p>in the contour of his person the perfection of masculine beauty, his</p>

<p>soul the soul of a saint, his intellect that of a seer.  The wisdom</p>

<p>of her love for him, as love, sustained her dignity; she seemed to be</p>

<p>wearing a crown.  The compassion of his love for her, as she saw it,</p>

<p>made her lift up her heart to him in devotion.  He would sometimes</p>

<p>catch her large, worshipful eyes, that had no bottom to them looking</p>

<p>at him from their depths, as if she saw something immortal before</p>

<p>her.</p>

<p>She dismissed the past--trod upon it and put it out, as one treads on</p>

<p>a coal that is smouldering and dangerous.</p>

<p>She had not known that men could be so disinterested, chivalrous,</p>

<p>protective, in their love for women as he.  Angel Clare was far from</p>

<p>all that she thought him in this respect; absurdly far, indeed;</p>

<p>but he was, in truth, more spiritual than animal; he had himself</p>

<p>well in hand, and was singularly free from grossness.  Though not</p>

<p>cold-natured, he was rather bright than hot--less Byronic than</p>

<p>Shelleyan; could love desperately, but with a love more especially</p>

<p>inclined to the imaginative and ethereal; it was a fastidious emotion</p>

<p>which could jealously guard the loved one against his very self.</p>

<p>This amazed and enraptured Tess, whose slight experiences had been so</p>

<p>infelicitous till now; and in her reaction from indignation against</p>

<p>the male sex she swerved to excess of honour for Clare.</p>

<p>They unaffectedly sought each other's company; in her honest faith</p>

<p>she did not disguise her desire to be with him.  The sum of her</p>

<p>instincts on this matter, if clearly stated, would have been that the</p>

<p>elusive quality of her sex which attracts men in general might be</p>

<p>distasteful to so perfect a man after an avowal of love, since it</p>

<p>must in its very nature carry with it a suspicion of art.</p>

<p>The country custom of unreserved comradeship out of doors during</p>

<p>betrothal was the only custom she knew, and to her it had no</p>

<p>strangeness; though it seemed oddly anticipative to Clare till he</p>

<p>saw how normal a thing she, in common with all the other dairy-folk,</p>

<p>regarded it.  Thus, during this October month of wonderful afternoons</p>

<p>they roved along the meads by creeping paths which followed the</p>

<p>brinks of trickling tributary brooks, hopping across by little wooden</p>

<p>bridges to the other side, and back again.  They were never out of</p>

<p>the sound of some purling weir, whose buzz accompanied their own</p>

<p>murmuring, while the beams of the sun, almost as horizontal as the</p>

<p>mead itself, formed a pollen of radiance over the landscape.  They</p>

<p>saw tiny blue fogs in the shadows of trees and hedges, all the time</p>

<p>that there was bright sunshine elsewhere.  The sun was so near the</p>

<p>ground, and the sward so flat, that the shadows of Clare and Tess</p>

<p>would stretch a quarter of a mile ahead of them, like two long</p>

<p>fingers pointing afar to where the green alluvial reaches abutted</p>

<p>against the sloping sides of the vale.</p>

<p>Men were at work here and there--for it was the season for "taking</p>

<p>up" the meadows, or digging the little waterways clear for the winter</p>

<p>irrigation, and mending their banks where trodden down by the cows.</p>

<p>The shovelfuls of loam, black as jet, brought there by the river</p>

<p>when it was as wide as the whole valley, were an essence of soils,</p>

<p>pounded champaigns of the past, steeped, refined, and subtilized to</p>

<p>extraordinary richness, out of which came all the fertility of the</p>

<p>mead, and of the cattle grazing there.</p>

<p>Clare hardily kept his arm round her waist in sight of these</p>

<p>watermen, with the air of a man who was accustomed to public</p>

<p>dalliance, though actually as shy as she who, with lips parted and</p>

<p>eyes askance on the labourers, wore the look of a wary animal the</p>

<p>while.</p>

<p>"You are not ashamed of owning me as yours before them!" she said</p>

<p>gladly.</p>

<p>"O no!"</p>

<p>"But if it should reach the ears of your friends at Emminster that</p>

<p>you are walking about like this with me, a milkmaid--"</p>

<p>"The most bewitching milkmaid ever seen."</p>

<p>"They might feel it a hurt to their dignity."</p>

<p>"My dear girl--a d'Urberville hurt the dignity of a Clare!  It is a</p>

<p>grand card to play--that of your belonging to such a family, and I</p>

<p>am reserving it for a grand effect when we are married, and have</p>

<p>the proofs of your descent from Parson Tringham.  Apart from that,</p>

<p>my future is to be totally foreign to my family--it will not affect</p>

<p>even the surface of their lives.  We shall leave this part of</p>

<p>England--perhaps England itself--and what does it matter how people</p>

<p>regard us here?  You will like going, will you not?"</p>

<p>She could answer no more than a bare affirmative, so great was the</p>

<p>emotion aroused in her at the thought of going through the world with</p>

<p>him as his own familiar friend.  Her feelings almost filled her ears</p>

<p>like a babble of waves, and surged up to her eyes.  She put her hand</p>

<p>in his, and thus they went on, to a place where the reflected sun</p>

<p>glared up from the river, under a bridge, with a molten-metallic glow</p>

<p>that dazzled their eyes, though the sun itself was hidden by the</p>

<p>bridge.  They stood still, whereupon little furred and feathered</p>

<p>heads popped up from the smooth surface of the water; but, finding</p>

<p>that the disturbing presences had paused, and not passed by, they</p>

<p>disappeared again.  Upon this river-brink they lingered till the fog</p>

<p>began to close round them--which was very early in the evening at</p>

<p>this time of the year--settling on the lashes of her eyes, where it</p>

<p>rested like crystals, and on his brows and hair.</p>

<p>They walked later on Sundays, when it was quite dark.  Some of the</p>

<p>dairy-people, who were also out of doors on the first Sunday evening</p>

<p>after their engagement, heard her impulsive speeches, ecstasized to</p>

<p>fragments, though they were too far off to hear the words discoursed;</p>

<p>noted the spasmodic catch in her remarks, broken into syllables by</p>

<p>the leapings of her heart, as she walked leaning on his arm; her</p>

<p>contented pauses, the occasional little laugh upon which her soul</p>

<p>seemed to ride--the laugh of a woman in company with the man she</p>

<p>loves and has won from all other women--unlike anything else in</p>

<p>nature.  They marked the buoyancy of her tread, like the skim of a</p>

<p>bird which has not quite alighted.</p>

<p>Her affection for him was now the breath and life of Tess's being;</p>

<p>it enveloped her as a photosphere, irradiated her into forgetfulness</p>

<p>of her past sorrows, keeping back the gloomy spectres that would</p>

<p>persist in their attempts to touch her--doubt, fear, moodiness, care,</p>

<p>shame. She knew that they were waiting like wolves just outside the</p>

<p>circumscribing light, but she had long spells of power to keep them</p>

<p>in hungry subjection there.</p>

<p>A spiritual forgetfulness co-existed with an intellectual</p>

<p>remembrance.  She walked in brightness, but she knew that in the</p>

<p>background those shapes of darkness were always spread.  They might</p>

<p>be receding, or they might be approaching, one or the other, a little</p>

<p>every day.</p>

<p>One evening Tess and Clare were obliged to sit indoors keeping house,</p>

<p>all the other occupants of the domicile being away.  As they talked</p>

<p>she looked thoughtfully up at him, and met his two appreciative eyes.</p>

<p>"I am not worthy of you--no, I am not!" she burst out, jumping up</p>

<p>from her low stool as though appalled at his homage, and the fulness</p>

<p>of her own joy thereat.</p>

<p>Clare, deeming the whole basis of her excitement to be that which was</p>

<p>only the smaller part of it, said--</p>

<p>"I won't have you speak like it, dear Tess!  Distinction does not</p>

<p>consist in the facile use of a contemptible set of conventions, but</p>

<p>in being numbered among those who are true, and honest, and just, and</p>

<p>pure, and lovely, and of good report--as you are, my Tess."</p>

<p>She struggled with the sob in her throat.  How often had that string</p>

<p>of excellences made her young heart ache in church of late years, and</p>

<p>how strange that he should have cited them now.</p>

<p>"Why didn't you stay and love me when I--was sixteen; living with my</p>

<p>little sisters and brothers, and you danced on the green?  O, why</p>

<p>didn't you, why didn't you!" she said, impetuously clasping her</p>

<p>hands.</p>

<p>Angel began to comfort and reassure her, thinking to himself, truly</p>

<p>enough, what a creature of moods she was, and how careful he would</p>

<p>have to be of her when she depended for her happiness entirely on</p>

<p>him.</p>

<p>"Ah--why didn't I stay!" he said.  "That is just what I feel.  If I</p>

<p>had only known!  But you must not be so bitter in your regret--why</p>

<p>should you be?"</p>

<p>With the woman's instinct to hide she diverged hastily--</p>

<p>"I should have had four years more of your heart than I can ever have</p>

<p>now.  Then I should not have wasted my time as I have done--I should</p>

<p>have had so much longer happiness!"</p>

<p>It was no mature woman with a long dark vista of intrigue behind her</p>

<p>who was tormented thus, but a girl of simple life, not yet one-and</p>

<p>twenty, who had been caught during her days of immaturity like a bird</p>

<p>in a springe.  To calm herself the more completely, she rose from her</p>

<p>little stool and left the room, overturning the stool with her skirts</p>

<p>as she went.</p>

<p>He sat on by the cheerful firelight thrown from a bundle of green</p>

<p>ash-sticks laid across the dogs; the sticks snapped pleasantly, and</p>

<p>hissed out bubbles of sap from their ends.  When she came back she</p>

<p>was herself again.</p>

<p>"Do you not think you are just a wee bit capricious, fitful, Tess?"</p>

<p>he said, good-humouredly, as he spread a cushion for her on the</p>

<p>stool, and seated himself in the settle beside her.  "I wanted to</p>

<p>ask you something, and just then you ran away."</p>

<p>"Yes, perhaps I am capricious," she murmured.  She suddenly</p>

<p>approached him, and put a hand upon each of his arms.  "No, Angel,</p>

<p>I am not really so--by nature, I mean!"  The more particularly to</p>

<p>assure him that she was not, she placed herself close to him in the</p>

<p>settle, and allowed her head to find a resting-place against Clare's</p>

<p>shoulder.  "What did you want to ask me--I am sure I will answer it,"</p>

<p>she continued humbly.</p>

<p>"Well, you love me, and have agreed to marry me, and hence there</p>

<p>follows a thirdly, 'When shall the day be?'"</p>

<p>"I like living like this."</p>

<p>"But I must think of starting in business on my own hook with the</p>

<p>new year, or a little later.  And before I get involved in the</p>

<p>multifarious details of my new position, I should like to have</p>

<p>secured my partner."</p>

<p>"But," she timidly answered, "to talk quite practically, wouldn't it</p>

<p>be best not to marry till after all that?--Though I can't bear the</p>

<p>thought o' your going away and leaving me here!"</p>

<p>"Of course you cannot--and it is not best in this case.  I want you</p>

<p>to help me in many ways in making my start. When shall it be?  Why</p>

<p>not a fortnight from now?"</p>

<p>"No," she said, becoming grave: "I have so many things to think of</p>

<p>first."</p>

<p>"But--"</p>

<p>He drew her gently nearer to him.</p>

<p>The reality of marriage was startling when it loomed so near.  Before</p>

<p>discussion of the question had proceeded further there walked round</p>

<p>the corner of the settle into the full firelight of the apartment Mr</p>

<p>Dairyman Crick, Mrs Crick, and two of the milkmaids.</p>

<p>Tess sprang like an elastic ball from his side to her feet, while her</p>

<p>face flushed and her eyes shone in the firelight.</p>

<p>"I knew how it would be if I sat so close to him!" she cried, with</p>

<p>vexation.  "I said to myself, they are sure to come and catch us!</p>

<p>But I wasn't really sitting on his knee, though it might ha' seemed</p>

<p>as if I was almost!"</p>

<p>"Well--if so be you hadn't told us, I am sure we shouldn't ha'</p>

<p>noticed that ye had been sitting anywhere at all in this light,"</p>

<p>replied the dairyman.  He continued to his wife, with the stolid</p>

<p>mien of a man who understood nothing of the emotions relating to</p>

<p>matrimony--"Now, Christianer, that shows that folks should never</p>

<p>fancy other folks be supposing things when they bain't.  O no, I</p>

<p>should never ha' thought a word of where she was a sitting to, if</p>

<p>she hadn't told me--not I."</p>

<p>"We are going to be married soon," said Clare, with improvised</p>

<p>phlegm.</p>

<p>"Ah--and be ye!  Well, I am truly glad to hear it, sir.  I've</p>

<p>thought you mid do such a thing for some time.  She's too good for a</p>

<p>dairymaid--I said so the very first day I zid her--and a prize for</p>

<p>any man; and what's more, a wonderful woman for a gentleman-farmer's</p>

<p>wife; he won't be at the mercy of his baily wi' her at his side."</p>

<p>Somehow Tess disappeared.  She had been even more struck with the</p>

<p>look of the girls who followed Crick than abashed by Crick's blunt</p>

<p>praise.</p>

<p>After supper, when she reached her bedroom, they were all present.  A</p>

<p>light was burning, and each damsel was sitting up whitely in her bed,</p>

<p>awaiting Tess, the whole like a row of avenging ghosts.</p>

<p>But she saw in a few moments that there was no malice in their mood.</p>

<p>They could scarcely feel as a loss what they had never expected to</p>

<p>have.  Their condition was objective, contemplative.</p>

<p>"He's going to marry her!" murmured Retty, never taking eyes off</p>

<p>Tess.  "How her face do show it!"</p>

<p>"You BE going to marry him?" asked Marian.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Tess.</p>

<p>"When?"</p>

<p>"Some day."</p>

<p>They thought that this was evasiveness only.</p>

<p>"YES--going to MARRY him--a gentleman!" repeated Izz Huett.</p>

<p>And by a sort of fascination the three girls, one after another,</p>

<p>crept out of their beds, and came and stood barefooted round Tess.</p>

<p>Retty put her hands upon Tess's shoulders, as if to realize her</p>

<p>friend's corporeality after such a miracle, and the other two laid</p>

<p>their arms round her waist, all looking into her face.</p>

<p>"How it do seem!  Almost more than I can think of!" said Izz Huett.</p>

<p>Marian kissed Tess.  "Yes," she murmured as she withdrew her lips.</p>

<p>"Was that because of love for her, or because other lips have touched</p>

<p>there by now?" continued Izz drily to Marian.</p>

<p>"I wasn't thinking o' that," said Marian simply.  "I was on'y feeling</p>

<p>all the strangeness o't--that she is to be his wife, and nobody else.</p>

<p>I don't say nay to it, nor either of us, because we did not think</p>

<p>of it--only loved him.  Still, nobody else is to marry'n in the</p>

<p>world--no fine lady, nobody in silks and satins; but she who do live</p>

<p>like we."</p>

<p>"Are you sure you don't dislike me for it?" said Tess in a low voice.</p>

<p>They hung about her in their white nightgowns before replying, as if</p>

<p>they considered their answer might lie in her look.</p>

<p>"I don't know--I don't know," murmured Retty Priddle.  "I want to</p>

<p>hate 'ee; but I cannot!"</p>

<p>"That's how I feel," echoed Izz and Marian.  "I can't hate her.</p>

<p>Somehow she hinders me!"</p>

<p>"He ought to marry one of you," murmured Tess.</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"You are all better than I."</p>

<p>"We better than you?" said the girls in a low, slow whisper.  "No,</p>

<p>no, dear Tess!"</p>

<p>"You are!" she contradicted impetuously.  And suddenly tearing away</p>

<p>from their clinging arms she burst into a hysterical fit of tears,</p>

<p>bowing herself on the chest of drawers and repeating incessantly,</p>

<p>"O yes, yes, yes!"</p>

<p>Having once given way she could not stop her weeping.</p>

<p>"He ought to have had one of you!" she cried.  "I think I ought to</p>

<p>make him even now!  You would be better for him than--I don't know</p>

<p>what I'm saying!  O!  O!"</p>

<p>They went up to her and clasped her round, but still her sobs tore</p>

<p>her.</p>

<p>"Get some water," said Marian,  "She's upset by us, poor thing, poor</p>

<p>thing!"</p>

<p>They gently led her back to the side of her bed, where they kissed</p>

<p>her warmly.</p>

<p>"You are best for'n," said Marian.  "More ladylike, and a better</p>

<p>scholar than we, especially since he had taught 'ee so much.  But</p>

<p>even you ought to be proud.  You BE proud, I'm sure!"</p>

<p>"Yes, I am," she said; "and I am ashamed at so breaking down."</p>

<p>When they were all in bed, and the light was out, Marian whispered</p>

<p>across to her--</p>

<p>"You will think of us when you be his wife, Tess, and of how we told</p>

<p>'ee that we loved him, and how we tried not to hate you, and did not</p>

<p>hate you, and could not hate you, because you were his choice, and</p>

<p>we never hoped to be chose by him."</p>

<p>They were not aware that, at these words, salt, stinging tears</p>

<p>trickled down upon Tess's pillow anew, and how she resolved, with a</p>

<p>bursting heart, to tell all her history to Angel Clare, despite her</p>

<p>mother's command--to let him for whom she lived and breathed despise</p>

<p>her if he would, and her mother regard her as a fool, rather then</p>

<p>preserve a silence which might be deemed a treachery to him, and</p>

<p>which somehow seemed a wrong to these.</p>

<p>XXXII</p>

<p>This penitential mood kept her from naming the wedding-day. The</p>

<p>beginning of November found its date still in abeyance, though he</p>

<p>asked her at the most tempting times.  But Tess's desire seemed to be</p>

<p>for a perpetual betrothal in which everything should remain as it was</p>

<p>then.</p>

<p>The meads were changing now; but it was still warm enough in early</p>

<p>afternoons before milking to idle there awhile, and the state of</p>

<p>dairy-work at this time of year allowed a spare hour for idling.</p>

<p>Looking over the damp sod in the direction of the sun, a glistening</p>

<p>ripple of gossamer webs was visible to their eyes under the luminary,</p>

<p>like the track of moonlight on the sea.  Gnats, knowing nothing</p>

<p>of their brief glorification, wandered across the shimmer of this</p>

<p>pathway, irradiated as if they bore fire within them, then passed out</p>

<p>of its line, and were quite extinct.  In the presence of these things</p>

<p>he would remind her that the date was still the question.</p>

<p>Or he would ask her at night, when he accompanied her on some mission</p>

<p>invented by Mrs Crick to give him the opportunity.  This was mostly a</p>

<p>journey to the farmhouse on the slopes above the vale, to inquire how</p>

<p>the advanced cows were getting on in the straw-barton to which they</p>

<p>were relegated.  For it was a time of the year that brought great</p>

<p>changes to the world of kine.  Batches of the animals were sent away</p>

<p>daily to this lying-in hospital, where they lived on straw till their</p>

<p>calves were born, after which event, and as soon as the calf could</p>

<p>walk, mother and offspring were driven back to the dairy.  In the</p>

<p>interval which elapsed before the calves were sold there was, of</p>

<p>course, little milking to be done, but as soon as the calf had been</p>

<p>taken away the milkmaids would have to set to work as usual.</p>

<p>Returning from one of these dark walks they reached a great</p>

<p>gravel-cliff immediately over the levels, where they stood still and</p>

<p>listened.  The water was now high in the streams, squirting through</p>

<p>the weirs, and tinkling under culverts; the smallest gullies were all</p>

<p>full; there was no taking short cuts anywhere, and foot-passengers</p>

<p>were compelled to follow the permanent ways.  From the whole extent</p>

<p>of the invisible vale came a multitudinous intonation; it forced upon</p>

<p>their fancy that a great city lay below them, and that the murmur was</p>

<p>the vociferation of its populace.</p>

<p>"It seems like tens of thousands of them," said Tess; "holding</p>

<p>public-meetings in their market-places, arguing, preaching,</p>

<p>quarrelling, sobbing, groaning, praying, and cursing."</p>

<p>Clare was not particularly heeding.</p>

<p>"Did Crick speak to you to-day, dear, about his not wanting much</p>

<p>assistance during the winter months?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"The cows are going dry rapidly."</p>

<p>"Yes.  Six or seven went to the straw-barton yesterday, and three the</p>

<p>day before, making nearly twenty in the straw already.  Ah--is it</p>

<p>that the farmer don't want my help for the calving?  O, I am not</p>

<p>wanted here any more!  And I have tried so hard to--"</p>

<p>"Crick didn't exactly say that he would no longer require you.  But,</p>

<p>knowing what our relations were, he said in the most good-natured</p>

<p>and respectful manner possible that he supposed on my leaving at</p>

<p>Christmas I should take you with me, and on my asking what he would</p>

<p>do without you he merely observed that, as a matter of fact, it was a</p>

<p>time of year when he could do with a very little female help.  I am</p>

<p>afraid I was sinner enough to feel rather glad that he was in this</p>

<p>way forcing your hand."</p>

<p>"I don't think you ought to have felt glad, Angel.  Because 'tis</p>

<p>always mournful not to be wanted, even if at the same time 'tis</p>

<p>convenient."</p>

<p>"Well, it is convenient--you have admitted that."  He put his finger</p>

<p>upon her cheek.  "Ah!" he said.</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"I feel the red rising up at her having been caught!  But why should</p>

<p>I trifle so!  We will not trifle--life is too serious."</p>

<p>"It is.  Perhaps I saw that before you did."</p>

<p>She was seeing it then.  To decline to marry him after all--in</p>

<p>obedience to her emotion of last night--and leave the dairy, meant</p>

<p>to go to some strange place, not a dairy; for milkmaids were not in</p>

<p>request now calving-time was coming on; to go to some arable farm</p>

<p>where no divine being like Angel Clare was.  She hated the thought,</p>

<p>and she hated more the thought of going home.</p>

<p>"So that, seriously, dearest Tess," he continued, "since you will</p>

<p>probably have to leave at Christmas, it is in every way desirable and</p>

<p>convenient that I should carry you off then as my property.  Besides,</p>

<p>if you were not the most uncalculating girl in the world you would</p>

<p>know that we could not go on like this for ever."</p>

<p>"I wish we could.  That it would always be summer and autumn, and you</p>

<p>always courting me, and always thinking as much of me as you have</p>

<p>done through the past summer-time!"</p>

<p>"I always shall."</p>

<p>"O, I know you will!" she cried, with a sudden fervour of faith</p>

<p>in him.  "Angel, I will fix the day when I will become yours for</p>

<p>always!"</p>

<p>Thus at last it was arranged between them, during that dark walk</p>

<p>home, amid the myriads of liquid voices on the right and left.</p>

<p>When they reached the dairy Mr and Mrs Crick were promptly told--with</p>

<p>injunctions of secrecy; for each of the lovers was desirous that the</p>

<p>marriage should be kept as private as possible.  The dairyman, though</p>

<p>he had thought of dismissing her soon, now made a great concern about</p>

<p>losing her.  What should he do about his skimming?  Who would make</p>

<p>the ornamental butter-pats for the Anglebury and Sandbourne ladies?</p>

<p>Mrs Crick congratulated Tess on the shilly-shallying having at last</p>

<p>come to an end, and said that directly she set eyes on Tess she</p>

<p>divined that she was to be the chosen one of somebody who was no</p>

<p>common outdoor man; Tess had looked so superior as she walked across</p>

<p>the barton on that afternoon of her arrival; that she was of a good</p>

<p>family she could have sworn.  In point of fact Mrs Crick did remember</p>

<p>thinking that Tess was graceful and good-looking as she approached;</p>

<p>but the superiority might have been a growth of the imagination aided</p>

<p>by subsequent knowledge.</p>

<p>Tess was now carried along upon the wings of the hours, without the</p>

<p>sense of a will.  The word had been given; the number of the day</p>

<p>written down.  Her naturally bright intelligence had begun to admit</p>

<p>the fatalistic convictions common to field-folk and those who</p>

<p>associate more extensively with natural phenomena than with their</p>

<p>fellow-creatures; and she accordingly drifted into that passive</p>

<p>responsiveness to all things her lover suggested, characteristic of</p>

<p>the frame of mind.</p>

<p>But she wrote anew to her mother, ostensibly to notify the</p>

<p>wedding-day; really to again implore her advice.  It was a gentleman</p>

<p>who had chosen her, which perhaps her mother had not sufficiently</p>

<p>considered.  A post-nuptial explanation, which might be accepted with</p>

<p>a light heart by a rougher man, might not be received with the same</p>

<p>feeling by him.  But this communication brought no reply from Mrs</p>

<p>Durbeyfield.</p>

<p>Despite Angel Clare's plausible representation to himself and to Tess</p>

<p>of the practical need for their immediate marriage, there was in</p>

<p>truth an element of precipitancy in the step, as became apparent at a</p>

<p>later date.  He loved her dearly, though perhaps rather ideally and</p>

<p>fancifully than with the impassioned thoroughness of her feeling for</p>

<p>him.  He had entertained no notion, when doomed as he had thought to</p>

<p>an unintellectual bucolic life, that such charms as he beheld in this</p>

<p>idyllic creature would be found behind the scenes.  Unsophistication</p>

<p>was a thing to talk of; but he had not known how it really struck one</p>

<p>until he came here.  Yet he was very far from seeing his future track</p>

<p>clearly, and it might be a year or two before he would be able to</p>

<p>consider himself fairly started in life.  The secret lay in the tinge</p>

<p>of recklessness imparted to his career and character by the sense</p>

<p>that he had been made to miss his true destiny through the prejudices</p>

<p>of his family.</p>

<p>"Don't you think 'twould have been better for us to wait till you</p>

<p>were quite settled in your midland farm?" she once asked timidly.</p>

<p>(A midland farm was the idea just then.)</p>

<p>"To tell the truth, my Tess, I don't like you to be left anywhere</p>

<p>away from my protection and sympathy."</p>

<p>The reason was a good one, so far as it went.  His influence over her</p>

<p>had been so marked that she had caught his manner and habits, his</p>

<p>speech and phrases, his likings and his aversions.  And to leave her</p>

<p>in farmland would be to let her slip back again out of accord with</p>

<p>him.  He wished to have her under his charge for another reason.</p>

<p>His parents had naturally desired to see her once at least before he</p>

<p>carried her off to a distant settlement, English or colonial; and</p>

<p>as no opinion of theirs was to be allowed to change his intention,</p>

<p>he judged that a couple of months' life with him in lodgings</p>

<p>whilst seeking for an advantageous opening would be of some social</p>

<p>assistance to her at what she might feel to be a trying ordeal--her</p>

<p>presentation to his mother at the Vicarage.</p>

<p>Next, he wished to see a little of the working of a flour-mill,</p>

<p>having an idea that he might combine the use of one with</p>

<p>corn-growing.  The proprietor of a large old water-mill at</p>

<p>Wellbridge--once the mill of an Abbey--had offered him the inspection</p>

<p>of his time-honoured mode of procedure, and a hand in the operations</p>

<p>for a few days, whenever he should choose to come.  Clare paid a</p>

<p>visit to the place, some few miles distant, one day at this time,</p>

<p>to inquire particulars, and returned to Talbothays in the evening.</p>

<p>She found him determined to spend a short time at the Wellbridge</p>

<p>flour-mills. And what had determined him?  Less the opportunity of an</p>

<p>insight into grinding and bolting than the casual fact that lodgings</p>

<p>were to be obtained in that very farmhouse which, before its</p>

<p>mutilation, had been the mansion of a branch of the d'Urberville</p>

<p>family.  This was always how Clare settled practical questions; by</p>

<p>a sentiment which had nothing to do with them.  They decided to go</p>

<p>immediately after the wedding, and remain for a fortnight, instead</p>

<p>of journeying to towns and inns.</p>

<p>"Then we will start off to examine some farms on the other side of</p>

<p>London that I have heard of," he said, "and by March or April we will</p>

<p>pay a visit to my father and mother."</p>

<p>Questions of procedure such as these arose and passed, and the day,</p>

<p>the incredible day, on which she was to become his, loomed large in</p>

<p>the near future.  The thirty-first of December, New Year's Eve, was</p>

<p>the date.  His wife, she said to herself.  Could it ever be?  Their</p>

<p>two selves together, nothing to divide them, every incident shared</p>

<p>by them; why not?  And yet why?</p>

<p>One Sunday morning Izz Huett returned from church, and spoke</p>

<p>privately to Tess.</p>

<p>"You was not called home this morning."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"It should ha' been the first time of asking to-day," she answered,</p>

<p>looking quietly at Tess.  "You meant to be married New Year's Eve,</p>

<p>deary?"</p>

<p>The other returned a quick affirmative.</p>

<p>"And there must be three times of asking.  And now there be only two</p>

<p>Sundays left between."</p>

<p>Tess felt her cheek paling; Izz was right; of course there must be</p>

<p>three.  Perhaps he had forgotten!  If so, there must be a week's</p>

<p>postponement, and that was unlucky.  How could she remind her lover?</p>

<p>She who had been so backward was suddenly fired with impatience and</p>

<p>alarm lest she should lose her dear prize.</p>

<p>A natural incident relieved her anxiety.  Izz mentioned the omission</p>

<p>of the banns to Mrs Crick, and Mrs Crick assumed a matron's privilege</p>

<p>of speaking to Angel on the point.</p>

<p>"Have ye forgot 'em, Mr Clare?  The banns, I mean."</p>

<p>"No, I have not forgot 'em," says Clare.</p>

<p>As soon as he caught Tess alone he assured her:</p>

<p>"Don't let them tease you about the banns.  A licence will be quieter</p>

<p>for us, and I have decided on a licence without consulting you.</p>

<p>So if you go to church on Sunday morning you will not hear your own</p>

<p>name, if you wished to."</p>

<p>"I didn't wish to hear it, dearest," she said proudly.</p>

<p>But to know that things were in train was an immense relief to Tess</p>

<p>notwithstanding, who had well-nigh feared that somebody would stand</p>

<p>up and forbid the banns on the ground of her history.  How events</p>

<p>were favouring her!</p>

<p>"I don't quite feel easy," she said to herself.  "All this good</p>

<p>fortune may be scourged out of me afterwards by a lot of ill.  That's</p>

<p>how Heaven mostly does.  I wish I could have had common banns!"</p>

<p>But everything went smoothly.  She wondered whether he would like her</p>

<p>to be married in her present best white frock, or if she ought to</p>

<p>buy a new one.  The question was set at rest by his forethought,</p>

<p>disclosed by the arrival of some large packages addressed to her.</p>

<p>Inside them she found a whole stock of clothing, from bonnet to</p>

<p>shoes, including a perfect morning costume, such as would well suit</p>

<p>the simple wedding they planned.  He entered the house shortly after</p>

<p>the arrival of the packages, and heard her upstairs undoing them.</p>

<p>A minute later she came down with a flush on her face and tears in</p>

<p>her eyes.</p>

<p>"How thoughtful you've been!" she murmured, her cheek upon his</p>

<p>shoulder.  "Even to the gloves and handkerchief!  My own love--how</p>

<p>good, how kind!"</p>

<p>"No, no, Tess; just an order to a tradeswoman in London--nothing</p>

<p>more."</p>

<p>And to divert her from thinking too highly of him, he told her to go</p>

<p>upstairs, and take her time, and see if it all fitted; and, if not,</p>

<p>to get the village sempstress to make a few alterations.</p>

<p>She did return upstairs, and put on the gown.  Alone, she stood for a</p>

<p>moment before the glass looking at the effect of her silk attire; and</p>

<p>then there came into her head her mother's ballad of the mystic</p>

<p>robe--</p>

<p>     That never would become that wife</p>

<p>       That had once done amiss,</p>

<p>which Mrs Durbeyfield had used to sing to her as a child, so blithely</p>

<p>and so archly, her foot on the cradle, which she rocked to the tune.</p>

<p>Suppose this robe should betray her by changing colour, as her robe</p>

<p>had betrayed Queen Guinevere.  Since she had been at the dairy she</p>

<p>had not once thought of the lines till now.</p>

<p>XXXIII</p>

<p>Angel felt that he would like to spend a day with her before the</p>

<p>wedding, somewhere away from the dairy, as a last jaunt in her</p>

<p>company while there were yet mere lover and mistress; a romantic day,</p>

<p>in circumstances that would never be repeated; with that other and</p>

<p>greater day beaming close ahead of them.  During the preceding week,</p>

<p>therefore, he suggested making a few purchases in the nearest town,</p>

<p>and they started together.</p>

<p>Clare's life at the dairy had been that of a recluse in respect the</p>

<p>world of his own class.  For months he had never gone near a town,</p>

<p>and, requiring no vehicle, had never kept one, hiring the dairyman's</p>

<p>cob or gig if he rode or drove.  They went in the gig that day.</p>

<p>And then for the first time in their lives they shopped as partners</p>

<p>in one concern.  It was Christmas Eve, with its loads a holly and</p>

<p>mistletoe, and the town was very full of strangers who had come in</p>

<p>from all parts of the country on account of the day.  Tess paid the</p>

<p>penalty of walking about with happiness superadded to beauty on her</p>

<p>countenance by being much stared at as she moved amid them on his</p>

<p>arm.</p>

<p>In the evening they returned to the inn at which they had put up, and</p>

<p>Tess waited in the entry while Angel went to see the horse and gig</p>

<p>brought to the door.  The general sitting-room was full of guests,</p>

<p>who were continually going in and out.  As the door opened and shut</p>

<p>each time for the passage of these, the light within the parlour fell</p>

<p>full upon Tess's face.  Two men came out and passed by her among the</p>

<p>rest.  One of them had stared her up and down in surprise, and she</p>

<p>fancied he was a Trantridge man, though that village lay so many</p>

<p>miles off that Trantridge folk were rarities here.</p>

<p>"A comely maid that," said the other.</p>

<p>"True, comely enough.  But unless I make a great mistake--"  And he</p>

<p>negatived the remainder of the definition forthwith.</p>

<p>Clare had just returned from the stable-yard, and, confronting the</p>

<p>man on the threshold, heard the words, and saw the shrinking of</p>

<p>Tess.  The insult to her stung him to the quick, and before he had</p>

<p>considered anything at all he struck the man on the chin with the</p>

<p>full force of his fist, sending him staggering backwards into the</p>

<p>passage.</p>

<p>The man recovered himself, and seemed inclined to come on, and Clare,</p>

<p>stepping outside the door, put himself in a posture of defence.  But</p>

<p>his opponent began to think better of the matter.  He looked anew at</p>

<p>Tess as he passed her, and said to Clare--</p>

<p>"I beg pardon, sir; 'twas a complete mistake.  I thought she was</p>

<p>another woman, forty miles from here."</p>

<p>Clare, feeling then that he had been too hasty, and that he was,</p>

<p>moreover, to blame for leaving her standing in an inn-passage, did</p>

<p>what he usually did in such cases, gave the man five shillings to</p>

<p>plaster the blow; and thus they parted, bidding each other a pacific</p>

<p>good night.  As soon as Clare had taken the reins from the ostler,</p>

<p>and the young couple had driven off, the two men went in the other</p>

<p>direction.</p>

<p>"And was it a mistake?" said the second one.</p>

<p>"Not a bit of it.  But I didn't want to hurt the gentleman's</p>

<p>feelings--not I."</p>

<p>In the meantime the lovers were driving onward.</p>

<p>"Could we put off our wedding till a little later?" Tess asked in a</p>

<p>dry dull voice.  "I mean if we wished?"</p>

<p>"No, my love.  Calm yourself.  Do you mean that the fellow may have</p>

<p>time to summon me for assault?" he asked good-humouredly.</p>

<p>"No--I only meant--if it should have to be put off."</p>

<p>What she meant was not very clear, and he directed her to dismiss</p>

<p>such fancies from her mind, which she obediently did as well as she</p>

<p>could.  But she was grave, very grave, all the way home; till she</p>

<p>thought, "We shall go away, a very long distance, hundreds of miles</p>

<p>from these parts, and such as this can never happen again, and no</p>

<p>ghost of the past reach there."</p>

<p>They parted tenderly that night on the landing, and Clare ascended to</p>

<p>his attic.  Tess sat up getting on with some little requisites, lest</p>

<p>the few remaining days should not afford sufficient time.  While she</p>

<p>sat she heard a noise in Angel's room overhead, a sound of thumping</p>

<p>and struggling.  Everybody else in the house was asleep, and in her</p>

<p>anxiety lest Clare should be ill she ran up and knocked at his door,</p>

<p>and asked him what was the matter.</p>

<p>"Oh, nothing, dear," he said from within.  "I am so sorry I disturbed</p>

<p>you!  But the reason is rather an amusing one: I fell asleep and</p>

<p>dreamt that I was fighting that fellow again who insulted you,</p>

<p>and the noise you heard was my pummelling away with my fists at</p>

<p>my portmanteau, which I pulled out to-day for packing.  I am</p>

<p>occasionally liable to these freaks in my sleep. Go to bed and</p>

<p>think of it no more."</p>

<p>This was the last drachm required to turn the scale of her</p>

<p>indecision.  Declare the past to him by word of mouth she could not;</p>

<p>but there was another way.  She sat down and wrote on the four pages</p>

<p>of a note-sheet a succinct narrative of those events of three or four</p>

<p>years ago, put it into an envelope, and directed it to Clare.  Then,</p>

<p>lest the flesh should again be weak, she crept upstairs without any</p>

<p>shoes and slipped the note under his door.</p>

<p>Her night was a broken one, as it well might be, and she listened for</p>

<p>the first faint noise overhead.  It came, as usual; he descended, as</p>

<p>usual.  She descended.  He met her at the bottom of the stairs and</p>

<p>kissed her. Surely it was as warmly as ever!</p>

<p>He looked a little disturbed and worn, she thought.  But he said not</p>

<p>a word to her about her revelation, even when they were alone.  Could</p>

<p>he have had it?  Unless he began the subject she felt that she could</p>

<p>say nothing.  So the day passed, and it was evident that whatever</p>

<p>he thought he meant to keep to himself.  Yet he was frank and</p>

<p>affectionate as before.  Could it be that her doubts were childish?</p>

<p>that he forgave her; that he loved her for what she was, just as she</p>

<p>was, and smiled at her disquiet as at a foolish nightmare?  Had he</p>

<p>really received her note?  She glanced into his room, and could see</p>

<p>nothing of it.  It might be that he forgave her.  But even if he had</p>

<p>not received it she had a sudden enthusiastic trust that he surely</p>

<p>would forgive her.</p>

<p>Every morning and night he was the same, and thus New Year's Eve</p>

<p>broke--the wedding day.</p>

<p>The lovers did not rise at milking-time, having through the whole of</p>

<p>this last week of their sojourn at the dairy been accorded something</p>

<p>of the position of guests, Tess being honoured with a room of her</p>

<p>own.  When they arrived downstairs at breakfast-time they were</p>

<p>surprised to see what effects had been produced in the large</p>

<p>kitchen for their glory since they had last beheld it.  At some</p>

<p>unnatural hour of the morning the dairyman had caused the yawning</p>

<p>chimney-corner to be whitened, and the brick hearth reddened, and a</p>

<p>blazing yellow damask blower to be hung across the arch in place of</p>

<p>the old grimy blue cotton one with a black sprig pattern which had</p>

<p>formerly done duty there.  This renovated aspect of what was the</p>

<p>focus indeed of the room on a full winter morning threw a smiling</p>

<p>demeanour over the whole apartment.</p>

<p>"I was determined to do summat in honour o't", said the dairyman.</p>

<p>"And as you wouldn't hear of my gieing a rattling good randy wi'</p>

<p>fiddles and bass-viols complete, as we should ha' done in old times,</p>

<p>this was all I could think o' as a noiseless thing."</p>

<p>Tess's friends lived so far off that none could conveniently have</p>

<p>been present at the ceremony, even had any been asked; but as a fact</p>

<p>nobody was invited from Marlott.  As for Angel's family, he had</p>

<p>written and duly informed them of the time, and assured them that he</p>

<p>would be glad to see one at least of them there for the day if he</p>

<p>would like to come.  His brothers had not replied at all, seeming</p>

<p>to be indignant with him; while his father and mother had written</p>

<p>a rather sad letter, deploring his precipitancy in rushing into</p>

<p>marriage, but making the best of the matter by saying that, though</p>

<p>a dairywoman was the last daughter-in-law they could have expected,</p>

<p>their son had arrived at an age which he might be supposed to be the</p>

<p>best judge.</p>

<p>This coolness in his relations distressed Clare less than it would</p>

<p>have done had he been without the grand card with which he meant to</p>

<p>surprise them ere long.  To produce Tess, fresh from the dairy, as</p>

<p>a d'Urberville and a lady, he had felt to be temerarious and risky;</p>

<p>hence he had concealed her lineage till such time as, familiarized</p>

<p>with worldly ways by a few months' travel and reading with him, he</p>

<p>could take her on a visit to his parents and impart the knowledge</p>

<p>while triumphantly producing her as worthy of such an ancient line.</p>

<p>It was a pretty lover's dream, if no more.  Perhaps Tess's lineage</p>

<p>had more value for himself than for anybody in the world beside.</p>

<p>Her perception that Angel's bearing towards her still remained in no</p>

<p>whit altered by her own communication rendered Tess guiltily doubtful</p>

<p>if he could have received it.  She rose from breakfast before he had</p>

<p>finished, and hastened upstairs.  It had occurred to her to look once</p>

<p>more into the queer gaunt room which had been Clare's den, or rather</p>

<p>eyrie, for so long, and climbing the ladder she stood at the open</p>

<p>door of the apartment, regarding and pondering.  She stooped to the</p>

<p>threshold of the doorway, where she had pushed in the note two or</p>

<p>three days earlier in such excitement.  The carpet reached close to</p>

<p>the sill, and under the edge of the carpet she discerned the faint</p>

<p>white margin of the envelope containing her letter to him, which he</p>

<p>obviously had never seen, owing to her having in her haste thrust it</p>

<p>beneath the carpet as well as beneath the door.</p>

<p>With a feeling of faintness she withdrew the letter. There it</p>

<p>was--sealed up, just as it had left her hands.  The mountain had</p>

<p>not yet been removed.  She could not let him read it now, the house</p>

<p>being in full bustle of preparation; and descending to her own room</p>

<p>she destroyed the letter there.</p>

<p>She was so pale when he saw her again that he felt quite anxious.</p>

<p>The incident of the misplaced letter she had jumped at as if it</p>

<p>prevented a confession; but she knew in her conscience that it need</p>

<p>not; there was still time.  Yet everything was in a stir; there</p>

<p>was coming and going; all had to dress, the dairyman and Mrs Crick</p>

<p>having been asked to accompany them as witnesses; and reflection or</p>

<p>deliberate talk was well-nigh impossible.  The only minute Tess could</p>

<p>get to be alone with Clare was when they met upon the landing.</p>

<p>"I am so anxious to talk to you--I want to confess all my faults and</p>

<p>blunders!" she said with attempted lightness.</p>

<p>"No, no--we can't have faults talked of--you must be deemed perfect</p>

<p>to-day at least, my Sweet!" he cried.  "We shall have plenty of time,</p>

<p>hereafter, I hope, to talk over our failings.  I will confess mine at</p>

<p>the same time."</p>

<p>"But it would be better for me to do it now, I think, so that you</p>

<p>could not say--"</p>

<p>"Well, my quixotic one, you shall tell me anything--say, as soon as</p>

<p>we are settled in our lodging; not now.  I, too, will tell you my</p>

<p>faults then.  But do not let us spoil the day with them; they will</p>

<p>be excellent matter for a dull time."</p>

<p>"Then you don't wish me to, dearest?"</p>

<p>"I do not, Tessy, really."</p>

<p>The hurry of dressing and starting left no time for more than this.</p>

<p>Those words of his seemed to reassure her on further reflection.</p>

<p>She was whirled onward through the next couple of critical hours by</p>

<p>the mastering tide of her devotion to him, which closed up further</p>

<p>meditation.  Her one desire, so long resisted, to make herself his,</p>

<p>to call him her lord, her own--then, if necessary, to die--had</p>

<p>at last lifted her up from her plodding reflective pathway.  In</p>

<p>dressing, she moved about in a mental cloud of many-coloured</p>

<p>idealities, which eclipsed all sinister contingencies by its</p>

<p>brightness.</p>

<p>The church was a long way off, and they were obliged to drive,</p>

<p>particularly as it was winter.  A closed carriage was ordered from</p>

<p>a roadside inn, a vehicle which had been kept there ever since the</p>

<p>old days of post-chaise travelling.  It had stout wheel-spokes, and</p>

<p>heavy felloes a great curved bed, immense straps and springs, and a</p>

<p>pole like a battering-ram.  The postilion was a venerable "boy" of</p>

<p>sixty--a martyr to rheumatic gout, the result of excessive exposure</p>

<p>in youth, counter-acted by strong liquors--who had stood at inn-doors</p>

<p>doing nothing for the whole five-and-twenty years that had elapsed</p>

<p>since he had no longer been required to ride professionally, as if</p>

<p>expecting the old times to come back again.  He had a permanent</p>

<p>running wound on the outside of his right leg, originated by the</p>

<p>constant bruisings of aristocratic carriage-poles during the many</p>

<p>years that he had been in regular employ at the King's Arms,</p>

<p>Casterbridge.</p>

<p>Inside this cumbrous and creaking structure, and behind this decayed</p>

<p>conductor, the _partie carrйe_ took their seats--the bride and</p>

<p>bridegroom and Mr and Mrs Crick.  Angel would have liked one at least</p>

<p>of his brothers to be present as groomsman, but their silence after</p>

<p>his gentle hint to that effect by letter had signified that they did</p>

<p>not care to come.  They disapproved of the marriage, and could not be</p>

<p>expected to countenance it.  Perhaps it was as well that they could</p>

<p>not be present. They were not worldly young fellows, but fraternizing</p>

<p>with dairy-folk would have struck unpleasantly upon their biased</p>

<p>niceness, apart from their views of the match.</p>

<p>Upheld by the momentum of the time, Tess knew nothing of this, did</p>

<p>not see anything, did not know the road they were taking to the</p>

<p>church.  She knew that Angel was close to her; all the rest was</p>

<p>a luminous mist.  She was a sort of celestial person, who owed</p>

<p>her being to poetry--one of those classical divinities Clare was</p>

<p>accustomed to talk to her about when they took their walks together.</p>

<p>The marriage being by licence there were only a dozen or so of people</p>

<p>in the church; had there been a thousand they would have produced</p>

<p>no more effect upon her.  They were at stellar distances from her</p>

<p>present world.  In the ecstatic solemnity with which she swore her</p>

<p>faith to him the ordinary sensibilities of sex seemed a flippancy.</p>

<p>At a pause in the service, while they were kneeling together, she</p>

<p>unconsciously inclined herself towards him, so that her shoulder</p>

<p>touched his arm; she had been frightened by a passing thought, and</p>

<p>the movement had been automatic, to assure herself that he was really</p>

<p>there, and to fortify her belief that his fidelity would be proof</p>

<p>against all things.</p>

<p>Clare knew that she loved him--every curve of her form showed that--</p>

<p>but he did not know at that time the full depth of her devotion, its</p>

<p>single-mindedness, its meekness; what long-suffering it guaranteed,</p>

<p>what honesty, what endurance, what good faith.</p>

<p>As they came out of church the ringers swung the bells off their</p>

<p>rests, and a modest peal of three notes broke forth--that limited</p>

<p>amount of expression having been deemed sufficient by the church</p>

<p>builders for the joys of such a small parish.  Passing by the tower</p>

<p>with her husband on the path to the gate she could feel the vibrant</p>

<p>air humming round them from the louvred belfry in the circle of</p>

<p>sound, and it matched the highly-charged mental atmosphere in which</p>

<p>she was living.</p>

<p>This condition of mind, wherein she felt glorified by an irradiation</p>

<p>not her own, like the angel whom St John saw in the sun, lasted till</p>

<p>the sound of the church bells had died away, and the emotions of the</p>

<p>wedding-service had calmed down.  Her eyes could dwell upon details</p>

<p>more clearly now, and Mr and Mrs Crick having directed their own gig</p>

<p>to be sent for them, to leave the carriage to the young couple, she</p>

<p>observed the build and character of that conveyance for the first</p>

<p>time.  Sitting in silence she regarded it long.</p>

<p>"I fancy you seem oppressed, Tessy," said Clare.</p>

<p>"Yes," she answered, putting her hand to her brow.  "I tremble at</p>

<p>many things.  It is all so serious, Angel.  Among other things I seem</p>

<p>to have seen this carriage before, to be very well acquainted with</p>

<p>it.  It is very odd--I must have seen it in a dream."</p>

<p>"Oh--you have heard the legend of the d'Urberville Coach--that</p>

<p>well-known superstition of this county about your family when they</p>

<p>were very popular here; and this lumbering old thing reminds you of</p>

<p>it."</p>

<p>"I have never heard of it to my knowledge," said she.  "What is the</p>

<p>legend--may I know it?"</p>

<p>"Well--I would rather not tell it in detail just now.  A certain</p>

<p>d'Urberville of the sixteenth or seventeenth century committed a</p>

<p>dreadful crime in his family coach; and since that time members of</p>

<p>the family see or hear the old coach whenever--But I'll tell you</p>

<p>another day--it is rather gloomy.  Evidently some dim knowledge of</p>

<p>it has been brought back to your mind by the sight of this venerable</p>

<p>caravan."</p>

<p>"I don't remember hearing it before," she murmured.  "Is it when we</p>

<p>are going to die, Angel, that members of my family see it, or is it</p>

<p>when we have committed a crime?"</p>

<p>"Now, Tess!"</p>

<p>He silenced her by a kiss.</p>

<p>By the time they reached home she was contrite and spiritless.  She</p>

<p>was Mrs Angel Clare, indeed, but had she any moral right to the name?</p>

<p>Was she not more truly Mrs Alexander d'Urberville?  Could intensity</p>

<p>of love justify what might be considered in upright souls as culpable</p>

<p>reticence?  She knew not what was expected of women in such cases;</p>

<p>and she had no counsellor.</p>

<p>However, when she found herself alone in her room for a few</p>

<p>minutes--the last day this on which she was ever to enter it--she</p>

<p>knelt down and prayed.  She tried to pray to God, but it was her</p>

<p>husband who really had her supplication.  Her idolatry of this man</p>

<p>was such that she herself almost feared it to be ill-omened.  She was</p>

<p>conscious of the notion expressed by Friar Laurence: "These violent</p>

<p>delights have violent ends."  It might be too desperate for human</p>

<p>conditions--too rank, to wild, too deadly.</p>

<p>"O my love, why do I love you so!" she whispered there alone; "for</p>

<p>she you love is not my real self, but one in my image; the one I</p>

<p>might have been!"</p>

<p>Afternoon came, and with it the hour for departure. They had decided</p>

<p>to fulfil the plan of going for a few days to the lodgings in the old</p>

<p>farmhouse near Wellbridge Mill, at which he meant to reside during</p>

<p>his investigation of flour processes.  At two o'clock there was</p>

<p>nothing left to do but to start.  All the servantry of the dairy were</p>

<p>standing in the red-brick entry to see them go out, the dairyman and</p>

<p>his wife following to the door.  Tess saw her three chamber-mates</p>

<p>in a row against the wall, pensively inclining their heads.  She</p>

<p>had much questioned if they would appear at the parting moment; but</p>

<p>there they were, stoical and staunch to the last.  She knew why the</p>

<p>delicate Retty looked so fragile, and Izz so tragically sorrowful,</p>

<p>and Marian so blank; and she forgot her own dogging shadow for a</p>

<p>moment in contemplating theirs.</p>

<p>She impulsively whispered to him--</p>

<p>"Will you kiss 'em all, once, poor things, for the first and last</p>

<p>time?"</p>

<p>Clare had not the least objection to such a farewell formality--which</p>

<p>was all that it was to him--and as he passed them he kissed them in</p>

<p>succession where they stood, saying "Goodbye" to each as he did so.</p>

<p>When they reached the door Tess femininely glanced back to discern</p>

<p>the effect of that kiss of charity; there was no triumph in her</p>

<p>glance, as there might have been.  If there had it would have</p>

<p>disappeared when she saw how moved the girls all were.  The kiss had</p>

<p>obviously done harm by awakening feelings they were trying to subdue.</p>

<p>Of all this Clare was unconscious.  Passing on to the wicket-gate he</p>

<p>shook hands with the dairyman and his wife, and expressed his last</p>

<p>thanks to them for their attentions; after which there was a moment</p>

<p>of silence before they had moved off.  It was interrupted by the</p>

<p>crowing of a cock.  The white one with the rose comb had come and</p>

<p>settled on the palings in front of the house, within a few yards of</p>

<p>them, and his notes thrilled their ears through, dwindling away like</p>

<p>echoes down a valley of rocks.</p>

<p>"Oh?" said Mrs Crick.  "An afternoon crow!"</p>

<p>Two men were standing by the yard gate, holding it open.</p>

<p>"That's bad," one murmured to the other, not thinking that the words</p>

<p>could be heard by the group at the door-wicket.</p>

<p>The cock crew again--straight towards Clare.</p>

<p>"Well!" said the dairyman.</p>

<p>"I don't like to hear him!" said Tess to her husband.  "Tell the man</p>

<p>to drive on.  Goodbye, goodbye!"</p>

<p>The cock crew again.</p>

<p>"Hoosh!  Just you be off, sir, or I'll twist your neck!" said the</p>

<p>dairyman with some irritation, turning to the bird and driving him</p>

<p>away.  And to his wife as they went indoors: "Now, to think o' that</p>

<p>just to-day!  I've not heard his crow of an afternoon all the year</p>

<p>afore."</p>

<p>"It only means a change in the weather," said she; "not what you</p>

<p>think: 'tis impossible!"</p>

<p>XXXIV</p>

<p>They drove by the level road along the valley to a distance of a few</p>

<p>miles, and, reaching Wellbridge, turned away from the village to the</p>

<p>left, and over the great Elizabethan bridge which gives the place</p>

<p>half its name.  Immediately behind it stood the house wherein they</p>

<p>had engaged lodgings, whose exterior features are so well known to</p>

<p>all travellers through the Froom Valley; once portion of a fine</p>

<p>manorial residence, and the property and seat of a d'Urberville, but</p>

<p>since its partial demolition a farmhouse.</p>

<p>"Welcome to one of your ancestral mansions!" said Clare as he handed</p>

<p>her down.  But he regretted the pleasantry; it was too near a satire.</p>

<p>On entering they found that, though they had only engaged a couple</p>

<p>of rooms, the farmer had taken advantage of their proposed presence</p>

<p>during the coming days to pay a New Year's visit to some friends,</p>

<p>leaving a woman from a neighbouring cottage to minister to their</p>

<p>few wants.  The absoluteness of possession pleased them, and they</p>

<p>realized it as the first moment of their experience under their own</p>

<p>exclusive roof-tree.</p>

<p>But he found that the mouldy old habitation somewhat depressed his</p>

<p>bride.  When the carriage was gone they ascended the stairs to wash</p>

<p>their hands, the charwoman showing the way.  On the landing Tess</p>

<p>stopped and started.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" said he.</p>

<p>"Those horrid women!" she answered with a smile.  "How they</p>

<p>frightened me."</p>

<p>He looked up, and perceived two life-size portraits on panels built</p>

<p>into the masonry.  As all visitors to the mansion are aware, these</p>

<p>paintings represent women of middle age, of a date some two hundred</p>

<p>years ago, whose lineaments once seen can never be forgotten.</p>

<p>The long pointed features, narrow eye, and smirk of the one, so</p>

<p>suggestive of merciless treachery; the bill-hook nose, large</p>

<p>teeth, and bold eye of the other suggesting arrogance to the point</p>

<p>of ferocity, haunt the beholder afterwards in his dreams.</p>

<p>"Whose portraits are those?" asked Clare of the charwoman.</p>

<p>"I have been told by old folk that they were ladies of the</p>

<p>d'Urberville family, the ancient lords of this manor," she said,</p>

<p>"Owing to their being builded into the wall they can't be moved</p>

<p>away."</p>

<p>The unpleasantness of the matter was that, in addition to their</p>

<p>effect upon Tess, her fine features were unquestionably traceable</p>

<p>in these exaggerated forms.  He said nothing of this, however, and,</p>

<p>regretting that he had gone out of his way to choose the house for</p>

<p>their bridal time, went on into the adjoining room.  The place having</p>

<p>been rather hastily prepared for them, they washed their hands in one</p>

<p>basin.  Clare touched hers under the water.</p>

<p>"Which are my fingers and which are yours?" he said, looking up.</p>

<p>"They are very much mixed."</p>

<p>"They are all yours," said she, very prettily, and endeavoured</p>

<p>to be gayer than she was.  He had not been displeased with her</p>

<p>thoughtfulness on such an occasion; it was what every sensible woman</p>

<p>would show: but Tess knew that she had been thoughtful to excess,</p>

<p>and struggled against it.</p>

<p>The sun was so low on that short last afternoon of the year that it</p>

<p>shone in through a small opening and formed a golden staff which</p>

<p>stretched across to her skirt, where it made a spot like a paint-mark</p>

<p>set upon her.  They went into the ancient parlour to tea, and</p>

<p>here they shared their first common meal alone.  Such was their</p>

<p>childishness, or rather his, that he found it interesting to use the</p>

<p>same bread-and-butter plate as herself, and to brush crumbs from her</p>

<p>lips with his own.  He wondered a little that she did not enter into</p>

<p>these frivolities with his own zest.</p>

<p>Looking at her silently for a long time; "She is a dear dear Tess,"</p>

<p>he thought to himself, as one deciding on the true construction of</p>

<p>a difficult passage.  "Do I realize solemnly enough how utterly and</p>

<p>irretrievably this little womanly thing is the creature of my good</p>

<p>or bad faith and fortune?  I think not.  I think I could not, unless</p>

<p>I were a woman myself.  What I am in worldly estate, she is.  What I</p>

<p>become, she must become.  What I cannot be, she cannot be.  And shall</p>

<p>I ever neglect her, or hurt her, or even forget to consider her?  God</p>

<p>forbid such a crime!"</p>

<p>They sat on over the tea-table waiting for their luggage, which the</p>

<p>dairyman had promised to send before it grew dark.  But evening began</p>

<p>to close in, and the luggage did not arrive, and they had brought</p>

<p>nothing more than they stood in.  With the departure of the sun the</p>

<p>calm mood of the winter day changed.  Out of doors there began noises</p>

<p>as of silk smartly rubbed; the restful dead leaves of the preceding</p>

<p>autumn were stirred to irritated resurrection, and whirled about</p>

<p>unwillingly, and tapped against the shutters.  It soon began to rain.</p>

<p>"That cock knew the weather was going to change," said Clare.</p>

<p>The woman who had attended upon them had gone home for the night, but</p>

<p>she had placed candles upon the table, and now they lit them.  Each</p>

<p>candle-flame drew towards the fireplace.</p>

<p>"These old houses are so draughty," continued Angel, looking at the</p>

<p>flames, and at the grease guttering down the sides.  "I wonder where</p>

<p>that luggage is.  We haven't even a brush and comb."</p>

<p>"I don't know," she answered, absent-minded.</p>

<p>"Tess, you are not a bit cheerful this evening--not at all as you</p>

<p>used to be.  Those harridans on the panels upstairs have unsettled</p>

<p>you.  I am sorry I brought you here.  I wonder if you really love me,</p>

<p>after all?"</p>

<p>He knew that she did, and the words had no serious intent; but she</p>

<p>was surcharged with emotion, and winced like a wounded animal.</p>

<p>Though she tried not to shed tears, she could not help showing one</p>

<p>or two.</p>

<p>"I did not mean it!" said he, sorry.  "You are worried at not having</p>

<p>your things, I know.  I cannot think why old Jonathan has not come</p>

<p>with them.  Why, it is seven o'clock?  Ah, there he is!"</p>

<p>A knock had come to the door, and, there being nobody else to answer</p>

<p>it, Clare went out.  He returned to the room with a small package in</p>

<p>his hand.</p>

<p>"It is not Jonathan, after all," he said.</p>

<p>"How vexing!" said Tess.</p>

<p>The packet had been brought by a special messenger, who had arrived</p>

<p>at Talbothays from Emminster Vicarage immediately after the departure</p>

<p>of the married couple, and had followed them hither, being under</p>

<p>injunction to deliver it into nobody's hands but theirs.  Clare</p>

<p>brought it to the light.  It was less than a foot long, sewed up in</p>

<p>canvas, sealed in red wax with his father's seal, and directed in his</p>

<p>father's hand to "Mrs Angel Clare."</p>

<p>"It is a little wedding-present for you, Tess," said he, handing it</p>

<p>to her.  "How thoughtful they are!"</p>

<p>Tess looked a little flustered as she took it.</p>

<p>"I think I would rather have you open it, dearest," said she, turning</p>

<p>over the parcel.  "I don't like to break those great seals; they look</p>

<p>so serious.  Please open it for me!"</p>

<p>He undid the parcel.  Inside was a case of morocco leather, on the</p>

<p>top of which lay a note and a key.</p>

<p>The note was for Clare, in the following words:</p>

<p>   MY DEAR SON--</p>

<p>   Possibly you have forgotten that on the death of your</p>

<p>   godmother, Mrs Pitney, when you were a lad, she--vain,</p>

<p>   kind woman that she was--left to me a portion of the</p>

<p>   contents of her jewel-case in trust for your wife, if</p>

<p>   you should ever have one, as a mark of her affection</p>

<p>   for you and whomsoever you should choose.  This trust</p>

<p>   I have fulfilled, and the diamonds have been locked up</p>

<p>   at my banker's ever since.  Though I feel it to be a</p>

<p>   somewhat incongruous act in the circumstances, I am, as</p>

<p>   you will see, bound to hand over the articles to the</p>

<p>   woman to whom the use of them for her lifetime will now</p>

<p>   rightly belong, and they are therefore promptly sent.</p>

<p>   They become, I believe, heirlooms, strictly speaking,</p>

<p>   according to the terms of your godmother's will.  The</p>

<p>   precise words of the clause that refers to this matter</p>

<p>   are enclosed.</p>

<p>"I do remember," said Clare; "but I had quite forgotten."</p>

<p>Unlocking the case, they found it to contain a necklace, with</p>

<p>pendant, bracelets, and ear-rings; and also some other small</p>

<p>ornaments.</p>

<p>Tess seemed afraid to touch them at first, but her eyes sparkled for</p>

<p>a moment as much as the stones when Clare spread out the set.</p>

<p>"Are they mine?" she asked incredulously.</p>

<p>"They are, certainly," said he.</p>

<p>He looked into the fire.  He remembered how, when he was a lad of</p>

<p>fifteen, his godmother, the Squire's wife--the only rich person</p>

<p>with whom he had ever come in contact--had pinned her faith to his</p>

<p>success; had prophesied a wondrous career for him.  There had seemed</p>

<p>nothing at all out of keeping with such a conjectured career in the</p>

<p>storing up of these showy ornaments for his wife and the wives of</p>

<p>her descendants.  They gleamed somewhat ironically now.  "Yet why?"</p>

<p>he asked himself.  It was but a question of vanity throughout; and</p>

<p>if that were admitted into one side of the equation it should be</p>

<p>admitted into the other.  His wife was a d'Urberville: whom could</p>

<p>they become better than her?</p>

<p>Suddenly he said with enthusiasm--</p>

<p>"Tess, put them on--put them on!"  And he turned from the fire to</p>

<p>help her.</p>

<p>But as if by magic she had already donned them--necklace, ear-rings,</p>

<p>bracelets, and all.</p>

<p>"But the gown isn't right, Tess," said Clare.  "It ought to be a low</p>

<p>one for a set of brilliants like that."</p>

<p>"Ought it?" said Tess.</p>

<p>"Yes," said he.</p>

<p>He suggested to her how to tuck in the upper edge of her bodice, so</p>

<p>as to make it roughly approximate to the cut for evening wear; and</p>

<p>when she had done this, and the pendant to the necklace hung isolated</p>

<p>amid the whiteness of her throat, as it was designed to do, he</p>

<p>stepped back to survey her.</p>

<p>"My heavens," said Clare, "how beautiful you are!"</p>

<p>As everybody knows, fine feathers make fine birds; a peasant girl but</p>

<p>very moderately prepossessing to the casual observer in her simple</p>

<p>condition and attire will bloom as an amazing beauty if clothed as a</p>

<p>woman of fashion with the aids that Art can render; while the beauty</p>

<p>of the midnight crush would often cut but a sorry figure if placed</p>

<p>inside the field-woman's wrapper upon a monotonous acreage of</p>

<p>turnips on a dull day.  He had never till now estimated the artistic</p>

<p>excellence of Tess's limbs and features.</p>

<p>"If you were only to appear in a ball-room!" he said.  "But</p>

<p>no--no, dearest; I think I love you best in the wing-bonnet and</p>

<p>cotton-frock--yes, better than in this, well as you support these</p>

<p>dignities."</p>

<p>Tess's sense of her striking appearance had given her a flush of</p>

<p>excitement, which was yet not happiness.</p>

<p>"I'll take them off," she said, "in case Jonathan should see me.</p>

<p>They are not fit for me, are they?  They must be sold, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"Let them stay a few minutes longer.  Sell them?  Never. It would be</p>

<p>a breach of faith."</p>

<p>Influenced by a second thought she readily obeyed.  She had something</p>

<p>to tell, and there might be help in these.  She sat down with the</p>

<p>jewels upon her; and they again indulged in conjectures as to where</p>

<p>Jonathan could possibly be with their baggage.  The ale they had</p>

<p>poured out for his consumption when he came had gone flat with long</p>

<p>standing.</p>

<p>Shortly after this they began supper, which was already laid on</p>

<p>a side-table.  Ere they had finished there was a jerk in the</p>

<p>fire-smoke, the rising skein of which bulged out into the room, as if</p>

<p>some giant had laid his hand on the chimney-top for a moment.  It had</p>

<p>been caused by the opening of the outer door.  A heavy step was now</p>

<p>heard in the passage, and Angel went out.</p>

<p>"I couldn' make nobody hear at all by knocking," apologized Jonathan</p>

<p>Kail, for it was he at last; "and as't was raining out I opened the</p>

<p>door.  I've brought the things, sir."</p>

<p>"I am very glad to see them.  But you are very late."</p>

<p>"Well, yes, sir."</p>

<p>There was something subdued in Jonathan Kail's tone which had not</p>

<p>been there in the day, and lines of concern were ploughed upon his</p>

<p>forehead in addition to the lines of years.  He continued--</p>

<p>"We've all been gallied at the dairy at what might ha' been a most</p>

<p>terrible affliction since you and your Mis'ess--so to name her</p>

<p>now--left us this a'ternoon.  Perhaps you ha'nt forgot the cock's</p>

<p>afternoon crow?"</p>

<p>"Dear me;--what--"</p>

<p>"Well, some says it do mane one thing, and some another; but what's</p>

<p>happened is that poor little Retty Priddle hev tried to drown</p>

<p>herself."</p>

<p>"No! Really!  Why, she bade us goodbye with the rest--"</p>

<p>"Yes.  Well, sir, when you and your Mis'ess--so to name what she</p>

<p>lawful is--when you two drove away, as I say, Retty and Marian put on</p>

<p>their bonnets and went out; and as there is not much doing now, being</p>

<p>New Year's Eve, and folks mops and brooms from what's inside 'em,</p>

<p>nobody took much notice.  They went on to Lew-Everard, where they</p>

<p>had summut to drink, and then on they vamped to Dree-armed Cross,</p>

<p>and there they seemed to have parted, Retty striking across the</p>

<p>water-meads as if for home, and Marian going on to the next village,</p>

<p>where there's another public-house.  Nothing more was zeed or heard</p>

<p>o' Retty till the waterman, on his way home, noticed something by the</p>

<p>Great Pool; 'twas her bonnet and shawl packed up.  In the water he</p>

<p>found her.  He and another man brought her home, thinking a' was</p>

<p>dead; but she fetched round by degrees."</p>

<p>Angel, suddenly recollecting that Tess was overhearing this gloomy</p>

<p>tale, went to shut the door between the passage and the ante-room</p>

<p>to the inner parlour where she was; but his wife, flinging a shawl</p>

<p>round her, had come to the outer room and was listening to the man's</p>

<p>narrative, her eyes resting absently on the luggage and the drops of</p>

<p>rain glistening upon it.</p>

<p>"And, more than this, there's Marian; she's been found dead drunk</p>

<p>by the withy-bed--a girl who hev never been known to touch anything</p>

<p>before except shilling ale; though, to be sure, 'a was always a good</p>

<p>trencher-woman, as her face showed.  It seems as if the maids had</p>

<p>all gone out o' their minds!"</p>

<p>"And Izz?" asked Tess.</p>

<p>"Izz is about house as usual; but 'a do say 'a can guess how it</p>

<p>happened; and she seems to be very low in mind about it, poor maid,</p>

<p>as well she mid be.  And so you see, sir, as all this happened just</p>

<p>when we was packing your few traps and your Mis'ess's night-rail and</p>

<p>dressing things into the cart, why, it belated me."</p>

<p>"Yes.  Well, Jonathan, will you get the trunks upstairs, and drink a</p>

<p>cup of ale, and hasten back as soon as you can, in case you should be</p>

<p>wanted?"</p>

<p>Tess had gone back to the inner parlour, and sat down by the fire,</p>

<p>looking wistfully into it.  She heard Jonathan Kail's heavy footsteps</p>

<p>up and down the stairs till he had done placing the luggage, and</p>

<p>heard him express his thanks for the ale her husband took out to him,</p>

<p>and for the gratuity he received.  Jonathan's footsteps then died</p>

<p>from the door, and his cart creaked away.</p>

<p>Angel slid forward the massive oak bar which secured the door, and</p>

<p>coming in to where she sat over the hearth, pressed her cheeks</p>

<p>between his hands from behind.  He expected her to jump up gaily and</p>

<p>unpack the toilet-gear that she had been so anxious about, but as she</p>

<p>did not rise he sat down with her in the firelight, the candles on</p>

<p>the supper-table being too thin and glimmering to interfere with its</p>

<p>glow.</p>

<p>"I am so sorry you should have heard this sad story about the girls,"</p>

<p>he said.  "Still, don't let it depress you.  Retty was naturally</p>

<p>morbid, you know."</p>

<p>"Without the least cause," said Tess.  "While they who have cause to</p>

<p>be, hide it, and pretend they are not."</p>

<p>This incident had turned the scale for her.  They were simple and</p>

<p>innocent girls on whom the unhappiness of unrequited love had fallen;</p>

<p>they had deserved better at the hands of Fate.  She had deserved</p>

<p>worse--yet she was the chosen one.  It was wicked of her to take all</p>

<p>without paying.  She would pay to the uttermost farthing; she would</p>

<p>tell, there and then.  This final determination she came to when she</p>

<p>looked into the fire, he holding her hand.</p>

<p>A steady glare from the now flameless embers painted the sides</p>

<p>and back of the fireplace with its colour, and the well-polished</p>

<p>andirons, and the old brass tongs that would not meet.  The underside</p>

<p>of the mantel-shelf was flushed with the high-coloured light, and</p>

<p>the legs of the table nearest the fire.  Tess's face and neck</p>

<p>reflected the same warmth, which each gem turned into an Aldebaran</p>

<p>or a Sirius--a constellation of white, red, and green flashes, that</p>

<p>interchanged their hues with her every pulsation.</p>

<p>"Do you remember what we said to each other this morning about</p>

<p>telling our faults?" he asked abruptly, finding that she still</p>

<p>remained immovable.  "We spoke lightly perhaps, and you may well</p>

<p>have done so.  But for me it was no light promise.  I want to make</p>

<p>a confession to you, Love."</p>

<p>This, from him, so unexpectedly apposite, had the effect upon her of</p>

<p>a Providential interposition.</p>

<p>"You have to confess something?" she said quickly, and even with</p>

<p>gladness and relief.</p>

<p>"You did not expect it?  Ah--you thought too highly of me.  Now</p>

<p>listen.  Put your head there, because I want you to forgive me, and</p>

<p>not to be indignant with me for not telling you before, as perhaps</p>

<p>I ought to have done."</p>

<p>How strange it was!  He seemed to be her double.  She did not speak,</p>

<p>and Clare went on--</p>

<p>"I did not mention it because I was afraid of endangering my chance</p>

<p>of you, darling, the great prize of my life--my Fellowship I call</p>

<p>you.  My brother's Fellowship was won at his college, mine at</p>

<p>Talbothays Dairy.  Well, I would not risk it.  I was going to tell</p>

<p>you a month ago--at the time you agreed to be mine, but I could not;</p>

<p>I thought it might frighten you away from me.  I put it off; then I</p>

<p>thought I would tell you yesterday, to give you a chance at least of</p>

<p>escaping me.  But I did not.  And I did not this morning, when you</p>

<p>proposed our confessing our faults on the landing--the sinner that I</p>

<p>was!  But I must, now I see you sitting there so solemnly.  I wonder</p>

<p>if you will forgive me?"</p>

<p>"O yes!  I am sure that--"</p>

<p>"Well, I hope so.  But wait a minute.  You don't know. To begin at</p>

<p>the beginning.  Though I imagine my poor father fears that I am one</p>

<p>of the eternally lost for my doctrines, I am of course, a believer in</p>

<p>good morals, Tess, as much as you.  I used to wish to be a teacher of</p>

<p>men, and it was a great disappointment to me when I found I could not</p>

<p>enter the Church.  I admired spotlessness, even though I could lay no</p>

<p>claim to it, and hated impurity, as I hope I do now.  Whatever one</p>

<p>may think of plenary inspiration, one must heartily subscribe to</p>

<p>these words of Paul: 'Be thou an example--in word, in conversation,</p>

<p>in charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity.'  It is the only</p>

<p>safeguard for us poor human beings.  '_Integer vitae_,' says a Roman</p>

<p>poet, who is strange company for St Paul--</p>

<p>  "The man of upright life, from frailties free,</p>

<p>   Stands not in need of Moorish spear or bow.</p>

<p>"Well, a certain place is paved with good intentions, and having felt</p>

<p>all that so strongly, you will see what a terrible remorse it bred</p>

<p>in me when, in the midst of my fine aims for other people, I myself</p>

<p>fell."</p>

<p>He then told her of that time of his life to which allusion has been</p>

<p>made when, tossed about by doubts and difficulties in London, like a</p>

<p>cork on the waves, he plunged into eight-and-forty hours' dissipation</p>

<p>with a stranger.</p>

<p>"Happily I awoke almost immediately to a sense of my folly," he</p>

<p>continued.  "I would have no more to say to her, and I came home.  I</p>

<p>have never repeated the offence.  But I felt I should like to treat</p>

<p>you with perfect frankness and honour, and I could not do so without</p>

<p>telling this.  Do you forgive me?"</p>

<p>She pressed his hand tightly for an answer.</p>

<p>"Then we will dismiss it at once and for ever!--too painful as it is</p>

<p>for the occasion--and talk of something lighter."</p>

<p>"O, Angel--I am almost glad--because now YOU can forgive ME!  I have</p>

<p>not made my confession.  I have a confession, too--remember, I said</p>

<p>so."</p>

<p>"Ah, to be sure!  Now then for it, wicked little one."</p>

<p>"Perhaps, although you smile, it is as serious as yours, or more so."</p>

<p>"It can hardly be more serious, dearest."</p>

<p>"It cannot--O no, it cannot!"  She jumped up joyfully at the hope.</p>

<p>"No, it cannot be more serious, certainly," she cried, "because 'tis</p>

<p>just the same! I will tell you now."</p>

<p>She sat down again.</p>

<p>Their hands were still joined.  The ashes under the grate were lit</p>

<p>by the fire vertically, like a torrid waste.  Imagination might have</p>

<p>beheld a Last Day luridness in this red-coaled glow, which fell on</p>

<p>his face and hand, and on hers, peering into the loose hair about her</p>

<p>brow, and firing the delicate skin underneath.  A large shadow of her</p>

<p>shape rose upon the wall and ceiling.  She bent forward, at which</p>

<p>each diamond on her neck gave a sinister wink like a toad's; and</p>

<p>pressing her forehead against his temple she entered on her story of</p>

<p>her acquaintance with Alec d'Urberville and its results, murmuring</p>

<p>the words without flinching, and with her eyelids drooping down.</p>

<p>END OF PHASE THE FOURTH</p><empty-line /><p>Phase the Fifth: The Woman Pays</p>

<p>XXXV</p>

<p>Her narrative ended; even its re-assertions and secondary</p>

<p>explanations were done.  Tess's voice throughout had hardly risen</p>

<p>higher than its opening tone; there had been no exculpatory phrase of</p>

<p>any kind, and she had not wept.</p>

<p>But the complexion even of external things seemed to suffer</p>

<p>transmutation as her announcement progressed.  The fire in the grate</p>

<p>looked impish--demoniacally funny, as if it did not care in the least</p>

<p>about her strait.  The fender grinned idly, as if it too did not</p>

<p>care.  The light from the water-bottle was merely engaged in a</p>

<p>chromatic problem.  All material objects around announced their</p>

<p>irresponsibility with terrible iteration.  And yet nothing had</p>

<p>changed since the moments when he had been kissing her; or rather,</p>

<p>nothing in the substance of things.  But the essence of things had</p>

<p>changed.</p>

<p>When she ceased, the auricular impressions from their previous</p>

<p>endearments seemed to hustle away into the corner of their brains,</p>

<p>repeating themselves as echoes from a time of supremely purblind</p>

<p>foolishness.</p>

<p>Clare performed the irrelevant act of stirring the fire; the</p>

<p>intelligence had not even yet got to the bottom of him.  After</p>

<p>stirring the embers he rose to his feet; all the force of her</p>

<p>disclosure had imparted itself now.  His face had withered.  In the</p>

<p>strenuousness of his concentration he treadled fitfully on the floor.</p>

<p>He could not, by any contrivance, think closely enough; that was the</p>

<p>meaning of his vague movement.  When he spoke it was in the most</p>

<p>inadequate, commonplace voice of the many varied tones she had heard</p>

<p>from him.</p>

<p>"Tess!"</p>

<p>"Yes, dearest."</p>

<p>"Am I to believe this?  From your manner I am to take it as true.</p>

<p>O you cannot be out of your mind!  You ought to be!  Yet you are</p>

<p>not...  My wife, my Tess--nothing in you warrants such a supposition</p>

<p>as that?"</p>

<p>"I am not out of my mind," she said.</p>

<p>"And yet--"  He looked vacantly at her, to resume with dazed senses:</p>

<p>"Why didn't you tell me before? Ah, yes, you would have told me, in a</p>

<p>way--but I hindered you, I remember!"</p>

<p>These and other of his words were nothing but the perfunctory babble</p>

<p>of the surface while the depths remained paralyzed.  He turned away,</p>

<p>and bent over a chair.  Tess followed him to the middle of the room,</p>

<p>where he was, and stood there staring at him with eyes that did not</p>

<p>weep.  Presently she slid down upon her knees beside his foot, and</p>

<p>from this position she crouched in a heap.</p>

<p>"In the name of our love, forgive me!" she whispered with a dry</p>

<p>mouth.  "I have forgiven you for the same!"</p>

<p>And, as he did not answer, she said again--</p>

<p>"Forgive me as you are forgiven!  _I_ forgive YOU, Angel."</p>

<p>"You--yes, you do."</p>

<p>"But you do not forgive me?"</p>

<p>"O Tess, forgiveness does not apply to the case!  You were one</p>

<p>person; now you are another.  My God--how can forgiveness meet such</p>

<p>a grotesque--prestidigitation as that!"</p>

<p>He paused, contemplating this definition; then suddenly broke into</p>

<p>horrible laughter--as unnatural and ghastly as a laugh in hell.</p>

<p>"Don't--don't!  It kills me quite, that!" she shrieked.  "O have</p>

<p>mercy upon me--have mercy!"</p>

<p>He did not answer; and, sickly white, she jumped up.</p>

<p>"Angel, Angel! what do you mean by that laugh?" she cried out.  "Do</p>

<p>you know what this is to me?"</p>

<p>He shook his head.</p>

<p>"I have been hoping, longing, praying, to make you happy!  I have</p>

<p>thought what joy it will be to do it, what an unworthy wife I shall</p>

<p>be if I do not!  That's what I have felt, Angel!"</p>

<p>"I know that."</p>

<p>"I thought, Angel, that you loved me--me, my very self!  If it is</p>

<p>I you do love, O how can it be that you look and speak so?  It</p>

<p>frightens me!  Having begun to love you, I love you for ever--in all</p>

<p>changes, in all disgraces, because you are yourself.  I ask no more.</p>

<p>Then how can you, O my own husband, stop loving me?"</p>

<p>"I repeat, the woman I have been loving is not you."</p>

<p>"But who?"</p>

<p>"Another woman in your shape."</p>

<p>She perceived in his words the realization of her own apprehensive</p>

<p>foreboding in former times.  He looked upon her as a species of</p>

<p>imposter; a guilty woman in the guise of an innocent one.  Terror was</p>

<p>upon her white face as she saw it; her cheek was flaccid, and her</p>

<p>mouth had almost the aspect of a round little hole. The horrible</p>

<p>sense of his view of her so deadened her that she staggered, and he</p>

<p>stepped forward, thinking she was going to fall.</p>

<p>"Sit down, sit down," he said gently.  "You are ill; and it is</p>

<p>natural that you should be."</p>

<p>She did sit down, without knowing where she was, that strained look</p>

<p>still upon her face, and her eyes such as to make his flesh creep.</p>

<p>"I don't belong to you any more, then; do I, Angel?" she asked</p>

<p>helplessly.  "It is not me, but another woman like me that he loved,</p>

<p>he says."</p>

<p>The image raised caused her to take pity upon herself as one who was</p>

<p>ill-used.  Her eyes filled as she regarded her position further; she</p>

<p>turned round and burst into a flood of self-sympathetic tears.</p>

<p>Clare was relieved at this change, for the effect on her of what had</p>

<p>happened was beginning to be a trouble to him only less than the</p>

<p>woe of the disclosure itself.  He waited patiently, apathetically,</p>

<p>till the violence of her grief had worn itself out, and her rush of</p>

<p>weeping had lessened to a catching gasp at intervals.</p>

<p>"Angel," she said suddenly, in her natural tones, the insane, dry</p>

<p>voice of terror having left her now.  "Angel, am I too wicked for</p>

<p>you and me to live together?"</p>

<p>"I have not been able to think what we can do."</p>

<p>"I shan't ask you to let me live with you, Angel, because I have</p>

<p>no right to!  I shall not write to mother and sisters to say we be</p>

<p>married, as I said I would do; and I shan't finish the good-hussif'</p>

<p>I cut out and meant to make while we were in lodgings."</p>

<p>"Shan't you?"</p>

<p>"No, I shan't do anything, unless you order me to; and if you go away</p>

<p>from me I shall not follow 'ee; and if you never speak to me any more</p>

<p>I shall not ask why, unless you tell me I may."</p>

<p>"And if I order you to do anything?"</p>

<p>"I will obey you like your wretched slave, even if it is to lie down</p>

<p>and die."</p>

<p>"You are very good.  But it strikes me that there is a want of</p>

<p>harmony between your present mood of self-sacrifice and your past</p>

<p>mood of self-preservation."</p>

<p>These were the first words of antagonism.  To fling elaborate</p>

<p>sarcasms at Tess, however, was much like flinging them at a dog or</p>

<p>cat.  The charms of their subtlety passed by her unappreciated, and</p>

<p>she only received them as inimical sounds which meant that anger</p>

<p>ruled.  She remained mute, not knowing that he was smothering his</p>

<p>affection for her.  She hardly observed that a tear descended slowly</p>

<p>upon his cheek, a tear so large that it magnified the pores of the</p>

<p>skin over which it rolled, like the object lens of a microscope.</p>

<p>Meanwhile reillumination as to the terrible and total change that her</p>

<p>confession had wrought in his life, in his universe, returned to him,</p>

<p>and he tried desperately to advance among the new conditions in which</p>

<p>he stood.  Some consequent action was necessary; yet what?</p>

<p>"Tess," he said, as gently as he could speak, "I cannot stay--in this</p>

<p>room--just now. I will walk out a little way."</p>

<p>He quietly left the room, and the two glasses of wine that he had</p>

<p>poured out for their supper--one for her, one for him--remained on</p>

<p>the table untasted.  This was what their _agape_ had come to.  At</p>

<p>tea, two or three hours earlier, they had, in the freakishness of</p>

<p>affection, drunk from one cup.</p>

<p>The closing of the door behind him, gently as it had been pulled</p>

<p>to, roused Tess from her stupor.  He was gone; she could not stay.</p>

<p>Hastily flinging her cloak around her she opened the door and</p>

<p>followed, putting out the candles as if she were never coming back.</p>

<p>The rain was over and the night was now clear.</p>

<p>She was soon close at his heels, for Clare walked slowly and without</p>

<p>purpose.  His form beside her light gray figure looked black,</p>

<p>sinister, and forbidding, and she felt as sarcasm the touch of the</p>

<p>jewels of which she had been momentarily so proud.  Clare turned at</p>

<p>hearing her footsteps, but his recognition of her presence seemed</p>

<p>to make no difference to him, and he went on over the five yawning</p>

<p>arches of the great bridge in front of the house.</p>

<p>The cow and horse tracks in the road were full of water, the rain</p>

<p>having been enough to charge them, but not enough to wash them away.</p>

<p>Across these minute pools the reflected stars flitted in a quick</p>

<p>transit as she passed; she would not have known they were shining</p>

<p>overhead if she had not seen them there--the vastest things of the</p>

<p>universe imaged in objects so mean.</p>

<p>The place to which they had travelled to-day was in the same</p>

<p>valley as Talbothays, but some miles lower down the river; and the</p>

<p>surroundings being open, she kept easily in sight of him.  Away from</p>

<p>the house the road wound through the meads, and along these she</p>

<p>followed Clare without any attempt to come up with him or to attract</p>

<p>him, but with dumb and vacant fidelity.</p>

<p>At last, however, her listless walk brought her up alongside him, and</p>

<p>still he said nothing.  The cruelty of fooled honesty is often great</p>

<p>after enlightenment, and it was mighty in Clare now.  The outdoor air</p>

<p>had apparently taken away from him all tendency to act on impulse;</p>

<p>she knew that he saw her without irradiation--in all her bareness;</p>

<p>that Time was chanting his satiric psalm at her then--</p>

<p>   Behold, when thy face is made bare, he that loved thee</p>

<p>      shall hate;</p>

<p>   Thy face shall be no more fair at the fall of thy fate.</p>

<p>   For thy life shall fall as a leaf and be shed as the rain;</p>

<p>   And the veil of thine head shall be grief, and the crown</p>

<p>      shall be pain.</p>

<p>He was still intently thinking, and her companionship had now</p>

<p>insufficient power to break or divert the strain of thought.  What a</p>

<p>weak thing her presence must have become to him!  She could not help</p>

<p>addressing Clare.</p>

<p>"What have I done--what HAVE I done!  I have not told of anything</p>

<p>that interferes with or belies my love for you.  You don't think I</p>

<p>planned it, do you?  It is in your own mind what you are angry at,</p>

<p>Angel; it is not in me.  O, it is not in me, and I am not that</p>

<p>deceitful woman you think me!"</p>

<p>"H'm--well.  Not deceitful, my wife; but not the same.  No, not the</p>

<p>same.  But do not make me reproach you.  I have sworn that I will</p>

<p>not; and I will do everything to avoid it."</p>

<p>But she went on pleading in her distraction; and perhaps said things</p>

<p>that would have been better left to silence.</p>

<p>"Angel!--Angel!  I was a child--a child when it happened!  I knew</p>

<p>nothing of men."</p>

<p>"You were more sinned against than sinning, that I admit."</p>

<p>"Then will you not forgive me?"</p>

<p>"I do forgive you, but forgiveness is not all."</p>

<p>"And love me?"</p>

<p>To this question he did not answer.</p>

<p>"O Angel--my mother says that it sometimes happens so!--she knows</p>

<p>several cases where they were worse than I, and the husband has not</p>

<p>minded it much--has got over it at least.  And yet the woman had not</p>

<p>loved him as I do you!"</p>

<p>"Don't, Tess; don't argue.  Different societies, different manners.</p>

<p>You almost make me say you are an unapprehending peasant woman, who</p>

<p>have never been initiated into the proportions of social things.</p>

<p>You don't know what you say."</p>

<p>"I am only a peasant by position, not by nature!"</p>

<p>She spoke with an impulse to anger, but it went as it came.</p>

<p>"So much the worse for you.  I think that parson who unearthed your</p>

<p>pedigree would have done better if he had held his tongue.  I cannot</p>

<p>help associating your decline as a family with this other fact--of</p>

<p>your want of firmness.  Decrepit families imply decrepit wills,</p>

<p>decrepit conduct.  Heaven, why did you give me a handle for despising</p>

<p>you more by informing me of your descent!  Here was I thinking you a</p>

<p>new-sprung child of nature; there were you, the belated seedling of</p>

<p>an effete aristocracy!"</p>

<p>"Lots of families are as bad as mine in that!  Retty's family were</p>

<p>once large landowners, and so were Dairyman Billett's.  And the</p>

<p>Debbyhouses, who now are carters, were once the De Bayeux family.</p>

<p>You find such as I everywhere; 'tis a feature of our county, and I</p>

<p>can't help it."</p>

<p>"So much the worse for the county."</p>

<p>She took these reproaches in their bulk simply, not in their</p>

<p>particulars; he did not love her as he had loved her hitherto, and</p>

<p>to all else she was indifferent.</p>

<p>They wandered on again in silence.  It was said afterwards that a</p>

<p>cottager of Wellbridge, who went out late that night for a doctor,</p>

<p>met two lovers in the pastures, walking very slowly, without</p>

<p>converse, one behind the other, as in a funeral procession, and the</p>

<p>glimpse that he obtained of their faces seemed to denote that they</p>

<p>were anxious and sad.  Returning later, he passed them again in the</p>

<p>same field, progressing just as slowly, and as regardless of the hour</p>

<p>and of the cheerless night as before.  It was only on account of his</p>

<p>preoccupation with his own affairs, and the illness in his house,</p>

<p>that he did not bear in mind the curious incident, which, however, he</p>

<p>recalled a long while after.</p>

<p>During the interval of the cottager's going and coming, she had said</p>

<p>to her husband--</p>

<p>"I don't see how I can help being the cause of much misery to you all</p>

<p>your life.  The river is down there.  I can put an end to myself in</p>

<p>it.  I am not afraid."</p>

<p>"I don't wish to add murder to my other follies," he said.</p>

<p>"I will leave something to show that I did it myself--on account of</p>

<p>my shame.  They will not blame you then."</p>

<p>"Don't speak so absurdly--I wish not to hear it.  It is nonsense</p>

<p>to have such thoughts in this kind of case, which is rather one</p>

<p>for satirical laughter than for tragedy.  You don't in the least</p>

<p>understand the quality of the mishap.  It would be viewed in the</p>

<p>light of a joke by nine-tenths of the world if it were known. Please</p>

<p>oblige me by returning to the house, and going to bed."</p>

<p>"I will," said she dutifully.</p>

<p>They had rambled round by a road which led to the well-known ruins of</p>

<p>the Cistercian abbey behind the mill, the latter having, in centuries</p>

<p>past, been attached to the monastic establishment.  The mill still</p>

<p>worked on, food being a perennial necessity; the abbey had perished,</p>

<p>creeds being transient.  One continually sees the ministration of the</p>

<p>temporary outlasting the ministration of the eternal.  Their walk</p>

<p>having been circuitous, they were still not far from the house, and</p>

<p>in obeying his direction she only had to reach the large stone bridge</p>

<p>across the main river and follow the road for a few yards.  When she</p>

<p>got back, everything remained as she had left it, the fire being</p>

<p>still burning.  She did not stay downstairs for more than a minute,</p>

<p>but proceeded to her chamber, whither the luggage had been taken.</p>

<p>Here she sat down on the edge of the bed, looking blankly around,</p>

<p>and presently began to undress.  In removing the light towards the</p>

<p>bedstead its rays fell upon the tester of white dimity; something was</p>

<p>hanging beneath it, and she lifted the candle to see what it was.</p>

<p>A bough of mistletoe.  Angel had put it there; she knew that in an</p>

<p>instant. This was the explanation of that mysterious parcel which it</p>

<p>had been so difficult to pack and bring; whose contents he would not</p>

<p>explain to her, saying that time would soon show her the purpose</p>

<p>thereof.  In his zest and his gaiety he had hung it there.  How</p>

<p>foolish and inopportune that mistletoe looked now.</p>

<p>Having nothing more to fear, having scarce anything to hope, for that</p>

<p>he would relent there seemed no promise whatever, she lay down dully.</p>

<p>When sorrow ceases to be speculative, sleep sees her opportunity.</p>

<p>Among so many happier moods which forbid repose this was a mood which</p>

<p>welcomed it, and in a few minutes the lonely Tess forgot existence,</p>

<p>surrounded by the aromatic stillness of the chamber that had once,</p>

<p>possibly, been the bride-chamber of her own ancestry.</p>

<p>Later on that night Clare also retraced his steps to the house.</p>

<p>Entering softly to the sitting-room he obtained a light, and with the</p>

<p>manner of one who had considered his course he spread his rugs upon</p>

<p>the old horse-hair sofa which stood there, and roughly shaped it to</p>

<p>a sleeping-couch.  Before lying down he crept shoeless upstairs, and</p>

<p>listened at the door of her apartment.  Her measured breathing told</p>

<p>that she was sleeping profoundly.</p>

<p>"Thank God!" murmured Clare; and yet he was conscious of a pang of</p>

<p>bitterness at the thought--approximately true, though not wholly</p>

<p>so--that having shifted the burden of her life to his shoulders, she</p>

<p>was now reposing without care.</p>

<p>He turned away to descend; then, irresolute, faced round to her</p>

<p>door again.  In the act he caught sight of one of the d'Urberville</p>

<p>dames, whose portrait was immediately over the entrance to Tess's</p>

<p>bedchamber.  In the candlelight the painting was more than</p>

<p>unpleasant.  Sinister design lurked in the woman's features, a</p>

<p>concentrated purpose of revenge on the other sex--so it seemed to</p>

<p>him then.  The Caroline bodice of the portrait was low--precisely as</p>

<p>Tess's had been when he tucked it in to show the necklace; and again</p>

<p>he experienced the distressing sensation of a resemblance between</p>

<p>them.</p>

<p>The check was sufficient.  He resumed his retreat and descended.</p>

<p>His air remained calm and cold, his small compressed mouth indexing</p>

<p>his powers of self-control; his face wearing still that terrible</p>

<p>sterile expression which had spread thereon since her disclosure.</p>

<p>It was the face of a man who was no longer passion's slave, yet who</p>

<p>found no advantage in his enfranchisement.  He was simply regarding</p>

<p>the harrowing contingencies of human experience, the unexpectedness</p>

<p>of things.  Nothing so pure, so sweet, so virginal as Tess had seemed</p>

<p>possible all the long while that he had adored her, up to an hour</p>

<p>ago; but</p>

<p>       The little less, and what worlds away!</p>

<p>He argued erroneously when he said to himself that her heart was not</p>

<p>indexed in the honest freshness of her face; but Tess had no advocate</p>

<p>to set him right.  Could it be possible, he continued, that eyes</p>

<p>which as they gazed never expressed any divergence from what the</p>

<p>tongue was telling, were yet ever seeing another world behind her</p>

<p>ostensible one, discordant and contrasting?</p>

<p>He reclined on his couch in the sitting-room, and extinguished the</p>

<p>light.  The night came in, and took up its place there, unconcerned</p>

<p>and indifferent; the night which had already swallowed up his</p>

<p>happiness, and was now digesting it listlessly; and was ready to</p>

<p>swallow up the happiness of a thousand other people with as little</p>

<p>disturbance or change of mien.</p>

<p>XXXVI</p>

<p>Clare arose in the light of a dawn that was ashy and furtive, as</p>

<p>though associated with crime.  The fireplace confronted him with its</p>

<p>extinct embers; the spread supper-table, whereon stood the two full</p>

<p>glasses of untasted wine, now flat and filmy; her vacated seat and</p>

<p>his own; the other articles of furniture, with their eternal look of</p>

<p>not being able to help it, their intolerable inquiry what was to be</p>

<p>done?  From above there was no sound; but in a few minutes there came</p>

<p>a knock at the door.  He remembered that it would be the neighbouring</p>

<p>cottager's wife, who was to minister to their wants while they</p>

<p>remained here.</p>

<p>The presence of a third person in the house would be extremely</p>

<p>awkward just now, and, being already dressed, he opened the window</p>

<p>and informed her that they could manage to shift for themselves that</p>

<p>morning.  She had a milk-can in her hand, which he told her to leave</p>

<p>at the door.  When the dame had gone away he searched in the back</p>

<p>quarters of the house for fuel, and speedily lit a fire.  There was</p>

<p>plenty of eggs, butter, bread, and so on in the larder, and Clare</p>

<p>soon had breakfast laid, his experiences at the dairy having rendered</p>

<p>him facile in domestic preparations.  The smoke of the kindled wood</p>

<p>rose from the chimney without like a lotus-headed column; local</p>

<p>people who were passing by saw it, and thought of the newly-married</p>

<p>couple, and envied their happiness.</p>

<p>Angel cast a final glance round, and then going to the foot of the</p>

<p>stairs, called in a conventional voice--</p>

<p>"Breakfast is ready!"</p>

<p>He opened the front door, and took a few steps in the morning air.</p>

<p>When, after a short space, he came back she was already in the</p>

<p>sitting-room mechanically readjusting the breakfast things.  As she</p>

<p>was fully attired, and the interval since his calling her had been</p>

<p>but two or three minutes, she must have been dressed or nearly so</p>

<p>before he went to summon her.  Her hair was twisted up in a large</p>

<p>round mass at the back of her head, and she had put on one of the</p>

<p>new frocks--a pale blue woollen garment with neck-frillings of</p>

<p>white.  Her hands and face appeared to be cold, and she had possibly</p>

<p>been sitting dressed in the bedroom a long time without any fire.</p>

<p>The marked civility of Clare's tone in calling her seemed to have</p>

<p>inspired her, for the moment, with a new glimmer of hope.  But it</p>

<p>soon died when she looked at him.</p>

<p>The pair were, in truth, but the ashes of their former fires.  To the</p>

<p>hot sorrow of the previous night had succeeded heaviness; it seemed</p>

<p>as if nothing could kindle either of them to fervour of sensation any</p>

<p>more.</p>

<p>He spoke gently to her, and she replied with a like</p>

<p>undemonstrativeness.  At last she came up to him, looking in his</p>

<p>sharply-defined face as one who had no consciousness that her own</p>

<p>formed a visible object also.</p>

<p>"Angel!" she said, and paused, touching him with her fingers lightly</p>

<p>as a breeze, as though she could hardly believe to be there in the</p>

<p>flesh the man who was once her lover.  Her eyes were bright, her pale</p>

<p>cheek still showed its wonted roundness, though half-dried tears had</p>

<p>left glistening traces thereon; and the usually ripe red mouth was</p>

<p>almost as pale as her cheek.  Throbbingly alive as she was still,</p>

<p>under the stress of her mental grief the life beat so brokenly that</p>

<p>a little further pull upon it would cause real illness, dull her</p>

<p>characteristic eyes, and make her mouth thin.</p>

<p>She looked absolutely pure.  Nature, in her fantastic trickery, had</p>

<p>set such a seal of maidenhood upon Tess's countenance that he gazed</p>

<p>at her with a stupefied air.</p>

<p>"Tess!  Say it is not true!  No, it is not true!"</p>

<p>"It is true."</p>

<p>"Every word?"</p>

<p>"Every word."</p>

<p>He looked at her imploringly, as if he would willingly have taken a</p>

<p>lie from her lips, knowing it to be one, and have made of it, by some</p>

<p>sort of sophistry, a valid denial. However, she only repeated--</p>

<p>"It is true."</p>

<p>"Is he living?" Angel then asked.</p>

<p>"The baby died."</p>

<p>"But the man?"</p>

<p>"He is alive."</p>

<p>A last despair passed over Clare's face.</p>

<p>"Is he in England?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>He took a few vague steps.</p>

<p>"My position--is this," he said abruptly.  "I thought--any man would</p>

<p>have thought--that by giving up all ambition to win a wife with</p>

<p>social standing, with fortune, with knowledge of the world, I should</p>

<p>secure rustic innocence as surely as I should secure pink cheeks;</p>

<p>but--However, I am no man to reproach you, and I will not."</p>

<p>Tess felt his position so entirely that the remainder had not been</p>

<p>needed.  Therein lay just the distress of it; she saw that he had</p>

<p>lost all round.</p>

<p>"Angel--I should not have let it go on to marriage with you if I had</p>

<p>not known that, after all, there was a last way out of it for you;</p>

<p>though I hoped you would never--"</p>

<p>Her voice grew husky.</p>

<p>"A last way?"</p>

<p>"I mean, to get rid of me.  You CAN get rid of me."</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"By divorcing me."</p>

<p>"Good heavens--how can you be so simple!  How can I divorce you?"</p>

<p>"Can't you--now I have told you?  I thought my confession would give</p>

<p>you grounds for that."</p>

<p>"O Tess--you are too, too--childish--unformed--crude, I suppose!  I</p>

<p>don't know what you are.  You don't understand the law--you don't</p>

<p>understand!"</p>

<p>"What--you cannot?"</p>

<p>"Indeed I cannot."</p>

<p>A quick shame mixed with the misery upon his listener's face.</p>

<p>"I thought--I thought," she whispered.  "O, now I see how wicked I</p>

<p>seem to you!  Believe me--believe me, on my soul, I never thought but</p>

<p>that you could!  I hoped you would not; yet I believed, without a</p>

<p>doubt, that you could cast me off if you were determined, and didn't</p>

<p>love me at--at--all!"</p>

<p>"You were mistaken," he said.</p>

<p>"O, then I ought to have done it, to have done it last night!  But I</p>

<p>hadn't the courage.  That's just like me!"</p>

<p>"The courage to do what?"</p>

<p>As she did not answer he took her by the hand.</p>

<p>"What were you thinking of doing?" he inquired.</p>

<p>"Of putting an end to myself."</p>

<p>"When?"</p>

<p>She writhed under this inquisitorial manner of his.  "Last night,"</p>

<p>she answered.</p>

<p>"Where?"</p>

<p>"Under your mistletoe."</p>

<p>"My good--!  How?" he asked sternly.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you, if you won't be angry with me!" she said, shrinking.</p>

<p>"It was with the cord of my box.  But I could not--do the last thing!</p>

<p>I was afraid that it might cause a scandal to your name."</p>

<p>The unexpected quality of this confession, wrung from her, and not</p>

<p>volunteered, shook him perceptibly.  But he still held her, and,</p>

<p>letting his glance fall from her face downwards, he said,  "Now,</p>

<p>listen to this.  You must not dare to think of such a horrible thing!</p>

<p>How could you!  You will promise me as your husband to attempt that</p>

<p>no more."</p>

<p>"I am ready to promise.  I saw how wicked it was."</p>

<p>"Wicked!  The idea was unworthy of you beyond description."</p>

<p>"But, Angel," she pleaded, enlarging her eyes in calm unconcern upon</p>

<p>him, "it was thought of entirely on your account--to set you free</p>

<p>without the scandal of the divorce that I thought you would have to</p>

<p>get.  I should never have dreamt of doing it on mine.  However, to</p>

<p>do it with my own hand is too good for me, after all.  It is you, my</p>

<p>ruined husband, who ought to strike the blow.  I think I should love</p>

<p>you more, if that were possible, if you could bring yourself to do</p>

<p>it, since there's no other way of escape for 'ee.  I feel I am so</p>

<p>utterly worthless!  So very greatly in the way!"</p>

<p>"Ssh!"</p>

<p>"Well, since you say no, I won't.  I have no wish opposed to yours."</p>

<p>He knew this to be true enough.  Since the desperation of the night</p>

<p>her activities had dropped to zero, and there was no further rashness</p>

<p>to be feared.</p>

<p>Tess tried to busy herself again over the breakfast-table with more</p>

<p>or less success, and they sat down both on the same side, so that</p>

<p>their glances did not meet.  There was at first something awkward</p>

<p>in hearing each other eat and drink, but this could not be escaped;</p>

<p>moreover, the amount of eating done was small on both sides.</p>

<p>Breakfast over, he rose, and telling her the hour at which he might</p>

<p>be expected to dinner, went off to the miller's in a mechanical</p>

<p>pursuance of the plan of studying that business, which had been his</p>

<p>only practical reason for coming here.</p>

<p>When he was gone Tess stood at the window, and presently saw his form</p>

<p>crossing the great stone bridge which conducted to the mill premises.</p>

<p>He sank behind it, crossed the railway beyond, and disappeared.</p>

<p>Then, without a sigh, she turned her attention to the room, and began</p>

<p>clearing the table and setting it in order.</p>

<p>The charwoman soon came.  Her presence was at first a strain upon</p>

<p>Tess, but afterwards an alleviation.  At half-past twelve she</p>

<p>left her assistant alone in the kitchen, and, returning to the</p>

<p>sitting-room, waited for the reappearance of Angel's form behind the</p>

<p>bridge.</p>

<p>About one he showed himself.  Her face flushed, although he was a</p>

<p>quarter of a mile off.  She ran to the kitchen to get the dinner</p>

<p>served by the time he should enter.  He went first to the room where</p>

<p>they had washed their hands together the day before, and as he</p>

<p>entered the sitting-room the dish-covers rose from the dishes as if</p>

<p>by his own motion.</p>

<p>"How punctual!" he said.</p>

<p>"Yes.  I saw you coming over the bridge," said she.</p>

<p>The meal was passed in commonplace talk of what he had been doing</p>

<p>during the morning at the Abbey Mill, of the methods of bolting and</p>

<p>the old-fashioned machinery, which he feared would not enlighten him</p>

<p>greatly on modern improved methods, some of it seeming to have been</p>

<p>in use ever since the days it ground for the monks in the adjoining</p>

<p>conventual buildings--now a heap of ruins.  He left the house again</p>

<p>in the course of an hour, coming home at dusk, and occupying himself</p>

<p>through the evening with his papers.  She feared she was in the way</p>

<p>and, when the old woman was gone, retired to the kitchen, where she</p>

<p>made herself busy as well as she could for more than an hour.</p>

<p>Clare's shape appeared at the door. "You must not work like this," he</p>

<p>said.  "You are not my servant; you are my wife."</p>

<p>She raised her eyes, and brightened somewhat.  "I may think myself</p>

<p>that--indeed?" she murmured, in piteous raillery.  "You mean in name!</p>

<p>Well, I don't want to be anything more."</p>

<p>"You MAY think so, Tess!  You are.  What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," she said hastily, with tears in her accents.  "I</p>

<p>thought I--because I am not respectable, I mean.  I told you I</p>

<p>thought I was not respectable enough long ago--and on that account</p>

<p>I didn't want to marry you, only--only you urged me!"</p>

<p>She broke into sobs, and turned her back to him.  It would almost</p>

<p>have won round any man but Angel Clare.  Within the remote depths of</p>

<p>his constitution, so gentle and affectionate as he was in general,</p>

<p>there lay hidden a hard logical deposit, like a vein of metal in a</p>

<p>soft loam, which turned the edge of everything that attempted to</p>

<p>traverse it.  It had blocked his acceptance of the Church; it blocked</p>

<p>his acceptance of Tess.  Moreover, his affection itself was less fire</p>

<p>than radiance, and, with regard to the other sex, when he ceased</p>

<p>to believe he ceased to follow: contrasting in this with many</p>

<p>impressionable natures, who remain sensuously infatuated with what</p>

<p>they intellectually despise.  He waited till her sobbing ceased.</p>

<p>"I wish half the women in England were as respectable as you," he</p>

<p>said, in an ebullition of bitterness against womankind in general.</p>

<p>"It isn't a question of respectability, but one of principle!"</p>

<p>He spoke such things as these and more of a kindred sort to her,</p>

<p>being still swayed by the antipathetic wave which warps direct souls</p>

<p>with such persistence when once their vision finds itself mocked by</p>

<p>appearances.  There was, it is true, underneath, a back current of</p>

<p>sympathy through which a woman of the world might have conquered him.</p>

<p>But Tess did not think of this; she took everything as her deserts,</p>

<p>and hardly opened her mouth.  The firmness of her devotion to him was</p>

<p>indeed almost pitiful; quick-tempered as she naturally was, nothing</p>

<p>that he could say made her unseemly; she sought not her own; was not</p>

<p>provoked; thought no evil of his treatment of her.  She might just</p>

<p>now have been Apostolic Charity herself returned to a self-seeking</p>

<p>modern world.</p>

<p>This evening, night, and morning were passed precisely as the</p>

<p>preceding ones had been passed.  On one, and only one, occasion did</p>

<p>she--the formerly free and independent Tess--venture to make any</p>

<p>advances.  It was on the third occasion of his starting after a meal</p>

<p>to go out to the flour-mill.  As he was leaving the table he said</p>

<p>"Goodbye," and she replied in the same words, at the same time</p>

<p>inclining her mouth in the way of his.  He did not avail himself of</p>

<p>the invitation, saying, as he turned hastily aside--</p>

<p>"I shall be home punctually."</p>

<p>Tess shrank into herself as if she had been struck.  Often enough had</p>

<p>he tried to reach those lips against her consent--often had he said</p>

<p>gaily that her mouth and breath tasted of the butter and eggs and</p>

<p>milk and honey on which she mainly lived, that he drew sustenance</p>

<p>from them, and other follies of that sort.  But he did not care for</p>

<p>them now.  He observed her sudden shrinking, and said gently--</p>

<p>"You know, I have to think of a course.  It was imperative that we</p>

<p>should stay together a little while, to avoid the scandal to you that</p>

<p>would have resulted from our immediate parting.  But you must see it</p>

<p>is only for form's sake."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Tess absently.</p>

<p>He went out, and on his way to the mill stood still, and wished for a</p>

<p>moment that he had responded yet more kindly, and kissed her once at</p>

<p>least.</p>

<p>Thus they lived through this despairing day or two; in the same</p>

<p>house, truly; but more widely apart than before they were lovers.  It</p>

<p>was evident to her that he was, as he had said, living with paralyzed</p>

<p>activities in his endeavour to think of a plan of procedure.  She</p>

<p>was awe-stricken to discover such determination under such apparent</p>

<p>flexibility.  His consistency was, indeed, too cruel.  She no longer</p>

<p>expected forgiveness now.  More than once she thought of going away</p>

<p>from him during his absence at the mill; but she feared that this,</p>

<p>instead of benefiting him, might be the means of hampering and</p>

<p>humiliating him yet more if it should become known.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Clare was meditating, verily.  His thought had been</p>

<p>unsuspended; he was becoming ill with thinking; eaten out with</p>

<p>thinking, withered by thinking; scourged out of all his former</p>

<p>pulsating, flexuous domesticity.  He walked about saying to himself,</p>

<p>"What's to be done--what's to be done?" and by chance she overheard</p>

<p>him.  It caused her to break the reserve about their future which had</p>

<p>hitherto prevailed.</p>

<p>"I suppose--you are not going to live with me--long, are you, Angel?"</p>

<p>she asked, the sunk corners of her mouth betraying how purely</p>

<p>mechanical were the means by which she retained that expression of</p>

<p>chastened calm upon her face.</p>

<p>"I cannot" he said, "without despising myself, and what is worse,</p>

<p>perhaps, despising you.  I mean, of course, cannot live with you</p>

<p>in the ordinary sense.  At present, whatever I feel, I do not</p>

<p>despise you.  And, let me speak plainly, or you may not see all my</p>

<p>difficulties.  How can we live together while that man lives?--he</p>

<p>being your husband in nature, and not I.  If he were dead it might</p>

<p>be different...  Besides, that's not all the difficulty; it lies in</p>

<p>another consideration--one bearing upon the future of other people</p>

<p>than ourselves.  Think of years to come, and children being born to</p>

<p>us, and this past matter getting known--for it must get known.  There</p>

<p>is not an uttermost part of the earth but somebody comes from it or</p>

<p>goes to it from elsewhere.  Well, think of wretches of our flesh and</p>

<p>blood growing up under a taunt which they will gradually get to feel</p>

<p>the full force of with their expanding years.  What an awakening</p>

<p>for them!  What a prospect!  Can you honestly say 'Remain' after</p>

<p>contemplating this contingency?  Don't you think we had better</p>

<p>endure the ills we have than fly to others?"</p>

<p>Her eyelids, weighted with trouble, continued drooping as before.</p>

<p>"I cannot say 'Remain,'" she answered, "I cannot; I had not thought</p>

<p>so far."</p>

<p>Tess's feminine hope--shall we confess it?--had been so obstinately</p>

<p>recuperative as to revive in her surreptitious visions of a</p>

<p>domiciliary intimacy continued long enough to break down his coldness</p>

<p>even against his judgement.  Though unsophisticated in the usual</p>

<p>sense, she was not incomplete; and it would have denoted deficiency</p>

<p>of womanhood if she had not instinctively known what an argument lies</p>

<p>in propinquity.  Nothing else would serve her, she knew, if this</p>

<p>failed.  It was wrong to hope in what was of the nature of strategy,</p>

<p>she said to herself: yet that sort of hope she could not extinguish.</p>

<p>His last representation had now been made, and it was, as she said,</p>

<p>a new view.  She had truly never thought so far as that, and his</p>

<p>lucid picture of possible offspring who would scorn her was one that</p>

<p>brought deadly convictions to an honest heart which was humanitarian</p>

<p>to its centre.  Sheer experience had already taught her that in some</p>

<p>circumstances there was one thing better than to lead a good life,</p>

<p>and that was to be saved from leading any life whatever.  Like all</p>

<p>who have been previsioned by suffering, she could, in the words of</p>

<p>M. Sully-Prudhomme, hear a penal sentence in the fiat, "You shall be</p>

<p>born," particularly if addressed to potential issue of hers.</p>

<p>Yet such is the vulpine slyness of Dame Nature, that, till now, Tess</p>

<p>had been hoodwinked by her love for Clare into forgetting it might</p>

<p>result in vitalizations that would inflict upon others what she had</p>

<p>bewailed as misfortune to herself.</p>

<p>She therefore could not withstand his argument.  But with the</p>

<p>self-combating proclivity of the supersensitive, an answer thereto</p>

<p>arose in Clare's own mind, and he almost feared it.  It was based</p>

<p>on her exceptional physical nature; and she might have used it</p>

<p>promisingly. She might have added besides: "On an Australian upland</p>

<p>or Texan plain, who is to know or care about my misfortunes, or to</p>

<p>reproach me or you?"  Yet, like the majority of women, she accepted</p>

<p>the momentary presentment as if it were the inevitable.  And she</p>

<p>may have been right.  The intuitive heart of woman knoweth not only</p>

<p>its own bitterness, but its husband's, and even if these assumed</p>

<p>reproaches were not likely to be addressed to him or to his by</p>

<p>strangers, they might have reached his ears from his own fastidious</p>

<p>brain.</p>

<p>It was the third day of the estrangement.  Some might risk the odd</p>

<p>paradox that with more animalism he would have been the nobler man.</p>

<p>We do not say it.  Yet Clare's love was doubtless ethereal to a</p>

<p>fault, imaginative to impracticability.  With these natures, corporal</p>

<p>presence is something less appealing than corporal absence; the</p>

<p>latter creating an ideal presence that conveniently drops the defects</p>

<p>of the real.  She found that her personality did not plead her cause</p>

<p>so forcibly as she had anticipated.  The figurative phrase was true:</p>

<p>she was another woman than the one who had excited his desire.</p>

<p>"I have thought over what you say," she remarked to him, moving her</p>

<p>forefinger over the tablecloth, her other hand, which bore the ring</p>

<p>that mocked them both, supporting her forehead.  "It is quite true,</p>

<p>all of it; it must be.  You must go away from me."</p>

<p>"But what can you do?"</p>

<p>"I can go home."</p>

<p>Clare had not thought of that.</p>

<p>"Are you sure?" he inquired.</p>

<p>"Quite sure.  We ought to part, and we may as well get it past and</p>

<p>done.  You once said that I was apt to win men against their better</p>

<p>judgement; and if I am constantly before your eyes I may cause you</p>

<p>to change your plans in opposition to your reason and wish; and</p>

<p>afterwards your repentance and my sorrow will be terrible."</p>

<p>"And you would like to go home?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I want to leave you, and go home."</p>

<p>"Then it shall be so."</p>

<p>Though she did not look up at him, she started.  There was a</p>

<p>difference between the proposition and the covenant, which she had</p>

<p>felt only too quickly.</p>

<p>"I feared it would come to this," she murmured, her countenance</p>

<p>meekly fixed.  "I don't complain, Angel, I--I think it best.  What</p>

<p>you said has quite convinced me.  Yes, though nobody else should</p>

<p>reproach me if we should stay together, yet somewhen, years hence,</p>

<p>you might get angry with me for any ordinary matter, and knowing what</p>

<p>you do of my bygones, you yourself might be tempted to say words, and</p>

<p>they might be overheard, perhaps by my own children.  O, what only</p>

<p>hurts me now would torture and kill me then! I will go--to-morrow."</p>

<p>"And I shall not stay here.  Though I didn't like to initiate it, I</p>

<p>have seen that it was advisable we should part--at least for a while,</p>

<p>till I can better see the shape that things have taken, and can write</p>

<p>to you."</p>

<p>Tess stole a glance at her husband.  He was pale, even tremulous;</p>

<p>but, as before, she was appalled by the determination revealed in the</p>

<p>depths of this gentle being she had married--the will to subdue the</p>

<p>grosser to the subtler emotion, the substance to the conception, the</p>

<p>flesh to the spirit.  Propensities, tendencies, habits, were as dead</p>

<p>leaves upon the tyrannous wind of his imaginative ascendency.</p>

<p>He may have observed her look, for he explained--</p>

<p>"I think of people more kindly when I am away from them"; adding</p>

<p>cynically, "God knows; perhaps we will shake down together some day,</p>

<p>for weariness; thousands have done it!"</p>

<p>That day he began to pack up, and she went upstairs and began to pack</p>

<p>also.  Both knew that it was in their two minds that they might part</p>

<p>the next morning for ever, despite the gloss of assuaging conjectures</p>

<p>thrown over their proceeding because they were of the sort to whom</p>

<p>any parting which has an air of finality is a torture.  He knew,</p>

<p>and she knew, that, though the fascination which each had exercised</p>

<p>over the other--on her part independently of accomplishments--would</p>

<p>probably in the first days of their separation be even more potent</p>

<p>than ever, time must attenuate that effect; the practical arguments</p>

<p>against accepting her as a housemate might pronounce themselves more</p>

<p>strongly in the boreal light of a remoter view.  Moreover, when two</p>

<p>people are once parted--have abandoned a common domicile and a common</p>

<p>environment--new growths insensibly bud upward to fill each vacated</p>

<p>place; unforeseen accidents hinder intentions, and old plans are</p>

<p>forgotten.</p>

<p>XXXVII</p>

<p>Midnight came and passed silently, for there was nothing to announce</p>

<p>it in the Valley of the Froom.</p>

<p>Not long after one o'clock there was a slight creak in the darkened</p>

<p>farmhouse once the mansion of the d'Urbervilles.  Tess, who used the</p>

<p>upper chamber, heard it and awoke.  It had come from the corner step</p>

<p>of the staircase, which, as usual, was loosely nailed.  She saw the</p>

<p>door of her bedroom open, and the figure of her husband crossed the</p>

<p>stream of moonlight with a curiously careful tread.  He was in his</p>

<p>shirt and trousers only, and her first flush of joy died when she</p>

<p>perceived that his eyes were fixed in an unnatural stare on vacancy.</p>

<p>When he reached the middle of the room he stood still and murmured in</p>

<p>tones of indescribable sadness--</p>

<p>"Dead! dead! dead!"</p>

<p>Under the influence of any strongly-disturbing force, Clare would</p>

<p>occasionally walk in his sleep, and even perform strange feats, such</p>

<p>as he had done on the night of their return from market just before</p>

<p>their marriage, when he re-enacted in his bedroom his combat with the</p>

<p>man who had insulted her.  Tess saw that continued mental distress</p>

<p>had wrought him into that somnambulistic state now.</p>

<p>Her loyal confidence in him lay so deep down in her heart, that,</p>

<p>awake or asleep, he inspired her with no sort of personal fear.  If</p>

<p>he had entered with a pistol in his hand he would scarcely have</p>

<p>disturbed her trust in his protectiveness.</p>

<p>Clare came close, and bent over her. "Dead, dead, dead!" he murmured.</p>

<p>After fixedly regarding her for some moments with the same gaze of</p>

<p>unmeasurable woe, he bent lower, enclosed her in his arms, and rolled</p>

<p>her in the sheet as in a shroud.  Then lifting her from the bed with</p>

<p>as much respect as one would show to a dead body, he carried her</p>

<p>across the room, murmuring--</p>

<p>"My poor, poor Tess--my dearest, darling Tess!  So sweet, so good, so</p>

<p>true!"</p>

<p>The words of endearment, withheld so severely in his waking hours,</p>

<p>were inexpressibly sweet to her forlorn and hungry heart.  If it had</p>

<p>been to save her weary life she would not, by moving or struggling,</p>

<p>have put an end to the position she found herself in.  Thus she lay</p>

<p>in absolute stillness, scarcely venturing to breathe, and, wondering</p>

<p>what he was going to do with her, suffered herself to be borne out</p>

<p>upon the landing.</p>

<p>"My wife--dead, dead!" he said.</p>

<p>He paused in his labours for a moment to lean with her against the</p>

<p>banister.  Was he going to throw her down?  Self-solicitude was near</p>

<p>extinction in her, and in the knowledge that he had planned to depart</p>

<p>on the morrow, possibly for always, she lay in his arms in this</p>

<p>precarious position with a sense rather of luxury than of terror.  If</p>

<p>they could only fall together, and both be dashed to pieces, how fit,</p>

<p>how desirable.</p>

<p>However, he did not let her fall, but took advantage of the support</p>

<p>of the handrail to imprint a kiss upon her lips--lips in the day-time</p>

<p>scorned.  Then he clasped her with a renewed firmness of hold, and</p>

<p>descended the staircase.  The creak of the loose stair did not awaken</p>

<p>him, and they reached the ground-floor safely.  Freeing one of his</p>

<p>hands from his grasp of her for a moment, he slid back the door-bar</p>

<p>and passed out, slightly striking his stockinged toe against the edge</p>

<p>of the door.  But this he seemed not to mind, and, having room for</p>

<p>extension in the open air, he lifted her against his shoulder, so</p>

<p>that he could carry her with ease, the absence of clothes taking much</p>

<p>from his burden.  Thus he bore her off the premises in the direction</p>

<p>of the river a few yards distant.</p>

<p>His ultimate intention, if he had any, she had not yet divined; and</p>

<p>she found herself conjecturing on the matter as a third person might</p>

<p>have done.  So easefully had she delivered her whole being up to him</p>

<p>that it pleased her to think he was regarding her as his absolute</p>

<p>possession, to dispose of as he should choose.  It was consoling,</p>

<p>under the hovering terror of to-morrow's separation, to feel that he</p>

<p>really recognized her now as his wife Tess, and did not cast her off,</p>

<p>even if in that recognition he went so far as to arrogate to himself</p>

<p>the right of harming her.</p>

<p>Ah! now she knew what he was dreaming of--that Sunday morning when he</p>

<p>had borne her along through the water with the other dairymaids, who</p>

<p>had loved him nearly as much as she, if that were possible, which</p>

<p>Tess could hardly admit.  Clare did not cross the bridge with her,</p>

<p>but proceeding several paces on the same side towards the adjoining</p>

<p>mill, at length stood still on the brink of the river.</p>

<p>Its waters, in creeping down these miles of meadowland, frequently</p>

<p>divided, serpentining in purposeless curves, looping themselves</p>

<p>around little islands that had no name, returning and re-embodying</p>

<p>themselves as a broad main stream further on.  Opposite the spot to</p>

<p>which he had brought her was such a general confluence, and the river</p>

<p>was proportionately voluminous and deep.  Across it was a narrow</p>

<p>foot-bridge; but now the autumn flood had washed the handrail away,</p>

<p>leaving the bare plank only, which, lying a few inches above the</p>

<p>speeding current, formed a giddy pathway for even steady heads; and</p>

<p>Tess had noticed from the window of the house in the day-time young</p>

<p>men walking across upon it as a feat in balancing.  Her husband had</p>

<p>possibly observed the same performance; anyhow, he now mounted the</p>

<p>plank, and, sliding one foot forward, advanced along it.</p>

<p>Was he going to drown her?  Probably he was.  The spot was lonely,</p>

<p>the river deep and wide enough to make such a purpose easy of</p>

<p>accomplishment.  He might drown her if he would; it would be better</p>

<p>than parting to-morrow to lead severed lives.</p>

<p>The swift stream raced and gyrated under them, tossing, distorting,</p>

<p>and splitting the moon's reflected face.  Spots of froth travelled</p>

<p>past, and intercepted weeds waved behind the piles.  If they could</p>

<p>both fall together into the current now, their arms would be so</p>

<p>tightly clasped together that they could not be saved; they would</p>

<p>go out of the world almost painlessly, and there would be no more</p>

<p>reproach to her, or to him for marrying her.  His last half-hour with</p>

<p>her would have been a loving one, while if they lived till he awoke,</p>

<p>his day-time aversion would return, and this hour would remain to be</p>

<p>contemplated only as a transient dream.</p>

<p>The impulse stirred in her, yet she dared not indulge it, to make a</p>

<p>movement that would have precipitated them both into the gulf.  How</p>

<p>she valued her own life had been proved; but his--she had no right to</p>

<p>tamper with it.  He reached the other side with her in safety.</p>

<p>Here they were within a plantation which formed the Abbey grounds,</p>

<p>and taking a new hold of her he went onward a few steps till they</p>

<p>reached the ruined choir of the Abbey-church.  Against the north wall</p>

<p>was the empty stone coffin of an abbot, in which every tourist with</p>

<p>a turn for grim humour was accustomed to stretch himself.  In this</p>

<p>Clare carefully laid Tess.  Having kissed her lips a second time he</p>

<p>breathed deeply, as if a greatly desired end were attained.  Clare</p>

<p>then lay down on the ground alongside, when he immediately fell into</p>

<p>the deep dead slumber of exhaustion, and remained motionless as a</p>

<p>log.  The spurt of mental excitement which had produced the effort</p>

<p>was now over.</p>

<p>Tess sat up in the coffin.  The night, though dry and mild for the</p>

<p>season, was more than sufficiently cold to make it dangerous for him</p>

<p>to remain here long, in his half-clothed state.  If he were left to</p>

<p>himself he would in all probability stay there till the morning, and</p>

<p>be chilled to certain death.  She had heard of such deaths after</p>

<p>sleep-walking.  But how could she dare to awaken him, and let him</p>

<p>know what he had been doing, when it would mortify him to discover</p>

<p>his folly in respect of her?  Tess, however, stepping out of her</p>

<p>stone confine, shook him slightly, but was unable to arouse him</p>

<p>without being violent.  It was indispensable to do something, for she</p>

<p>was beginning to shiver, the sheet being but a poor protection.  Her</p>

<p>excitement had in a measure kept her warm during the few minutes'</p>

<p>adventure; but that beatific interval was over.</p>

<p>It suddenly occurred to her to try persuasion; and accordingly she</p>

<p>whispered in his ear, with as much firmness and decision as she could</p>

<p>summon--</p>

<p>"Let us walk on, darling," at the same time taking him suggestively</p>

<p>by the arm.  To her relief, he unresistingly acquiesced; her words</p>

<p>had apparently thrown him back into his dream, which thenceforward</p>

<p>seemed to enter on a new phase, wherein he fancied she had risen as a</p>

<p>spirit, and was leading him to Heaven. Thus she conducted him by the</p>

<p>arm to the stone bridge in front of their residence, crossing which</p>

<p>they stood at the manor-house door.  Tess's feet were quite bare, and</p>

<p>the stones hurt her, and chilled her to the bone; but Clare was in</p>

<p>his woollen stockings, and appeared to feel no discomfort.</p>

<p>There was no further difficulty.  She induced him to lie down on his</p>

<p>own sofa bed, and covered him up warmly, lighting a temporary fire of</p>

<p>wood, to dry any dampness out of him.  The noise of these attentions</p>

<p>she thought might awaken him, and secretly wished that they might.</p>

<p>But the exhaustion of his mind and body was such that he remained</p>

<p>undisturbed.</p>

<p>As soon as they met the next morning Tess divined that Angel knew</p>

<p>little or nothing of how far she had been concerned in the night's</p>

<p>excursion, though, as regarded himself, he may have been aware that</p>

<p>he had not lain still.  In truth, he had awakened that morning from</p>

<p>a sleep deep as annihilation; and during those first few moments</p>

<p>in which the brain, like a Samson shaking himself, is trying its</p>

<p>strength, he had some dim notion of an unusual nocturnal proceeding.</p>

<p>But the realities of his situation soon displaced conjecture on the</p>

<p>other subject.</p>

<p>He waited in expectancy to discern some mental pointing; he knew that</p>

<p>if any intention of his, concluded over-night, did not vanish in the</p>

<p>light of morning, it stood on a basis approximating to one of pure</p>

<p>reason, even if initiated by impulse of feeling; that it was so</p>

<p>far, therefore, to be trusted.  He thus beheld in the pale morning</p>

<p>light the resolve to separate from her; not as a hot and indignant</p>

<p>instinct, but denuded of the passionateness which had made it scorch</p>

<p>and burn; standing in its bones; nothing but a skeleton, but none the</p>

<p>less there.  Clare no longer hesitated.</p>

<p>At breakfast, and while they were packing the few remaining articles,</p>

<p>he showed his weariness from the night's effort so unmistakeably that</p>

<p>Tess was on the point of revealing all that had happened; but the</p>

<p>reflection that it would anger him, grieve him, stultify him, to know</p>

<p>that he had instinctively manifested a fondness for her of which his</p>

<p>common-sense did not approve, that his inclination had compromised</p>

<p>his dignity when reason slept, again deterred her.  It was too much</p>

<p>like laughing at a man when sober for his erratic deeds during</p>

<p>intoxication.</p>

<p>It just crossed her mind, too, that he might have a faint</p>

<p>recollection of his tender vagary, and was disinclined to allude to</p>

<p>it from a conviction that she would take amatory advantage of the</p>

<p>opportunity it gave her of appealing to him anew not to go.</p>

<p>He had ordered by letter a vehicle from the nearest town, and</p>

<p>soon after breakfast it arrived.  She saw in it the beginning of</p>

<p>the end--the temporary end, at least, for the revelation of his</p>

<p>tenderness by the incident of the night raised dreams of a possible</p>

<p>future with him.  The luggage was put on the top, and the man drove</p>

<p>them off, the miller and the old waiting-woman expressing some</p>

<p>surprise at their precipitate departure, which Clare attributed to</p>

<p>his discovery that the mill-work was not of the modern kind which he</p>

<p>wished to investigate, a statement that was true so far as it went.</p>

<p>Beyond this there was nothing in the manner of their leaving to</p>

<p>suggest a fiasco, or that they were not going together to visit</p>

<p>friends.</p>

<p>Their route lay near the dairy from which they had started with such</p>

<p>solemn joy in each other a few days back, and as Clare wished to wind</p>

<p>up his business with Mr Crick, Tess could hardly avoid paying Mrs</p>

<p>Crick a call at the same time, unless she would excite suspicion of</p>

<p>their unhappy state.</p>

<p>To make the call as unobtrusive as possible, they left the carriage</p>

<p>by the wicket leading down from the high road to the dairy-house, and</p>

<p>descended the track on foot, side by side.  The withy-bed had been</p>

<p>cut, and they could see over the stumps the spot to which Clare had</p>

<p>followed her when he pressed her to be his wife; to the left the</p>

<p>enclosure in which she had been fascinated by his harp; and far away</p>

<p>behind the cow-stalls the mead which had been the scene of their</p>

<p>first embrace.  The gold of the summer picture was now gray, the</p>

<p>colours mean, the rich soil mud, and the river cold.</p>

<p>Over the barton-gate the dairyman saw them, and came forward,</p>

<p>throwing into his face the kind of jocularity deemed appropriate</p>

<p>in Talbothays and its vicinity on the re-appearance of the</p>

<p>newly-married.  Then Mrs Crick emerged from the house, and several</p>

<p>others of their old acquaintance, though Marian and Retty did not</p>

<p>seem to be there.</p>

<p>Tess valiantly bore their sly attacks and friendly humours, which</p>

<p>affected her far otherwise than they supposed.  In the tacit</p>

<p>agreement of husband and wife to keep their estrangement a secret</p>

<p>they behaved as would have been ordinary.  And then, although she</p>

<p>would rather there had been no word spoken on the subject, Tess had</p>

<p>to hear in detail the story of Marian and Retty.  The later had gone</p>

<p>home to her father's, and Marian had left to look for employment</p>

<p>elsewhere.  They feared she would come to no good.</p>

<p>To dissipate the sadness of this recital Tess went and bade all her</p>

<p>favourite cows goodbye, touching each of them with her hand, and as</p>

<p>she and Clare stood side by side at leaving, as if united body and</p>

<p>soul, there would have been something peculiarly sorry in their</p>

<p>aspect to one who should have seen it truly; two limbs of one life,</p>

<p>as they outwardly were, his arm touching hers, her skirts touching</p>

<p>him, facing one way, as against all the dairy facing the other,</p>

<p>speaking in their adieux as "we", and yet sundered like the poles.</p>

<p>Perhaps something unusually stiff and embarrassed in their attitude,</p>

<p>some awkwardness in acting up to their profession of unity, different</p>

<p>from the natural shyness of young couples, may have been apparent,</p>

<p>for when they were gone Mrs Crick said to her husband--</p>

<p>"How onnatural the brightness of her eyes did seem, and how they</p>

<p>stood like waxen images and talked as if they were in a dream!</p>

<p>Didn't it strike 'ee that 'twas so?  Tess had always sommat strange</p>

<p>in her, and she's not now quite like the proud young bride of a</p>

<p>well-be-doing man."</p>

<p>They re-entered the vehicle, and were driven along the roads towards</p>

<p>Weatherbury and Stagfoot Lane, till they reached the Lane inn, where</p>

<p>Clare dismissed the fly and man.  They rested here a while, and</p>

<p>entering the Vale were next driven onward towards her home by a</p>

<p>stranger who did not know their relations.  At a midway point, when</p>

<p>Nuttlebury had been passed, and where there were cross-roads, Clare</p>

<p>stopped the conveyance and said to Tess that if she meant to return</p>

<p>to her mother's house it was here that he would leave her.  As they</p>

<p>could not talk with freedom in the driver's presence he asked her to</p>

<p>accompany him for a few steps on foot along one of the branch roads;</p>

<p>she assented, and directing the man to wait a few minutes they</p>

<p>strolled away.</p>

<p>"Now, let us understand each other," he said gently.  "There is no</p>

<p>anger between us, though there is that which I cannot endure at</p>

<p>present.  I will try to bring myself to endure it.  I will let you</p>

<p>know where I go to as soon as I know myself.  And if I can bring</p>

<p>myself to bear it--if it is desirable, possible--I will come to you.</p>

<p>But until I come to you it will be better that you should not try to</p>

<p>come to me."</p>

<p>The severity of the decree seemed deadly to Tess; she saw his view of</p>

<p>her clearly enough; he could regard her in no other light than that</p>

<p>of one who had practised gross deceit upon him.  Yet could a woman</p>

<p>who had done even what she had done deserve all this?  But she could</p>

<p>contest the point with him no further.  She simply repeated after him</p>

<p>his own words.</p>

<p>"Until you come to me I must not try to come to you?"</p>

<p>"Just so."</p>

<p>"May I write to you?"</p>

<p>"O yes--if you are ill, or want anything at all.  I hope that will</p>

<p>not be the case; so that it may happen that I write first to you."</p>

<p>"I agree to the conditions, Angel; because you know best what my</p>

<p>punishment ought to be; only--only--don't make it more than I can</p>

<p>bear!"</p>

<p>That was all she said on the matter.  If Tess had been artful, had</p>

<p>she made a scene, fainted, wept hysterically, in that lonely lane,</p>

<p>notwithstanding the fury of fastidiousness with which he was</p>

<p>possessed, he would probably not have withstood her.  But her mood</p>

<p>of long-suffering made his way easy for him, and she herself was</p>

<p>his best advocate.  Pride, too, entered into her submission--which</p>

<p>perhaps was a symptom of that reckless acquiescence in chance too</p>

<p>apparent in the whole d'Urberville family--and the many effective</p>

<p>chords which she could have stirred by an appeal were left untouched.</p>

<p>The remainder of their discourse was on practical matters only.  He</p>

<p>now handed her a packet containing a fairly good sum of money, which</p>

<p>he had obtained from his bankers for the purpose.  The brilliants,</p>

<p>the interest in which seemed to be Tess's for her life only (if he</p>

<p>understood the wording of the will), he advised her to let him send</p>

<p>to a bank for safety; and to this she readily agreed.</p>

<p>These things arranged, he walked with Tess back to the carriage,</p>

<p>and handed her in.  The coachman was paid and told where to drive</p>

<p>her.  Taking next his own bag and umbrella--the sole articles he had</p>

<p>brought with him hitherwards--he bade her goodbye; and they parted</p>

<p>there and then.</p>

<p>The fly moved creepingly up a hill, and Clare watched it go with an</p>

<p>unpremeditated hope that Tess would look out of the window for one</p>

<p>moment.  But that she never thought of doing, would not have ventured</p>

<p>to do, lying in a half-dead faint inside.  Thus he beheld her recede,</p>

<p>and in the anguish of his heart quoted a line from a poet, with</p>

<p>peculiar emendations of his own--</p>

<p>    God's NOT in his heaven:</p>

<p>    All's WRONG with the world!</p>

<p>When Tess had passed over the crest of the hill he turned to go his</p>

<p>own way, and hardly knew that he loved her still.</p>

<p>XXXVIII</p>

<p>As she drove on through Blackmoor Vale, and the landscape of her</p>

<p>youth began to open around her, Tess aroused herself from her stupor.</p>

<p>Her first thought was how would she be able to face her parents?</p>

<p>She reached a turnpike-gate which stood upon the highway to the</p>

<p>village.  It was thrown open by a stranger, not by the old man who</p>

<p>had kept it for many years, and to whom she had been known; he had</p>

<p>probably left on New Year's Day, the date when such changes were</p>

<p>made.  Having received no intelligence lately from her home, she</p>

<p>asked the turnpike-keeper for news.</p>

<p>"Oh--nothing, miss," he answered.  "Marlott is Marlott still.  Folks</p>

<p>have died and that.  John Durbeyfield, too, hev had a daughter</p>

<p>married this week to a gentleman-farmer; not from John's own house,</p>

<p>you know; they was married elsewhere; the gentleman being of that</p>

<p>high standing that John's own folk was not considered well-be-doing</p>

<p>enough to have any part in it, the bridegroom seeming not to know</p>

<p>how't have been discovered that John is a old and ancient nobleman</p>

<p>himself by blood, with family skillentons in their own vaults to</p>

<p>this day, but done out of his property in the time o' the Romans.</p>

<p>However, Sir John, as we call 'n now, kept up the wedding-day as well</p>

<p>as he could, and stood treat to everybody in the parish; and John's</p>

<p>wife sung songs at The Pure Drop till past eleven o'clock."</p>

<p>Hearing this, Tess felt so sick at heart that she could not decide</p>

<p>to go home publicly in the fly with her luggage and belongings.  She</p>

<p>asked the turnpike-keeper if she might deposit her things at his</p>

<p>house for a while, and, on his offering no objection, she dismissed</p>

<p>her carriage, and went on to the village alone by a back lane.</p>

<p>At sight of her father's chimney she asked herself how she could</p>

<p>possibly enter the house?  Inside that cottage her relations were</p>

<p>calmly supposing her far away on a wedding-tour with a comparatively</p>

<p>rich man, who was to conduct her to bouncing prosperity; while here</p>

<p>she was, friendless, creeping up to the old door quite by herself,</p>

<p>with no better place to go to in the world.</p>

<p>She did not reach the house unobserved.  Just by the garden-hedge she</p>

<p>was met by a girl who knew her--one of the two or three with whom she</p>

<p>had been intimate at school.  After making a few inquiries as to how</p>

<p>Tess came there, her friend, unheeding her tragic look, interrupted</p>

<p>with--</p>

<p>"But where's thy gentleman, Tess?"</p>

<p>Tess hastily explained that he had been called away on business, and,</p>

<p>leaving her interlocutor, clambered over the garden-hedge, and thus</p>

<p>made her way to the house.</p>

<p>As she went up the garden-path she heard her mother singing by the</p>

<p>back door, coming in sight of which she perceived Mrs Durbeyfield on</p>

<p>the doorstep in the act of wringing a sheet.  Having performed this</p>

<p>without observing Tess, she went indoors, and her daughter followed</p>

<p>her.</p>

<p>The washing-tub stood in the same old place on the same old</p>

<p>quarter-hogshead, and her mother, having thrown the sheet aside, was</p>

<p>about to plunge her arms in anew.</p>

<p>"Why--Tess!--my chil'--I thought you was married!--married really and</p>

<p>truly this time--we sent the cider--"</p>

<p>"Yes, mother; so I am."</p>

<p>"Going to be?"</p>

<p>"No--I am married."</p>

<p>"Married!  Then where's thy husband?"</p>

<p>"Oh, he's gone away for a time."</p>

<p>"Gone away!  When was you married, then?  The day you said?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Tuesday, mother."</p>

<p>"And now 'tis on'y Saturday, and he gone away?"</p>

<p>"Yes, he's gone."</p>

<p>"What's the meaning o' that?  'Nation seize such husbands as you seem</p>

<p>to get, say I!"</p>

<p>"Mother!"  Tess went across to Joan Durbeyfield, laid her face upon</p>

<p>the matron's bosom, and burst into sobs.  "I don't know how to tell</p>

<p>'ee, mother!  You said to me, and wrote to me, that I was not to tell</p>

<p>him.  But I did tell him--I couldn't help it--and he went away!"</p>

<p>"O you little fool--you little fool!" burst out Mrs Durbeyfield,</p>

<p>splashing Tess and herself in her agitation.  "My good God! that ever</p>

<p>I should ha' lived to say it, but I say it again, you little fool!"</p>

<p>Tess was convulsed with weeping, the tension of so many days having</p>

<p>relaxed at last.</p>

<p>"I know it--I know--I know!" she gasped through her sobs.  "But,</p>

<p>O my mother, I could not help it!  He was so good--and I felt</p>

<p>the wickedness of trying to blind him as to what had happened!</p>

<p>If--if--it were to be done again--I should do the same.  I could</p>

<p>not--I dared not--so sin--against him!"</p>

<p>"But you sinned enough to marry him first!"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes; that's where my misery do lie!  But I thought he could get</p>

<p>rid o' me by law if he were determined not to overlook it.  And O, if</p>

<p>you knew--if you could only half know how I loved him--how anxious I</p>

<p>was to have him--and how wrung I was between caring so much for him</p>

<p>and my wish to be fair to him!"</p>

<p>Tess was so shaken that she could get no further, and sank, a</p>

<p>helpless thing, into a chair.</p>

<p>"Well, well; what's done can't be undone!  I'm sure I don't know why</p>

<p>children o' my bringing forth should all be bigger simpletons than</p>

<p>other people's--not to know better than to blab such a thing as</p>

<p>that, when he couldn't ha' found it out till too late!"  Here Mrs</p>

<p>Durbeyfield began shedding tears on her own account as a mother to</p>

<p>be pitied.  "What your father will say I don't know," she continued;</p>

<p>"for he's been talking about the wedding up at Rolliver's and The</p>

<p>Pure Drop every day since, and about his family getting back to their</p>

<p>rightful position through you--poor silly man!--and now you've made</p>

<p>this mess of it!  The Lord-a-Lord!"</p>

<p>As if to bring matters to a focus, Tess's father was heard</p>

<p>approaching at that moment.  He did not, however, enter immediately,</p>

<p>and Mrs Durbeyfield said that she would break the bad news to him</p>

<p>herself, Tess keeping out of sight for the present.  After her first</p>

<p>burst of disappointment Joan began to take the mishap as she had</p>

<p>taken Tess's original trouble, as she would have taken a wet holiday</p>

<p>or failure in the potato-crop; as a thing which had come upon them</p>

<p>irrespective of desert or folly; a chance external impingement to be</p>

<p>borne with; not a lesson.</p>

<p>Tess retreated upstairs and beheld casually that the beds had been</p>

<p>shifted, and new arrangements made.  Her old bed had been adapted for</p>

<p>two younger children.  There was no place here for her now.</p>

<p>The room below being unceiled she could hear most of what went on</p>

<p>there.  Presently her father entered, apparently carrying in a live</p>

<p>hen.  He was a foot-haggler now, having been obliged to sell his</p>

<p>second horse, and he travelled with his basket on his arm.  The hen</p>

<p>had been carried about this morning as it was often carried, to show</p>

<p>people that he was in his work, though it had lain, with its legs</p>

<p>tied, under the table at Rolliver's for more than an hour.</p>

<p>"We've just had up a story about--" Durbeyfield began, and thereupon</p>

<p>related in detail to his wife a discussion which had arisen at the</p>

<p>inn about the clergy, originated by the fact of his daughter having</p>

<p>married into a clerical family. "They was formerly styled 'sir',</p>

<p>like my own ancestry," he said, "though nowadays their true style,</p>

<p>strictly speaking, is 'clerk' only."  As Tess had wished that no</p>

<p>great publicity should be given to the event, he had mentioned no</p>

<p>particulars.  He hoped she would remove that prohibition soon.  He</p>

<p>proposed that the couple should take Tess's own name, d'Urberville,</p>

<p>as uncorrupted.  It was better than her husbands's.  He asked if any</p>

<p>letter had come from her that day.</p>

<p>Then Mrs Durbeyfield informed him that no letter had come, but Tess</p>

<p>unfortunately had come herself.</p>

<p>When at length the collapse was explained to him, a sullen</p>

<p>mortification, not usual with Durbeyfield, overpowered the influence</p>

<p>of the cheering glass.  Yet the intrinsic quality of the event moved</p>

<p>his touchy sensitiveness less than its conjectured effect upon the</p>

<p>minds of others.</p>

<p>"To think, now, that this was to be the end o't!" said Sir John.</p>

<p>"And I with a family vault under that there church of Kingsbere as</p>

<p>big as Squire Jollard's ale-cellar, and my folk lying there in sixes</p>

<p>and sevens, as genuine county bones and marrow as any recorded in</p>

<p>history.  And now to be sure what they fellers at Rolliver's and The</p>

<p>Pure Drop will say to me!  How they'll squint and glane, and say,</p>

<p>'This is yer mighty match is it; this is yer getting back to the true</p>

<p>level of yer forefathers in King Norman's time!' I feel this is too</p>

<p>much, Joan; I shall put an end to myself, title and all--I can bear</p>

<p>it no longer! ...  But she can make him keep her if he's married</p>

<p>her?"</p>

<p>"Why, yes. But she won't think o' doing that."</p>

<p>"D'ye think he really have married her?--or is it like the first--"</p>

<p>Poor Tess, who had heard as far as this, could not bear to hear more.</p>

<p>The perception that her word could be doubted even here, in her own</p>

<p>parental house, set her mind against the spot as nothing else could</p>

<p>have done.  How unexpected were the attacks of destiny!  And if her</p>

<p>father doubted her a little, would not neighbours and acquaintance</p>

<p>doubt her much?  O, she could not live long at home!</p>

<p>A few days, accordingly, were all that she allowed herself here, at</p>

<p>the end of which time she received a short note from Clare, informing</p>

<p>her that he had gone to the North of England to look at a farm.  In</p>

<p>her craving for the lustre of her true position as his wife, and to</p>

<p>hide from her parents the vast extent of the division between them,</p>

<p>she made use of this letter as her reason for again departing,</p>

<p>leaving them under the impression that she was setting out to join</p>

<p>him.  Still further to screen her husband from any imputation of</p>

<p>unkindness to her, she took twenty-five of the fifty pounds Clare</p>

<p>had given her, and handed the sum over to her mother, as if the wife</p>

<p>of a man like Angel Clare could well afford it, saying that it was a</p>

<p>slight return for the trouble and humiliation she had brought upon</p>

<p>them in years past.  With this assertion of her dignity she bade them</p>

<p>farewell; and after that there were lively doings in the Durbeyfield</p>

<p>household for some time on the strength of Tess's bounty, her mother</p>

<p>saying, and, indeed, believing, that the rupture which had arisen</p>

<p>between the young husband and wife had adjusted itself under their</p>

<p>strong feeling that they could not live apart from each other.</p>

<p>XXXIX</p>

<p>It was three weeks after the marriage that Clare found himself</p>

<p>descending the hill which led to the well-known parsonage of his</p>

<p>father.  With his downward course the tower of the church rose into</p>

<p>the evening sky in a manner of inquiry as to why he had come; and no</p>

<p>living person in the twilighted town seemed to notice him, still less</p>

<p>to expect him.  He was arriving like a ghost, and the sound of his</p>

<p>own footsteps was almost an encumbrance to be got rid of.</p>

<p>The picture of life had changed for him.  Before this time he had</p>

<p>known it but speculatively; now he thought he knew it as a practical</p>

<p>man; though perhaps he did not, even yet.  Nevertheless humanity</p>

<p>stood before him no longer in the pensive sweetness of Italian art,</p>

<p>but in the staring and ghastly attitudes of a Wiertz Museum, and with</p>

<p>the leer of a study by Van Beers.</p>

<p>His conduct during these first weeks had been desultory beyond</p>

<p>description.  After mechanically attempting to pursue his</p>

<p>agricultural plans as though nothing unusual had happened, in</p>

<p>the manner recommended by the great and wise men of all ages, he</p>

<p>concluded that very few of those great and wise men had ever gone so</p>

<p>far outside themselves as to test the feasibility of their counsel.</p>

<p>"This is the chief thing: be not perturbed," said the Pagan moralist.</p>

<p>That was just Clare's own opinion.  But he was perturbed.  "Let not</p>

<p>your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid," said the Nazarene.</p>

<p>Clare chimed in cordially; but his heart was troubled all the same.</p>

<p>How he would have liked to confront those two great thinkers, and</p>

<p>earnestly appeal to them as fellow-man to fellow-men, and ask them</p>

<p>to tell him their method!</p>

<p>His mood transmuted itself into a dogged indifference till at length</p>

<p>he fancied he was looking on his own existence with the passive</p>

<p>interest of an outsider.</p>

<p>He was embittered by the conviction that all this desolation had been</p>

<p>brought about by the accident of her being a d'Urberville.  When he</p>

<p>found that Tess came of that exhausted ancient line, and was not of</p>

<p>the new tribes from below, as he had fondly dreamed, why had he not</p>

<p>stoically abandoned her in fidelity to his principles?  This was what</p>

<p>he had got by apostasy, and his punishment was deserved.</p>

<p>Then he became weary and anxious, and his anxiety increased.  He</p>

<p>wondered if he had treated her unfairly.  He ate without knowing that</p>

<p>he ate, and drank without tasting.  As the hours dropped past, as the</p>

<p>motive of each act in the long series of bygone days presented itself</p>

<p>to his view, he perceived how intimately the notion of having Tess as</p>

<p>a dear possession was mixed up with all his schemes and words and</p>

<p>ways.</p>

<p>In going hither and thither he observed in the outskirts of a small</p>

<p>town a red-and-blue placard setting forth the great advantages of</p>

<p>the Empire of Brazil as a field for the emigrating agriculturist.</p>

<p>Land was offered there on exceptionally advantageous terms.  Brazil</p>

<p>somewhat attracted him as a new idea.  Tess could eventually join him</p>

<p>there, and perhaps in that country of contrasting scenes and notions</p>

<p>and habits the conventions would not be so operative which made life</p>

<p>with her seem impracticable to him here.  In brief he was strongly</p>

<p>inclined to try Brazil, especially as the season for going thither</p>

<p>was just at hand.</p>

<p>With this view he was returning to Emminster to disclose his plan</p>

<p>to his parents, and to make the best explanation he could make of</p>

<p>arriving without Tess, short of revealing what had actually separated</p>

<p>them.  As he reached the door the new moon shone upon his face, just</p>

<p>as the old one had done in the small hours of that morning when he</p>

<p>had carried his wife in his arms across the river to the graveyard</p>

<p>of the monks; but his face was thinner now.</p>

<p>Clare had given his parents no warning of his visit, and his arrival</p>

<p>stirred the atmosphere of the Vicarage as the dive of the kingfisher</p>

<p>stirs a quiet pool.  His father and mother were both in the</p>

<p>drawing-room, but neither of his brothers was now at home.  Angel</p>

<p>entered, and closed the door quietly behind him.</p>

<p>"But--where's your wife, dear Angel?" cried his mother.  "How you</p>

<p>surprise us!"</p>

<p>"She is at her mother's--temporarily.  I have come home rather in a</p>

<p>hurry because I've decided to go to Brazil."</p>

<p>"Brazil!  Why they are all Roman Catholics there surely!"</p>

<p>"Are they?  I hadn't thought of that."</p>

<p>But even the novelty and painfulness of his going to a Papistical</p>

<p>land could not displace for long Mr and Mrs Clare's natural interest</p>

<p>in their son's marriage.</p>

<p>"We had your brief note three weeks ago announcing that it had taken</p>

<p>place," said Mrs Clare, "and your father sent your godmother's gift</p>

<p>to her, as you know.  Of course it was best that none of us should be</p>

<p>present, especially as you preferred to marry her from the dairy, and</p>

<p>not at her home, wherever that may be.  It would have embarrassed</p>

<p>you, and given us no pleasure.  Your bothers felt that very strongly.</p>

<p>Now it is done we do not complain, particularly if she suits you for</p>

<p>the business you have chosen to follow instead of the ministry of the</p>

<p>Gospel. ...  Yet I wish I could have seen her first, Angel, or have</p>

<p>known a little more about her.  We sent her no present of our own,</p>

<p>not knowing what would best give her pleasure, but you must suppose</p>

<p>it only delayed.  Angel, there is no irritation in my mind or your</p>

<p>father's against you for this marriage; but we have thought it much</p>

<p>better to reserve our liking for your wife till we could see her.</p>

<p>And now you have not brought her.  It seems strange.  What has</p>

<p>happened?"</p>

<p>He replied that it had been thought best by them that she should to</p>

<p>go her parents' home for the present, whilst he came there.</p>

<p>"I don't mind telling you, dear mother," he said, "that I always</p>

<p>meant to keep her away from this house till I should feel she could</p>

<p>some with credit to you.  But this idea of Brazil is quite a recent</p>

<p>one.  If I do go it will be unadvisable for me to take her on this my</p>

<p>first journey.  She will remain at her mother's till I come back."</p>

<p>"And I shall not see her before you start?"</p>

<p>He was afraid they would not.  His original plan had been, as he had</p>

<p>said, to refrain from bringing her there for some little while--not</p>

<p>to wound their prejudices--feelings--in any way; and for other</p>

<p>reasons he had adhered to it.  He would have to visit home in the</p>

<p>course of a year, if he went out at once; and it would be possible</p>

<p>for them to see her before he started a second time--with her.</p>

<p>A hastily prepared supper was brought in, and Clare made further</p>

<p>exposition of his plans.  His mother's disappointment at not seeing</p>

<p>the bride still remained with her.  Clare's late enthusiasm for Tess</p>

<p>had infected her through her maternal sympathies, till she had almost</p>

<p>fancied that a good thing could come out of Nazareth--a charming</p>

<p>woman out of Talbothays Dairy. She watched her son as he ate.</p>

<p>"Cannot you describe her?  I am sure she is very pretty, Angel."</p>

<p>"Of that there can be no question!" he said, with a zest which</p>

<p>covered its bitterness.</p>

<p>"And that she is pure and virtuous goes without question?"</p>

<p>"Pure and virtuous, of course, she is."</p>

<p>"I can see her quite distinctly.  You said the other day that she was</p>

<p>fine in figure; roundly built; had deep red lips like Cupid's bow;</p>

<p>dark eyelashes and brows, an immense rope of hair like a ship's</p>

<p>cable; and large eyes violety-bluey-blackish."</p>

<p>"I did, mother."</p>

<p>"I quite see her.  And living in such seclusion she naturally had</p>

<p>scarce ever seen any young man from the world without till she saw</p>

<p>you."</p>

<p>"Scarcely."</p>

<p>"You were her first love?"</p>

<p>"Of course."</p>

<p>"There are worse wives than these simple, rosy-mouthed, robust girls</p>

<p>of the farm.  Certainly I could have wished--well, since my son is to</p>

<p>be an agriculturist, it is perhaps but proper that his wife should</p>

<p>have been accustomed to an outdoor life."</p>

<p>His father was less inquisitive; but when the time came for the</p>

<p>chapter from the Bible which was always read before evening prayers,</p>

<p>the Vicar observed to Mrs Clare--</p>

<p>"I think, since Angel has come, that it will be more appropriate to</p>

<p>read the thirty-first of Proverbs than the chapter which we should</p>

<p>have had in the usual course of our reading?"</p>

<p>"Yes, certainly," said Mrs Clare.  "The words of King Lemuel" (she</p>

<p>could cite chapter and verse as well as her husband).  "My dear son,</p>

<p>your father has decided to read us the chapter in Proverbs in praise</p>

<p>of a virtuous wife.  We shall not need to be reminded to apply the</p>

<p>words to the absent one.  May Heaven shield her in all her ways!"</p>

<p>A lump rose in Clare's throat.  The portable lectern was taken out</p>

<p>from the corner and set in the middle of the fireplace, the two old</p>

<p>servants came in, and Angel's father began to read at the tenth verse</p>

<p>of the aforesaid chapter--</p>

<p>   "Who can find a virtuous woman? for her price is far</p>

<p>   above rubies.  She riseth while it is yet night, and</p>

<p>   giveth meat to her household.  She girdeth her loins</p>

<p>   with strength and strengtheneth her arms.  She</p>

<p>   perceiveth that her merchandise is good; her candle</p>

<p>   goeth not out by night.  She looketh well to the ways</p>

<p>   of her household, and eateth not the bread of idleness.</p>

<p>   Her children arise up and call her blessed; her husband</p>

<p>   also, and he praiseth her.  Many daughters have done</p>

<p>   virtuously, but thou excellest them all."</p>

<p>When prayers were over, his mother said--</p>

<p>"I could not help thinking how very aptly that chapter your dear</p>

<p>father read applied, in some of its particulars, to the woman you</p>

<p>have chosen.  The perfect woman, you see, was a working woman; not an</p>

<p>idler; not a fine lady; but one who used her hands and her head and</p>

<p>her heart for the good of others.  'Her children arise up and call</p>

<p>her blessed; her husband also, and he praiseth her.  Many daughters</p>

<p>have done virtuously, but she excelleth them all.'  Well, I wish I</p>

<p>could have seen her, Angel.  Since she is pure and chaste, she would</p>

<p>have been refined enough for me."</p>

<p>Clare could bear this no longer.  His eyes were full of tears, which</p>

<p>seemed like drops of molten lead.  He bade a quick good night to</p>

<p>these sincere and simple souls whom he loved so well; who knew</p>

<p>neither the world, the flesh, nor the devil in their own hearts, only</p>

<p>as something vague and external to themselves.  He went to his own</p>

<p>chamber.</p>

<p>His mother followed him, and tapped at his door.  Clare opened it to</p>

<p>discover her standing without, with anxious eyes.</p>

<p>"Angel," she asked, "is there something wrong that you go away so</p>

<p>soon?  I am quite sure you are not yourself."</p>

<p>"I am not, quite, mother," said he.</p>

<p>"About her?  Now, my son, I know it is that--I know it is about her!</p>

<p>Have you quarrelled in these three weeks?"</p>

<p>"We have not exactly quarrelled," he said.  "But we have had a</p>

<p>difference--"</p>

<p>"Angel--is she a young woman whose history will bear investigation?"</p>

<p>With a mother's instinct Mrs Clare had put her finger on the kind of</p>

<p>trouble that would cause such a disquiet as seemed to agitate her</p>

<p>son.</p>

<p>"She is spotless!" he replied; and felt that if it had sent him to</p>

<p>eternal hell there and then he would have told that lie.</p>

<p>"Then never mind the rest.  After all, there are few purer things in</p>

<p>nature then an unsullied country maid. Any crudeness of manner which</p>

<p>may offend your more educated sense at first, will, I am sure,</p>

<p>disappear under the influence or your companionship and tuition."</p>

<p>Such terrible sarcasm of blind magnanimity brought home to Clare the</p>

<p>secondary perception that he had utterly wrecked his career by this</p>

<p>marriage, which had not been among his early thoughts after the</p>

<p>disclosure.  True, on his own account he cared very little about his</p>

<p>career; but he had wished to make it at least a respectable one on</p>

<p>account of his parents and brothers.  And now as he looked into the</p>

<p>candle its flame dumbly expressed to him that it was made to shine on</p>

<p>sensible people, and that it abhorred lighting the face of a dupe and</p>

<p>a failure.</p>

<p>When his agitation had cooled he would be at moments incensed with</p>

<p>his poor wife for causing a situation in which he was obliged to</p>

<p>practise deception on his parents.  He almost talked to her in his</p>

<p>anger, as if she had been in the room.  And then her cooing voice,</p>

<p>plaintive in expostulation, disturbed the darkness, the velvet touch</p>

<p>of her lips passed over his brow, and he could distinguish in the air</p>

<p>the warmth of her breath.</p>

<p>This night the woman of his belittling deprecations was thinking how</p>

<p>great and good her husband was.  But over them both there hung a</p>

<p>deeper shade than the shade which Angel Clare perceived, namely, the</p>

<p>shade of his own limitations.  With all his attempted independence of</p>

<p>judgement this advanced and well-meaning young man, a sample product</p>

<p>of the last five-and-twenty years, was yet the slave to custom and</p>

<p>conventionality when surprised back into his early teachings.  No</p>

<p>prophet had told him, and he was not prophet enough to tell himself,</p>

<p>that essentially this young wife of his was as deserving of the</p>

<p>praise of King Lemuel as any other woman endowed with the same</p>

<p>dislike of evil, her moral value having to be reckoned not by</p>

<p>achievement but by tendency.  Moreover, the figure near at hand</p>

<p>suffers on such occasion, because it shows up its sorriness without</p>

<p>shade; while vague figures afar off are honoured, in that their</p>

<p>distance makes artistic virtues of their stains.  In considering</p>

<p>what Tess was not, he overlooked what she was, and forgot that the</p>

<p>defective can be more than the entire.</p>

<p>XL</p>

<p>At breakfast Brazil was the topic, and all endeavoured to take a</p>

<p>hopeful view of Clare's proposed experiment with that country's soil,</p>

<p>notwithstanding the discouraging reports of some farm-labourers who</p>

<p>had emigrated thither and returned home within the twelve months.</p>

<p>After breakfast Clare went into the little town to wind up such</p>

<p>trifling matters as he was concerned with there, and to get from</p>

<p>the local bank all the money he possessed.  On his way back he</p>

<p>encountered Miss Mercy Chant by the church, from whose walls she</p>

<p>seemed to be a sort of emanation.  She was carrying an armful of</p>

<p>Bibles for her class, and such was her view of life that events which</p>

<p>produced heartache in others wrought beatific smiles upon her--an</p>

<p>enviable result, although, in the opinion of Angel, it was obtained</p>

<p>by a curiously unnatural sacrifice of humanity to mysticism.</p>

<p>She had learnt that he was about to leave England, and observed what</p>

<p>an excellent and promising scheme it seemed to be.</p>

<p>"Yes; it is a likely scheme enough in a commercial sense, no doubt,"</p>

<p>he replied.  "But, my dear Mercy, it snaps the continuity of</p>

<p>existence.  Perhaps a cloister would be preferable."</p>

<p>"A cloister!  O, Angel Clare!"</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"Why, you wicked man, a cloister implies a monk, and a monk Roman</p>

<p>Catholicism."</p>

<p>"And Roman Catholicism sin, and sin damnation.  Thou art in a parlous</p>

<p>state, Angel Clare."</p>

<p>"_I_ glory in my Protestantism!" she said severely.</p>

<p>Then Clare, thrown by sheer misery into one of the demoniacal moods</p>

<p>in which a man does despite to his true principles, called her close</p>

<p>to him, and fiendishly whispered in her ear the most heterodox ideas</p>

<p>he could think of.  His momentary laughter at the horror which</p>

<p>appeared on her fair face ceased when it merged in pain and anxiety</p>

<p>for his welfare.</p>

<p>"Dear Mercy," he said, "you must forgive me.  I think I am going</p>

<p>crazy!"</p>

<p>She thought that he was; and thus the interview ended, and Clare</p>

<p>re-entered the Vicarage.  With the local banker he deposited the</p>

<p>jewels till happier days should arise.  He also paid into the bank</p>

<p>thirty pounds--to be sent to Tess in a few months, as she might</p>

<p>require; and wrote to her at her parents' home in Blackmoor Vale to</p>

<p>inform her of what he had done.  This amount, with the sum he had</p>

<p>already placed in her hands--about fifty pounds--he hoped would be</p>

<p>amply sufficient for her wants just at present, particularly as in</p>

<p>an emergency she had been directed to apply to his father.</p>

<p>He deemed it best not to put his parents into communication with her</p>

<p>by informing them of her address; and, being unaware of what had</p>

<p>really happened to estrange the two, neither his father nor his</p>

<p>mother suggested that he should do so.  During the day he left the</p>

<p>parsonage, for what he had to complete he wished to get done quickly.</p>

<p>As the last duty before leaving this part of England it was necessary</p>

<p>for him to call at the Wellbridge farmhouse, in which he had spent</p>

<p>with Tess the first three days of their marriage, the trifle of rent</p>

<p>having to be paid, the key given up of the rooms they had occupied,</p>

<p>and two or three small articles fetched away that they had left</p>

<p>behind.  It was under this roof that the deepest shadow ever thrown</p>

<p>upon his life had stretched its gloom over him.  Yet when he had</p>

<p>unlocked the door of the sitting-room and looked into it, the memory</p>

<p>which returned first upon him was that of their happy arrival on a</p>

<p>similar afternoon, the first fresh sense of sharing a habitation</p>

<p>conjointly, the first meal together, the chatting by the fire with</p>

<p>joined hands.</p>

<p>The farmer and his wife were in the field at the moment of his visit,</p>

<p>and Clare was in the rooms alone for some time.  Inwardly swollen</p>

<p>with a renewal of sentiment that he had not quite reckoned with, he</p>

<p>went upstairs to her chamber, which had never been his.  The bed</p>

<p>was smooth as she had made it with her own hands on the morning of</p>

<p>leaving.  The mistletoe hung under the tester just as he had placed</p>

<p>it.  Having been there three or four weeks it was turning colour, and</p>

<p>the leaves and berries were wrinkled.  Angel took it down and crushed</p>

<p>it into the grate.  Standing there, he for the first time doubted</p>

<p>whether his course in this conjecture had been a wise, much less</p>

<p>a generous, one.  But had he not been cruelly blinded?  In the</p>

<p>incoherent multitude of his emotions he knelt down at the bedside</p>

<p>wet-eyed.  "O Tess!  If you had only told me sooner, I would have</p>

<p>forgiven you!" he mourned.</p>

<p>Hearing a footstep below, he rose and went to the top of the stairs.</p>

<p>At the bottom of the flight he saw a woman standing, and on her</p>

<p>turning up her face recognized the pale, dark-eyed Izz Huett.</p>

<p>"Mr Clare," she said, "I've called to see you and Mrs Clare, and to</p>

<p>inquire if ye be well.  I thought you might be back here again."</p>

<p>This was a girl whose secret he had guessed, but who had not yet</p>

<p>guessed his; an honest girl who loved him--one who would have made as</p>

<p>good, or nearly as good, a practical farmer's wife as Tess.</p>

<p>"I am here alone," he said; "we are not living here now."  Explaining</p>

<p>why he had come, he asked, "Which way are you going home, Izz?"</p>

<p>"I have no home at Talbothays Dairy now, sir," she said.</p>

<p>"Why is that?"</p>

<p>Izz looked down.</p>

<p>"It was so dismal there that I left!  I am staying out this way."</p>

<p>She pointed in a contrary direction, the direction in which he was</p>

<p>journeying.</p>

<p>"Well--are you going there now?  I can take you if you</p>

<p>wish for a lift."</p>

<p>Her olive complexion grew richer in hue.</p>

<p>"Thank 'ee, Mr Clare," she said.</p>

<p>He soon found the farmer, and settled the account for his rent and</p>

<p>the few other items which had to be considered by reason of the</p>

<p>sudden abandonment of the lodgings.  On Clare's return to his horse</p>

<p>and gig, Izz jumped up beside him.</p>

<p>"I am going to leave England, Izz," he said, as they drove on.</p>

<p>"Going to Brazil."</p>

<p>"And do Mrs Clare like the notion of such a journey?" she asked.</p>

<p>"She is not going at present--say for a year or so.  I am going out</p>

<p>to reconnoitre--to see what life there is like."</p>

<p>They sped along eastward for some considerable distance, Izz making</p>

<p>no observation.</p>

<p>"How are the others?" he inquired.  "How is Retty?"</p>

<p>"She was in a sort of nervous state when I zid her last; and so thin</p>

<p>and hollow-cheeked that 'a do seem in a decline.  Nobody will ever</p>

<p>fall in love wi' her any more," said Izz absently.</p>

<p>"And Marian?"</p>

<p>Izz lowered her voice.</p>

<p>"Marian drinks."</p>

<p>"Indeed!"</p>

<p>"Yes.  The dairyman has got rid of her."</p>

<p>"And you!"</p>

<p>"I don't drink, and I bain't in a decline.  But--I am no great things</p>

<p>at singing afore breakfast now!"</p>

<p>"How is that?  Do you remember how neatly you used to turn ''Twas</p>

<p>down in Cupid's Gardens' and 'The Tailor's Breeches' at morning</p>

<p>milking?"</p>

<p>"Ah, yes!  When you first came, sir, that was.  Not when you had been</p>

<p>there a bit."</p>

<p>"Why was that falling-off?"</p>

<p>Her black eyes flashed up to his face for one moment by way of</p>

<p>answer.</p>

<p>"Izz!--how weak of you--for such as I!" he said, and fell into</p>

<p>reverie.  "Then--suppose I had asked YOU to marry me?"</p>

<p>"If you had I should have said 'Yes', and you would have married a</p>

<p>woman who loved 'ee!"</p>

<p>"Really!"</p>

<p>"Down to the ground!" she whispered vehemently.  "O my God! did you</p>

<p>never guess it till now!"</p>

<p>By-and-by they reached a branch road to a village.</p>

<p>"I must get down.  I live out there," said Izz abruptly, never having</p>

<p>spoken since her avowal.</p>

<p>Clare slowed the horse.  He was incensed against his fate, bitterly</p>

<p>disposed towards social ordinances; for they had cooped him up in a</p>

<p>corner, out of which there was no legitimate pathway.  Why not be</p>

<p>revenged on society by shaping his future domesticities loosely,</p>

<p>instead of kissing the pedagogic rod of convention in this ensnaring</p>

<p>manner?</p>

<p>"I am going to Brazil alone, Izz," said he.  "I have separated from</p>

<p>my wife for personal, not voyaging, reasons.  I may never live with</p>

<p>her again.  I may not be able to love you; but--will you go with me</p>

<p>instead of her?"</p>

<p>"You truly wish me to go?"</p>

<p>"I do.  I have been badly used enough to wish for relief.  And you at</p>

<p>least love me disinterestedly."</p>

<p>"Yes--I will go," said Izz, after a pause.</p>

<p>"You will?  You know what it means, Izz?"</p>

<p>"It means that I shall live with you for the time you are over</p>

<p>there--that's good enough for me."</p>

<p>"Remember, you are not to trust me in morals now.  But I ought</p>

<p>to remind you that it will be wrong-doing in the eyes of</p>

<p>civilization--Western civilization, that is to say."</p>

<p>"I don't mind that; no woman do when it comes to agony-point, and</p>

<p>there's no other way!"</p>

<p>"Then don't get down, but sit where you are."</p>

<p>He drove past the cross-roads, one mile, two miles, without showing</p>

<p>any signs of affection.</p>

<p>"You love me very, very much, Izz?" he suddenly asked.</p>

<p>"I do--I have said I do!  I loved you all the time we was at the</p>

<p>dairy together!"</p>

<p>"More than Tess?"</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>"No," she murmured, "not more than she."</p>

<p>"How's that?"</p>

<p>"Because nobody could love 'ee more than Tess did! ...  She would</p>

<p>have laid down her life for 'ee.  I could do no more."</p>

<p>Like the prophet on the top of Peor, Izz Huett would fain have spoken</p>

<p>perversely at such a moment, but the fascination exercised over her</p>

<p>rougher nature by Tess's character compelled her to grace.</p>

<p>Clare was silent; his heart had risen at these straightforward words</p>

<p>from such an unexpected unimpeachable quarter.  In his throat was</p>

<p>something as if a sob had solidified there.  His ears repeated, "SHE</p>

<p>WOULD HAVE LAID DOWN HER LIFE FOR 'EE.  I COULD DO NO MORE!"</p>

<p>"Forget our idle talk, Izz," he said, turning the horse's head</p>

<p>suddenly.  "I don't know what I've been saying!  I will now drive</p>

<p>you back to where your lane branches off."</p>

<p>"So much for honesty towards 'ee!  O--how can I bear it--how can</p>

<p>I--how can I!"</p>

<p>Izz Huett burst into wild tears, and beat her forehead as she saw</p>

<p>what she had done.</p>

<p>"Do you regret that poor little act of justice to an absent one?</p>

<p>O, Izz, don't spoil it by regret!"</p>

<p>She stilled herself by degrees.</p>

<p>"Very well, sir.  Perhaps I didn't know what I was saying, either,</p>

<p>wh--when I agreed to go!  I wish--what cannot be!"</p>

<p>"Because I have a loving wife already."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes!  You have!"</p>

<p>They reached the corner of the lane which they had passed half an</p>

<p>hour earlier, and she hopped down.</p>

<p>"Izz--please, please forget my momentary levity!" he cried.  "It was</p>

<p>so ill-considered, so ill-advised!"</p>

<p>"Forget it?  Never, never!  O, it was no levity to me!"</p>

<p>He felt how richly he deserved the reproach that the wounded cry</p>

<p>conveyed, and, in a sorrow that was inexpressible, leapt down and</p>

<p>took her hand.</p>

<p>"Well, but, Izz, we'll part friends, anyhow?  You don't know what</p>

<p>I've had to bear!"</p>

<p>She was a really generous girl, and allowed no further bitterness to</p>

<p>mar their adieux.</p>

<p>"I forgive 'ee, sir!" she said.</p>

<p>"Now, Izz," he said, while she stood beside him there, forcing</p>

<p>himself to the mentor's part he was far from feeling; "I want you to</p>

<p>tell Marian when you see her that she is to be a good woman, and not</p>

<p>to give way to folly.  Promise that, and tell Retty that there are</p>

<p>more worthy men than I in the world, that for my sake she is to act</p>

<p>wisely and well--remember the words--wisely and well--for my sake.</p>

<p>I send this message to them as a dying man to the dying; for I shall</p>

<p>never see them again.  And you, Izzy, you have saved me by your</p>

<p>honest words about my wife from an incredible impulse towards folly</p>

<p>and treachery.  Women may be bad, but they are not so bad as men in</p>

<p>these things!  On that one account I can never forget you.  Be always</p>

<p>the good and sincere girl you have hitherto been; and think of me as</p>

<p>a worthless lover, but a faithful friend.  Promise."</p>

<p>She gave the promise.</p>

<p>"Heaven bless and keep you, sir.  Goodbye!"</p>

<p>He drove on; but no sooner had Izz turned into the lane, and Clare</p>

<p>was out of sight, than she flung herself down on the bank in a fit of</p>

<p>racking anguish; and it was with a strained unnatural face that she</p>

<p>entered her mother's cottage late that night.  Nobody ever was told</p>

<p>how Izz spent the dark hours that intervened between Angel Clare's</p>

<p>parting from her and her arrival home.</p>

<p>Clare, too, after bidding the girl farewell, was wrought to aching</p>

<p>thoughts and quivering lips.  But his sorrow was not for Izz.  That</p>

<p>evening he was within a feather-weight's turn of abandoning his road</p>

<p>to the nearest station, and driving across that elevated dorsal line</p>

<p>of South Wessex which divided him from his Tess's home.  It was</p>

<p>neither a contempt for her nature, nor the probable state of her</p>

<p>heart, which deterred him.</p>

<p>No; it was a sense that, despite her love, as corroborated by Izz's</p>

<p>admission, the facts had not changed.  If he was right at first,</p>

<p>he was right now.  And the momentum of the course on which he</p>

<p>had embarked tended to keep him going in it, unless diverted by</p>

<p>a stronger, more sustained force than had played upon him this</p>

<p>afternoon.  He could soon come back to her.  He took the train that</p>

<p>night for London, and five days after shook hands in farewell of his</p>

<p>brothers at the port of embarkation.</p>

<p>XLI</p>

<p>From the foregoing events of the winter-time let us press on to</p>

<p>an October day, more than eight months subsequent to the parting</p>

<p>of Clare and Tess.  We discover the latter in changed conditions;</p>

<p>instead of a bride with boxes and trunks which others bore, we see</p>

<p>her a lonely woman with a basket and a bundle in her own porterage,</p>

<p>as at an earlier time when she was no bride; instead of the ample</p>

<p>means that were projected by her husband for her comfort through</p>

<p>this probationary period, she can produce only a flattened purse.</p>

<p>After again leaving Marlott, her home, she had got through the</p>

<p>spring and summer without any great stress upon her physical powers,</p>

<p>the time being mainly spent in rendering light irregular service</p>

<p>at dairy-work near Port-Bredy to the west of the Blackmoor Valley,</p>

<p>equally remote from her native place and from Talbothays.  She</p>

<p>preferred this to living on his allowance.  Mentally she remained in</p>

<p>utter stagnation, a condition which the mechanical occupation rather</p>

<p>fostered than checked.  Her consciousness was at that other dairy,</p>

<p>at that other season, in the presence of the tender lover who had</p>

<p>confronted her there--he who, the moment she had grasped him to keep</p>

<p>for her own, had disappeared like a shape in a vision.</p>

<p>The dairy-work lasted only till the milk began to lessen, for she</p>

<p>had not met with a second regular engagement as at Talbothays, but</p>

<p>had done duty as a supernumerary only.  However, as harvest was now</p>

<p>beginning, she had simply to remove from the pasture to the stubble</p>

<p>to find plenty of further occupation, and this continued till harvest</p>

<p>was done.</p>

<p>Of the five-and-twenty pounds which had remained to her of Clare's</p>

<p>allowance, after deducting the other half of the fifty as a</p>

<p>contribution to her parents for the trouble and expense to which</p>

<p>she had put them, she had as yet spent but little.  But there now</p>

<p>followed an unfortunate interval of wet weather, during which she was</p>

<p>obliged to fall back upon her sovereigns.</p>

<p>She could not bear to let them go.  Angel had put them into her hand,</p>

<p>had obtained them bright and new from his bank for her; his touch had</p>

<p>consecrated them to souvenirs of himself--they appeared to have had</p>

<p>as yet no other history than such as was created by his and her own</p>

<p>experiences--and to disperse them was like giving away relics.  But</p>

<p>she had to do it, and one by one they left her hands.</p>

<p>She had been compelled to send her mother her address from time to</p>

<p>time, but she concealed her circumstances.  When her money had almost</p>

<p>gone a letter from her mother reached her.  Joan stated that they</p>

<p>were in dreadful difficulty; the autumn rains had gone through the</p>

<p>thatch of the house, which required entire renewal; but this could</p>

<p>not be done because the previous thatching had never been paid for.</p>

<p>New rafters and a new ceiling upstairs also were required, which,</p>

<p>with the previous bill, would amount to a sum of twenty pounds.  As</p>

<p>her husband was a man of means, and had doubtless returned by this</p>

<p>time, could she not send them the money?</p>

<p>Tess had thirty pounds coming to her almost immediately from Angel's</p>

<p>bankers, and, the case being so deplorable, as soon as the sum was</p>

<p>received she sent the twenty as requested.  Part of the remainder</p>

<p>she was obliged to expend in winter clothing, leaving only a nominal</p>

<p>sum for the whole inclement season at hand.  When the last pound</p>

<p>had gone, a remark of Angel's that whenever she required further</p>

<p>resources she was to apply to his father, remained to be considered.</p>

<p>But the more Tess thought of the step, the more reluctant was she to</p>

<p>take it.  The same delicacy, pride, false shame, whatever it may be</p>

<p>called, on Clare's account, which had led her to hide from her own</p>

<p>parents the prolongation of the estrangement, hindered her owning to</p>

<p>his that she was in want after the fair allowance he had left her.</p>

<p>They probably despised her already; how much more they would despise</p>

<p>her in the character of a mendicant!  The consequence was that by no</p>

<p>effort could the parson's daughter-in-law bring herself to let him</p>

<p>know her state.</p>

<p>Her reluctance to communicate with her husband's parents might,</p>

<p>she thought, lessen with the lapse of time; but with her own the</p>

<p>reverse obtained.  On her leaving their house after the short visit</p>

<p>subsequent to her marriage they were under the impression that she</p>

<p>was ultimately going to join her husband; and from that time to the</p>

<p>present she had done nothing to disturb their belief that she was</p>

<p>awaiting his return in comfort, hoping against hope that his journey</p>

<p>to Brazil would result in a short stay only, after which he would</p>

<p>come to fetch her, or that he would write for her to join him; in any</p>

<p>case that they would soon present a united front to their families</p>

<p>and the world.  This hope she still fostered.  To let her parents</p>

<p>know that she was a deserted wife, dependent, now that she had</p>

<p>relieved their necessities, on her own hands for a living, after the</p>

<p>_йclat_ of a marriage which was to nullify the collapse of the first</p>

<p>attempt, would be too much indeed.</p>

<p>The set of brilliants returned to her mind.  Where Clare had</p>

<p>deposited them she did not know, and it mattered little, if it were</p>

<p>true that she could only use and not sell them.  Even were they</p>

<p>absolutely hers it would be passing mean to enrich herself by a legal</p>

<p>title to them which was not essentially hers at all.</p>

<p>Meanwhile her husband's days had been by no means free from trial.</p>

<p>At this moment he was lying ill of fever in the clay lands near</p>

<p>Curitiba in Brazil, having been drenched with thunder-storms and</p>

<p>persecuted by other hardships, in common with all the English farmers</p>

<p>and farm-labourers who, just at this time, were deluded into going</p>

<p>thither by the promises of the Brazilian Government, and by the</p>

<p>baseless assumption that those frames which, ploughing and sowing on</p>

<p>English uplands, had resisted all the weathers to whose moods they</p>

<p>had been born, could resist equally well all the weathers by which</p>

<p>they were surprised on Brazilian plains.</p>

<p>To return.  Thus it happened that when the last of Tess's sovereigns</p>

<p>had been spent she was unprovided with others to take their place,</p>

<p>while on account of the season she found it increasingly difficult</p>

<p>to get employment.  Not being aware of the rarity of intelligence,</p>

<p>energy, health, and willingness in any sphere of life, she refrained</p>

<p>from seeking an indoor occupation; fearing towns, large houses,</p>

<p>people of means and social sophistication, and of manners other</p>

<p>than rural.  From that direction of gentility Black Care had come.</p>

<p>Society might be better than she supposed from her slight experience</p>

<p>of it.  But she had no proof of this, and her instinct in the</p>

<p>circumstances was to avoid its purlieus.</p>

<p>The small dairies to the west, beyond Port-Bredy, in which she</p>

<p>had served as supernumerary milkmaid during the spring and summer</p>

<p>required no further aid.  Room would probably have been made for her</p>

<p>at Talbothays, if only out of sheer compassion; but comfortable as</p>

<p>her life had been there, she could not go back.  The anti-climax</p>

<p>would be too intolerable; and her return might bring reproach upon</p>

<p>her idolized husband.  She could not have borne their pity, and their</p>

<p>whispered remarks to one another upon her strange situation; though</p>

<p>she would almost have faced a knowledge of her circumstances by every</p>

<p>individual there, so long as her story had remained isolated in the</p>

<p>mind of each.  It was the interchange of ideas about her that made</p>

<p>her sensitiveness wince.  Tess could not account for this</p>

<p>distinction; she simply knew that she felt it.</p>

<p>She was now on her way to an upland farm in the centre of the county,</p>

<p>to which she had been recommended by a wandering letter which had</p>

<p>reached her from Marian.  Marian had somehow heard that Tess was</p>

<p>separated from her husband--probably through Izz Huett--and the</p>

<p>good-natured and now tippling girl, deeming Tess in trouble, had</p>

<p>hastened to notify to her former friend that she herself had gone to</p>

<p>this upland spot after leaving the dairy, and would like to see her</p>

<p>there, where there was room for other hands, if it was really true</p>

<p>that she worked again as of old.</p>

<p>With the shortening of the days all hope of obtaining her husband's</p>

<p>forgiveness began to leave her; and there was something of the</p>

<p>habitude of the wild animal in the unreflecting instinct with which</p>

<p>she rambled on--disconnecting herself by littles from her eventful</p>

<p>past at every step, obliterating her identity, giving no thought to</p>

<p>accidents or contingencies which might make a quick discovery of her</p>

<p>whereabouts by others of importance to her own happiness, if not to</p>

<p>theirs.</p>

<p>Among the difficulties of her lonely position not the least was</p>

<p>the attention she excited by her appearance, a certain bearing of</p>

<p>distinction, which she had caught from Clare, being superadded to her</p>

<p>natural attractiveness.  Whilst the clothes lasted which had been</p>

<p>prepared for her marriage, these casual glances of interest caused</p>

<p>her no inconvenience, but as soon as she was compelled to don the</p>

<p>wrapper of a fieldwoman, rude words were addressed to her more than</p>

<p>once; but nothing occurred to cause her bodily fear till a particular</p>

<p>November afternoon.</p>

<p>She had preferred the country west of the River Brit to the upland</p>

<p>farm for which she was now bound, because, for one thing, it was</p>

<p>nearer to the home of her husband's father; and to hover about that</p>

<p>region unrecognized, with the notion that she might decide to call at</p>

<p>the Vicarage some day, gave her pleasure.  But having once decided to</p>

<p>try the higher and drier levels, she pressed back eastward, marching</p>

<p>afoot towards the village of Chalk-Newton, where she meant to pass</p>

<p>the night.</p>

<p>The lane was long and unvaried, and, owing to the rapid shortening of</p>

<p>the days, dusk came upon her before she was aware.  She had reached</p>

<p>the top of a hill down which the lane stretched its serpentine length</p>

<p>in glimpses, when she heard footsteps behind her back, and in a few</p>

<p>moments she was overtaken by a man.  He stepped up alongside Tess and</p>

<p>said--</p>

<p>"Good night, my pretty maid": to which she civilly replied.</p>

<p>The light still remaining in the sky lit up her face, though the</p>

<p>landscape was nearly dark.  The man turned and stared hard at her.</p>

<p>"Why, surely, it is the young wench who was at Trantridge awhile--</p>

<p>young Squire d'Urberville's friend?  I was there at that time, though</p>

<p>I don't live there now."</p>

<p>She recognized in him the well-to-do boor whom Angel had knocked down</p>

<p>at the inn for addressing her coarsely.  A spasm of anguish shot</p>

<p>through her, and she returned him no answer.</p>

<p>"Be honest enough to own it, and that what I said in the town was</p>

<p>true, though your fancy-man was so up about it--hey, my sly one?  You</p>

<p>ought to beg my pardon for that blow of his, considering."</p>

<p>Still no answer came from Tess.  There seemed only one escape for her</p>

<p>hunted soul.  She suddenly took to her heels with the speed of the</p>

<p>wind, and, without looking behind her, ran along the road till she</p>

<p>came to a gate which opened directly into a plantation.  Into this</p>

<p>she plunged, and did not pause till she was deep enough in its shade</p>

<p>to be safe against any possibility of discovery.</p>

<p>Under foot the leaves were dry, and the foliage of some holly bushes</p>

<p>which grew among the deciduous trees was dense enough to keep off</p>

<p>draughts.  She scraped together the dead leaves till she had formed</p>

<p>them into a large heap, making a sort of nest in the middle.  Into</p>

<p>this Tess crept.</p>

<p>Such sleep as she got was naturally fitful; she fancied she heard</p>

<p>strange noises, but persuaded herself that they were caused by the</p>

<p>breeze.  She thought of her husband in some vague warm clime on the</p>

<p>other side of the globe, while she was here in the cold.  Was there</p>

<p>another such a wretched being as she in the world?  Tess asked</p>

<p>herself; and, thinking of her wasted life, said, "All is vanity."</p>

<p>She repeated the words mechanically, till she reflected that this</p>

<p>was a most inadequate thought for modern days.  Solomon had thought</p>

<p>as far as that more than two thousand years ago; she herself,</p>

<p>though not in the van of thinkers, had got much further.  If all</p>

<p>were only vanity, who would mind it?  All was, alas, worse than</p>

<p>vanity--injustice, punishment, exaction, death.  The wife of Angel</p>

<p>Clare put her hand to her brow, and felt its curve, and the edges of</p>

<p>her eye-sockets perceptible under the soft skin, and thought as she</p>

<p>did so that a time would come when that bone would be bare.  "I wish</p>

<p>it were now," she said.</p>

<p>In the midst of these whimsical fancies she heard a new strange sound</p>

<p>among the leaves.  It might be the wind; yet there was scarcely any</p>

<p>wind.  Sometimes it was a palpitation, sometimes a flutter; sometimes</p>

<p>it was a sort of gasp or gurgle.  Soon she was certain that the</p>

<p>noises came from wild creatures of some kind, the more so when,</p>

<p>originating in the boughs overhead, they were followed by the fall</p>

<p>of a heavy body upon the ground.  Had she been ensconced here under</p>

<p>other and more pleasant conditions she would have become alarmed;</p>

<p>but, outside humanity, she had at present no fear.</p>

<p>Day at length broke in the sky.  When it had been day aloft for some</p>

<p>little while it became day in the wood.</p>

<p>Directly the assuring and prosaic light of the world's active hours</p>

<p>had grown strong, she crept from under her hillock of leaves, and</p>

<p>looked around boldly.  Then she perceived what had been going on to</p>

<p>disturb her.  The plantation wherein she had taken shelter ran down</p>

<p>at this spot into a peak, which ended it hitherward, outside the</p>

<p>hedge being arable ground.  Under the trees several pheasants lay</p>

<p>about, their rich plumage dabbled with blood; some were dead, some</p>

<p>feebly twitching a wing, some staring up at the sky, some pulsating</p>

<p>quickly, some contorted, some stretched out--all of them writhing in</p>

<p>agony, except the fortunate ones whose tortures had ended during the</p>

<p>night by the inability of nature to bear more.</p>

<p>Tess guessed at once the meaning of this.  The birds had been driven</p>

<p>down into this corner the day before by some shooting-party; and</p>

<p>while those that had dropped dead under the shot, or had died before</p>

<p>nightfall, had been searched for and carried off, many badly wounded</p>

<p>birds had escaped and hidden themselves away, or risen among the</p>

<p>thick boughs, where they had maintained their position till they grew</p>

<p>weaker with loss of blood in the night-time, when they had fallen one</p>

<p>by one as she had heard them.</p>

<p>She had occasionally caught glimpses of these men in girlhood,</p>

<p>looking over hedges, or peeping through bushes, and pointing their</p>

<p>guns, strangely accoutred, a bloodthirsty light in their eyes.  She</p>

<p>had been told that, rough and brutal as they seemed just then, they</p>

<p>were not like this all the year round, but were, in fact, quite civil</p>

<p>persons save during certain weeks of autumn and winter, when, like</p>

<p>the inhabitants of the Malay Peninsula, they ran amuck, and made</p>

<p>it their purpose to destroy life--in this case harmless feathered</p>

<p>creatures, brought into being by artificial means solely to gratify</p>

<p>these propensities--at once so unmannerly and so unchivalrous towards</p>

<p>their weaker fellows in Nature's teeming family.</p>

<p>With the impulse of a soul who could feel for kindred sufferers as</p>

<p>much as for herself, Tess's first thought was to put the still living</p>

<p>birds out of their torture, and to this end with her own hands she</p>

<p>broke the necks of as many as she could find, leaving them to lie</p>

<p>where she had found them till the game-keepers should come--as they</p>

<p>probably would come--to look for them a second time.</p>

<p>"Poor darlings--to suppose myself the most miserable being on earth</p>

<p>in the sight o' such misery as yours!" she exclaimed, her tears</p>

<p>running down as she killed the birds tenderly.  "And not a twinge of</p>

<p>bodily pain about me!  I be not mangled, and I be not bleeding, and</p>

<p>I have two hands to feed and clothe me."  She was ashamed of herself</p>

<p>for her gloom of the night, based on nothing more tangible than a</p>

<p>sense of condemnation under an arbitrary law of society which had no</p>

<p>foundation in Nature.</p>

<p>XLII</p>

<p>It was now broad day, and she started again, emerging cautiously upon</p>

<p>the highway.  But there was no need for caution; not a soul was at</p>

<p>hand, and Tess went onward with fortitude, her recollection of the</p>

<p>birds' silent endurance of their night of agony impressing upon her</p>

<p>the relativity of sorrows and the tolerable nature of her own, if she</p>

<p>could once rise high enough to despise opinion.  But that she could</p>

<p>not do so long as it was held by Clare.</p>

<p>She reached Chalk-Newton, and breakfasted at an inn, where several</p>

<p>young men were troublesomely complimentary to her good looks.</p>

<p>Somehow she felt hopeful, for was it not possible that her husband</p>

<p>also might say these same things to her even yet?  She was bound to</p>

<p>take care of herself on the chance of it, and keep off these casual</p>

<p>lovers.  To this end Tess resolved to run no further risks from her</p>

<p>appearance.  As soon as she got out of the village she entered a</p>

<p>thicket and took from her basket one of the oldest field-gowns, which</p>

<p>she had never put on even at the dairy--never since she had worked</p>

<p>among the stubble at Marlott.  She also, by a felicitous thought,</p>

<p>took a handkerchief from her bundle and tied it round her face under</p>

<p>her bonnet, covering her chin and half her cheeks and temples, as if</p>

<p>she were suffering from toothache. Then with her little scissors,</p>

<p>by the aid of a pocket looking-glass, she mercilessly nipped her</p>

<p>eyebrows off, and thus insured against aggressive admiration, she</p>

<p>went on her uneven way.</p>

<p>"What a mommet of a maid!" said the next man who met her to a</p>

<p>companion.</p>

<p>Tears came into her eyes for very pity of herself as she heard him.</p>

<p>"But I don't care!" she said.  "O no--I don't care!  I'll always be</p>

<p>ugly now, because Angel is not here, and I have nobody to take care</p>

<p>of me.  My husband that was is gone away, and never will love me any</p>

<p>more; but I love him just the same, and hate all other men, and like</p>

<p>to make 'em think scornfully of me!"</p>

<p>Thus Tess walks on; a figure which is part of the landscape; a</p>

<p>fieldwoman pure and simple, in winter guise; a gray serge cape, a</p>

<p>red woollen cravat, a stuff skirt covered by a whitey-brown rough</p>

<p>wrapper, and buff-leather gloves.  Every thread of that old attire</p>

<p>has become faded and thin under the stroke of raindrops, the burn of</p>

<p>sunbeams, and the stress of winds.  There is no sign of young passion</p>

<p>in her now--</p>

<p>     The maiden's mouth is cold</p>

<p>     . . .</p>

<p>     Fold over simple fold</p>

<p>     Binding her head.</p>

<p>Inside this exterior, over which the eye might have roved as over a</p>

<p>thing scarcely percipient, almost inorganic, there was the record of</p>

<p>a pulsing life which had learnt too well, for its years, of the dust</p>

<p>and ashes of things, of the cruelty of lust and the fragility of</p>

<p>love.</p>

<p>Next day the weather was bad, but she trudged on, the honesty,</p>

<p>directness, and impartiality of elemental enmity disconcerting her</p>

<p>but little.  Her object being a winter's occupation and a winter's</p>

<p>home, there was no time to lose.  Her experience of short hirings</p>

<p>had been such that she was determined to accept no more.</p>

<p>Thus she went forward from farm to farm in the direction of the place</p>

<p>whence Marian had written to her, which she determined to make use of</p>

<p>as a last shift only, its rumoured stringencies being the reverse of</p>

<p>tempting.  First she inquired for the lighter kinds of employment,</p>

<p>and, as acceptance in any variety of these grew hopeless, applied</p>

<p>next for the less light, till, beginning with the dairy and poultry</p>

<p>tendance that she liked best, she ended with the heavy and course</p>

<p>pursuits which she liked least--work on arable land: work of such</p>

<p>roughness, indeed, as she would never have deliberately voluteered</p>

<p>for.</p>

<p>Towards the second evening she reached the irregular chalk table-land</p>

<p>or plateau, bosomed with semi-globular tumuli--as if Cybele the</p>

<p>Many-breasted were supinely extended there--which stretched between</p>

<p>the valley of her birth and the valley of her love.</p>

<p>Here the air was dry and cold, and the long cart-roads were blown</p>

<p>white and dusty within a few hours after rain.  There were few trees,</p>

<p>or none, those that would have grown in the hedges being mercilessly</p>

<p>plashed down with the quickset by the tenant-farmers, the natural</p>

<p>enemies of tree, bush, and brake.  In the middle distance ahead of</p>

<p>her she could see the summits of Bulbarrow and of Nettlecombe Tout,</p>

<p>and they seemed friendly.  They had a low and unassuming aspect from</p>

<p>this upland, though as approached on the other side from Blackmoor</p>

<p>in her childhood they were as lofty bastions against the sky.</p>

<p>Southerly, at many miles' distance, and over the hills and ridges</p>

<p>coastward, she could discern a surface like polished steel: it was</p>

<p>the English Channel at a point far out towards France.</p>

<p>Before her, in a slight depression, were the remains of a village.</p>

<p>She had, in fact, reached Flintcomb-Ash, the place of Marian's</p>

<p>sojourn.  There seemed to be no help for it; hither she was doomed to</p>

<p>come.  The stubborn soil around her showed plainly enough that the</p>

<p>kind of labour in demand here was of the roughest kind; but it was</p>

<p>time to rest from searching, and she resolved to stay, particularly</p>

<p>as it began to rain.  At the entrance to the village was a cottage</p>

<p>whose gable jutted into the road, and before applying for a lodging</p>

<p>she stood under its shelter, and watched the evening close in.</p>

<p>"Who would think I was Mrs Angel Clare!" she said.</p>

<p>The wall felt warm to her back and shoulders, and she found that</p>

<p>immediately within the gable was the cottage fireplace, the heat of</p>

<p>which came through the bricks.  She warmed her hands upon them, and</p>

<p>also put her cheek--red and moist with the drizzle--against their</p>

<p>comforting surface.  The wall seemed to be the only friend she had.</p>

<p>She had so little wish to leave it that she could have stayed there</p>

<p>all night.</p>

<p>Tess could hear the occupants of the cottage--gathered together after</p>

<p>their day's labour--talking to each other within, and the rattle of</p>

<p>their supper-plates was also audible.  But in the village-street she</p>

<p>had seen no soul as yet.  The solitude was at last broken by the</p>

<p>approach of one feminine figure, who, though the evening was cold,</p>

<p>wore the print gown and the tilt-bonnet of summer time.  Tess</p>

<p>instinctively thought it might be Marian, and when she came near</p>

<p>enough to be distinguishable in the gloom, surely enough it was</p>

<p>she.  Marian was even stouter and redder in the face than formerly,</p>

<p>and decidedly shabbier in attire.  At any previous period of her</p>

<p>existence Tess would hardly have cared to renew the acquaintance in</p>

<p>such conditions; but her loneliness was excessive, and she responded</p>

<p>readily to Marian's greeting.</p>

<p>Marian was quite respectful in her inquiries, but seemed much moved</p>

<p>by the fact that Tess should still continue in no better condition</p>

<p>than at first; though she had dimly heard of the separation.</p>

<p>"Tess--Mrs Clare--the dear wife of dear he!  And is it really so bad</p>

<p>as this, my child?  Why is your cwomely face tied up in such a way?</p>

<p>Anybody been beating 'ee?  Not HE?"</p>

<p>"No, no, no!  I merely did it not to be clipsed or colled, Marian."</p>

<p>She pulled off in disgust a bandage which could suggest such wild</p>

<p>thoughts.</p>

<p>"And you've got no collar on" (Tess had been accustomed to wear a</p>

<p>little white collar at the dairy).</p>

<p>"I know it, Marian."</p>

<p>"You've lost it travelling."</p>

<p>"I've not lost it.  The truth is, I don't care anything about my</p>

<p>looks; and so I didn't put it on."</p>

<p>"And you don't wear your wedding-ring?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I do; but not in public.  I wear it round my neck on a ribbon.</p>

<p>I don't wish people to think who I am by marriage, or that I am</p>

<p>married at all; it would be so awkward while I lead my present life."</p>

<p>Marian paused.</p>

<p>"But you BE a gentleman's wife; and it seems hardly fair that you</p>

<p>should live like this!"</p>

<p>"O yes it is, quite fair; though I am very unhappy."</p>

<p>"Well, well.  HE married you--and you can be unhappy!"</p>

<p>"Wives are unhappy sometimes; from no fault of their husbands--from</p>

<p>their own."</p>

<p>"You've no faults, deary; that I'm sure of.  And he's none.  So it</p>

<p>must be something outside ye both."</p>

<p>"Marian, dear Marian, will you do me a good turn without asking</p>

<p>questions?  My husband has gone abroad, and somehow I have overrun my</p>

<p>allowance, so that I have to fall back upon my old work for a time.</p>

<p>Do not call me Mrs Clare, but Tess, as before.  Do they want a hand</p>

<p>here?"</p>

<p>"O yes; they'll take one always, because few care to come.  'Tis a</p>

<p>starve-acre place.  Corn and swedes are all they grow.  Though I be</p>

<p>here myself, I feel 'tis a pity for such as you to come."</p>

<p>"But you used to be as good a dairywoman as I."</p>

<p>"Yes; but I've got out o' that since I took to drink.  Lord, that's</p>

<p>the only comfort I've got now!  If you engage, you'll be set</p>

<p>swede-hacking.  That's what I be doing; but you won't like it."</p>

<p>"O--anything!  Will you speak for me?"</p>

<p>"You will do better by speaking for yourself."</p>

<p>"Very well.  Now, Marian, remember--nothing about HIM if I get the</p>

<p>place.  I don't wish to bring his name down to the dirt."</p>

<p>Marian, who was really a trustworthy girl though of coarser grain</p>

<p>than Tess, promised anything she asked.</p>

<p>"This is pay-night," she said, "and if you were to come with me you</p>

<p>would know at once.  I be real sorry that you are not happy; but 'tis</p>

<p>because he's away, I know.  You couldn't be unhappy if he were here,</p>

<p>even if he gie'd ye no money--even if he used you like a drudge."</p>

<p>"That's true; I could not!"</p>

<p>They walked on together and soon reached the farmhouse, which was</p>

<p>almost sublime in its dreariness. There was not a tree within sight;</p>

<p>there was not, at this season, a green pasture--nothing but fallow</p>

<p>and turnips everywhere, in large fields divided by hedges plashed to</p>

<p>unrelieved levels.</p>

<p>Tess waited outside the door of the farmhouse till the group of</p>

<p>workfolk had received their wages, and then Marian introduced her.</p>

<p>The farmer himself, it appeared, was not at home, but his wife, who</p>

<p>represented him this evening, made no objection to hiring Tess, on</p>

<p>her agreeing to remain till Old Lady-Day.  Female field-labour was</p>

<p>seldom offered now, and its cheapness made it profitable for tasks</p>

<p>which women could perform as readily as men.</p>

<p>Having signed the agreement, there was nothing more for Tess to do</p>

<p>at present than to get a lodging, and she found one in the house at</p>

<p>whose gable-wall she had warmed herself.  It was a poor subsistence</p>

<p>that she had ensured, but it would afford a shelter for the winter</p>

<p>at any rate.</p>

<p>That night she wrote to inform her parents of her new address, in</p>

<p>case a letter should arrive at Marlott from her husband.  But she</p>

<p>did not tell them of the sorriness of her situation: it might have</p>

<p>brought reproach upon him.</p>

<p>XLIII</p>

<p>There was no exaggeration in Marian's definition of Flintcomb-Ash</p>

<p>farm as a starve-acre place.  The single fat thing on the soil was</p>

<p>Marian herself; and she was an importation.  Of the three classes of</p>

<p>village, the village cared for by its lord, the village cared for by</p>

<p>itself, and the village uncared for either by itself or by its lord</p>

<p>(in other words, the village of a resident squires's tenantry, the</p>

<p>village of free- or copy-holders, and the absentee-owner's village,</p>

<p>farmed with the land) this place, Flintcomb-Ash, was the third.</p>

<p>But Tess set to work.  Patience, that blending of moral courage with</p>

<p>physical timidity, was now no longer a minor feature in Mrs Angel</p>

<p>Clare; and it sustained her.</p>

<p>The swede-field in which she and her companion were set hacking was</p>

<p>a stretch of a hundred odd acres in one patch, on the highest ground</p>

<p>of the farm, rising above stony lanchets or lynchets--the outcrop of</p>

<p>siliceous veins in the chalk formation, composed of myriads of loose</p>

<p>white flints in bulbous, cusped, and phallic shapes.  The upper half</p>

<p>of each turnip had been eaten off by the live-stock, and it was the</p>

<p>business of the two women to grub up the lower or earthy half of the</p>

<p>root with a hooked fork called a hacker, that it might be eaten also.</p>

<p>Every leaf of the vegetable having already been consumed, the whole</p>

<p>field was in colour a desolate drab; it was a complexion without</p>

<p>features, as if a face, from chin to brow, should be only an expanse</p>

<p>of skin.  The sky wore, in another colour, the same likeness; a white</p>

<p>vacuity of countenance with the lineaments gone.  So these two upper</p>

<p>and nether visages confronted each other all day long, the white face</p>

<p>looking down on the brown face, and the brown face looking up at the</p>

<p>white face, without anything standing between them but the two girls</p>

<p>crawling over the surface of the former like flies.</p>

<p>Nobody came near them, and their movements showed a mechanical</p>

<p>regularity; their forms standing enshrouded in Hessian "wroppers"--</p>

<p>sleeved brown pinafores, tied behind to the bottom, to keep their</p>

<p>gowns from blowing about--scant skirts revealing boots that reached</p>

<p>high up the ankles, and yellow sheepskin gloves with gauntlets.  The</p>

<p>pensive character which the curtained hood lent to their bent heads</p>

<p>would have reminded the observer of some early Italian conception of</p>

<p>the two Marys.</p>

<p>They worked on hour after hour, unconscious of the forlorn aspect</p>

<p>they bore in the landscape, not thinking of the justice or injustice</p>

<p>of their lot.  Even in such a position as theirs it was possible</p>

<p>to exist in a dream.  In the afternoon the rain came on again, and</p>

<p>Marian said that they need not work any more.  But if they did not</p>

<p>work they would not be paid; so they worked on.  It was so high a</p>

<p>situation, this field, that the rain had no occasion to fall, but</p>

<p>raced along horizontally upon the yelling wind, sticking into them</p>

<p>like glass splinters till they were wet through.  Tess had not</p>

<p>known till now what was really meant by that.  There are degrees of</p>

<p>dampness, and a very little is called being wet through in common</p>

<p>talk.  But to stand working slowly in a field, and feel the creep of</p>

<p>rain-water, first in legs and shoulders, then on hips and head, then</p>

<p>at back, front, and sides, and yet to work on till the leaden light</p>

<p>diminishes and marks that the sun is down, demands a distinct modicum</p>

<p>of stoicism, even of valour.</p>

<p>Yet they did not feel the wetness so much as might be supposed.  They</p>

<p>were both young, and they were talking of the time when they lived</p>

<p>and loved together at Talbothays Dairy, that happy green tract of</p>

<p>land where summer had been liberal in her gifts; in substance to</p>

<p>all, emotionally to these.  Tess would fain not have conversed with</p>

<p>Marian of the man who was legally, if not actually, her husband;</p>

<p>but the irresistible fascination of the subject betrayed her into</p>

<p>reciprocating Marian's remarks.  And thus, as has been said, though</p>

<p>the damp curtains of their bonnets flapped smartly into their faces,</p>

<p>and their wrappers clung about them to wearisomeness, they lived all</p>

<p>this afternoon in memories of green, sunny, romantic Talbothays.</p>

<p>"You can see a gleam of a hill within a few miles o' Froom Valley</p>

<p>from here when 'tis fine," said Marian.</p>

<p>"Ah!  Can you?" said Tess, awake to the new value of this locality.</p>

<p>So the two forces were at work here as everywhere, the inherent will</p>

<p>to enjoy, and the circumstantial will against enjoyment.  Marian's</p>

<p>will had a method of assisting itself by taking from her pocket as</p>

<p>the afternoon wore on a pint bottle corked with white rag, from which</p>

<p>she invited Tess to drink.  Tess's unassisted power of dreaming,</p>

<p>however, being enough for her sublimation at present, she declined</p>

<p>except the merest sip, and then Marian took a pull from the spirits.</p>

<p>"I've got used to it," she said, "and can't leave it off now.  'Tis</p>

<p>my only comfort--You see I lost him: you didn't; and you can do</p>

<p>without it perhaps."</p>

<p>Tess thought her loss as great as Marian's, but upheld by the dignity</p>

<p>of being Angel's wife, in the letter at least, she accepted Marian's</p>

<p>differentiation.</p>

<p>Amid this scene Tess slaved in the morning frosts and in</p>

<p>the afternoon rains.  When it was not swede-grubbing it was</p>

<p>swede-trimming, in which process they sliced off the earth and the</p>

<p>fibres with a bill-hook before storing the roots for future use.  At</p>

<p>this occupation they could shelter themselves by a thatched hurdle if</p>

<p>it rained; but if it was frosty even their thick leather gloves could</p>

<p>not prevent the frozen masses they handled from biting their fingers.</p>

<p>Still Tess hoped.  She had a conviction that sooner or later the</p>

<p>magnanimity which she persisted in reckoning as a chief ingredient</p>

<p>of Clare's character would lead him to rejoin her.</p>

<p>Marian, primed to a humorous mood, would discover the queer-shaped</p>

<p>flints aforesaid, and shriek with laughter, Tess remaining severely</p>

<p>obtuse.  They often looked across the country to where the Var or</p>

<p>Froom was know to stretch, even though they might not be able to see</p>

<p>it; and, fixing their eyes on the cloaking gray mist, imagined the</p>

<p>old times they had spent out there.</p>

<p>"Ah," said Marian, "how I should like another or two of our old set</p>

<p>to come here!  Then we could bring up Talbothays every day here</p>

<p>afield, and talk of he, and of what nice times we had there, and o'</p>

<p>the old things we used to know, and make it all come back a'most, in</p>

<p>seeming!"  Marian's eyes softened, and her voice grew vague as the</p>

<p>visions returned.  "I'll write to Izz Huett," she said.  "She's</p>

<p>biding at home doing nothing now, I know, and I'll tell her we be</p>

<p>here, and ask her to come; and perhaps Retty is well enough now."</p>

<p>Tess had nothing to say against the proposal, and the next she heard</p>

<p>of this plan for importing old Talbothays' joys was two or three days</p>

<p>later, when Marian informed her that Izz had replied to her inquiry,</p>

<p>and had promised to come if she could.</p>

<p>There had not been such a winter for years.  It came on in stealthy</p>

<p>and measured glides, like the moves of a chess-player.  One morning</p>

<p>the few lonely trees and the thorns of the hedgerows appeared as if</p>

<p>they had put off a vegetable for an animal integument.  Every twig</p>

<p>was covered with a white nap as of fur grown from the rind during the</p>

<p>night, giving it four times its usual stoutness; the whole bush or</p>

<p>tree forming a staring sketch in white lines on the mournful gray</p>

<p>of the sky and horizon.  Cobwebs revealed their presence on sheds</p>

<p>and walls where none had ever been observed till brought out into</p>

<p>visibility by the crystallizing atmosphere, hanging like loops of</p>

<p>white worsted from salient points of the out-houses, posts, and</p>

<p>gates.</p>

<p>After this season of congealed dampness came a spell of dry frost,</p>

<p>when strange birds from behind the North Pole began to arrive</p>

<p>silently on the upland of Flintcomb-Ash; gaunt spectral creatures</p>

<p>with tragical eyes--eyes which had witnessed scenes of cataclysmal</p>

<p>horror in inaccessible polar regions of a magnitude such as no human</p>

<p>being had ever conceived, in curdling temperatures that no man could</p>

<p>endure; which had beheld the crash of icebergs and the slide of</p>

<p>snow-hills by the shooting light of the Aurora; been half blinded</p>

<p>by the whirl of colossal storms and terraqueous distortions; and</p>

<p>retained the expression of feature that such scenes had engendered.</p>

<p>These nameless birds came quite near to Tess and Marian, but of</p>

<p>all they had seen which humanity would never see, they brought no</p>

<p>account.  The traveller's ambition to tell was not theirs, and, with</p>

<p>dumb impassivity, they dismissed experiences which they did not</p>

<p>value for the immediate incidents of this homely upland--the trivial</p>

<p>movements of the two girls in disturbing the clods with their hackers</p>

<p>so as to uncover something or other that these visitants relished as</p>

<p>food.</p>

<p>Then one day a peculiar quality invaded the air of this open country.</p>

<p>There came a moisture which was not of rain, and a cold which was not</p>

<p>of frost.  It chilled the eyeballs of the twain, made their brows</p>

<p>ache, penetrated to their skeletons, affecting the surface of the</p>

<p>body less than its core.  They knew that it meant snow, and in the</p>

<p>night the snow came.  Tess, who continued to live at the cottage with</p>

<p>the warm gable that cheered any lonely pedestrian who paused beside</p>

<p>it, awoke in the night, and heard above the thatch noises which</p>

<p>seemed to signify that the roof had turned itself into a gymnasium</p>

<p>of all the winds.  When she lit her lamp to get up in the morning</p>

<p>she found that the snow had blown through a chink in the casement,</p>

<p>forming a white cone of the finest powder against the inside, and had</p>

<p>also come down the chimney, so that it lay sole-deep upon the floor,</p>

<p>on which her shoes left tracks when she moved about.  Without, the</p>

<p>storm drove so fast as to create a snow-mist in the kitchen; but as</p>

<p>yet it was too dark out-of-doors to see anything.</p>

<p>Tess knew that it was impossible to go on with the swedes; and by</p>

<p>the time she had finished breakfast beside the solitary little lamp,</p>

<p>Marian arrived to tell her that they were to join the rest of the</p>

<p>women at reed-drawing in the barn till the weather changed.  As soon,</p>

<p>therefore, as the uniform cloak of darkness without began to turn</p>

<p>to a disordered medley of grays, they blew out the lamp, wrapped</p>

<p>themselves up in their thickest pinners, tied their woollen cravats</p>

<p>round their necks and across their chests, and started for the barn.</p>

<p>The snow had followed the birds from the polar basin as a white</p>

<p>pillar of a cloud, and individual flakes could not be seen.  The</p>

<p>blast smelt of icebergs, arctic seas, whales, and white bears,</p>

<p>carrying the snow so that it licked the land but did not deepen on</p>

<p>it.  They trudged onwards with slanted bodies through the flossy</p>

<p>fields, keeping as well as they could in the shelter of hedges,</p>

<p>which, however, acted as strainers rather than screens.  The air,</p>

<p>afflicted to pallor with the hoary multitudes that infested it,</p>

<p>twisted and spun them eccentrically, suggesting an achromatic chaos</p>

<p>of things.  But both the young women were fairly cheerful; such</p>

<p>weather on a dry upland is not in itself dispiriting.</p>

<p>"Ha-ha! the cunning northern birds knew this was coming," said</p>

<p>Marian.  "Depend upon't, they keep just in front o't all the way from</p>

<p>the North Star.  Your husband, my dear, is, I make no doubt, having</p>

<p>scorching weather all this time.  Lord, if he could only see his</p>

<p>pretty wife now!  Not that this weather hurts your beauty at all--in</p>

<p>fact, it rather does it good."</p>

<p>"You mustn't talk about him to me, Marian," said Tess severely.</p>

<p>"Well, but--surely you care for'n!  Do you?"</p>

<p>Instead of answering, Tess, with tears in her eyes, impulsively faced</p>

<p>in the direction in which she imagined South America to lie, and,</p>

<p>putting up her lips, blew out a passionate kiss upon the snowy wind.</p>

<p>"Well, well, I know you do.  But 'pon my body, it is a rum life for</p>

<p>a married couple!  There--I won't say another word!  Well, as for</p>

<p>the weather, it won't hurt us in the wheat-barn; but reed-drawing is</p>

<p>fearful hard work--worse than swede-hacking.  I can stand it because</p>

<p>I'm stout; but you be slimmer than I.  I can't think why maister</p>

<p>should have set 'ee at it."</p>

<p>They reached the wheat-barn and entered it.  One end of the long</p>

<p>structure was full of corn; the middle was where the reed-drawing was</p>

<p>carried on, and there had already been placed in the reed-press the</p>

<p>evening before as many sheaves of wheat as would be sufficient for</p>

<p>the women to draw from during the day.</p>

<p>"Why, here's Izz!" said Marian.</p>

<p>Izz it was, and she came forward.  She had walked all the way from</p>

<p>her mother's home on the previous afternoon, and, not deeming the</p>

<p>distance so great, had been belated, arriving, however, just before</p>

<p>the snow began, and sleeping at the alehouse.  The farmer had agreed</p>

<p>with her mother at market to take her on if she came to-day, and she</p>

<p>had been afraid to disappoint him by delay.</p>

<p>In addition to Tess, Marian, and Izz, there were two women from a</p>

<p>neighbouring village; two Amazonian sisters, whom Tess with a start</p>

<p>remembered as Dark Car, the Queen of Spades, and her junior, the</p>

<p>Queen of Diamonds--those who had tried to fight with her in the</p>

<p>midnight quarrel at Trantridge.  They showed no recognition of her,</p>

<p>and possibly had none, for they had been under the influence of</p>

<p>liquor on that occasion, and were only temporary sojourners there</p>

<p>as here.  They did all kinds of men's work by preference, including</p>

<p>well-sinking, hedging, ditching, and excavating, without any sense of</p>

<p>fatigue.  Noted reed-drawers were they too, and looked round upon the</p>

<p>other three with some superciliousness.</p>

<p>Putting on their gloves, all set to work in a row in front of the</p>

<p>press, an erection formed of two posts connected by a cross-beam,</p>

<p>under which the sheaves to be drawn from were laid ears outward, the</p>

<p>beam being pegged down by pins in the uprights, and lowered as the</p>

<p>sheaves diminished.</p>

<p>The day hardened in colour, the light coming in at the barndoors</p>

<p>upwards from the snow instead of downwards from the sky.  The girls</p>

<p>pulled handful after handful from the press; but by reason of the</p>

<p>presence of the strange women, who were recounting scandals, Marian</p>

<p>and Izz could not at first talk of old times as they wished to do.</p>

<p>Presently they heard the muffled tread of a horse, and the farmer</p>

<p>rode up to the barndoor.  When he had dismounted he came close to</p>

<p>Tess, and remained looking musingly at the side of her face.  She had</p>

<p>not turned at first, but his fixed attitude led her to look round,</p>

<p>when she perceived that her employer was the native of Trantridge</p>

<p>from whom she had taken flight on the high-road because of his</p>

<p>allusion to her history.</p>

<p>He waited till she had carried the drawn bundles to the pile outside,</p>

<p>when he said, "So you be the young woman who took my civility in such</p>

<p>ill part?  Be drowned if I didn't think you might be as soon as I</p>

<p>heard of your being hired!  Well, you thought you had got the better</p>

<p>of me the first time at the inn with your fancy-man, and the second</p>

<p>time on the road, when you bolted; but now I think I've got the</p>

<p>better you."  He concluded with a hard laugh.</p>

<p>Tess, between the Amazons and the farmer, like a bird caught in a</p>

<p>clap-net, returned no answer, continuing to pull the straw.  She</p>

<p>could read character sufficiently well to know by this time that she</p>

<p>had nothing to fear from her employer's gallantry; it was rather the</p>

<p>tyranny induced by his mortification at Clare's treatment of him.</p>

<p>Upon the whole she preferred that sentiment in man and felt brave</p>

<p>enough to endure it.</p>

<p>"You thought I was in love with 'ee I suppose?  Some women are such</p>

<p>fools, to take every look as serious earnest.  But there's nothing</p>

<p>like a winter afield for taking that nonsense out o' young wenches'</p>

<p>heads; and you've signed and agreed till Lady-Day.  Now, are you</p>

<p>going to beg my pardon?"</p>

<p>"I think you ought to beg mine."</p>

<p>"Very well--as you like.  But we'll see which is master here.  Be</p>

<p>they all the sheaves you've done to-day?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"'Tis a very poor show.  Just see what they've done over there"</p>

<p>(pointing to the two stalwart women).  "The rest, too, have done</p>

<p>better than you."</p>

<p>"They've all practised it before, and I have not.  And I thought it</p>

<p>made no difference to you as it is task work, and we are only paid</p>

<p>for what we do."</p>

<p>"Oh, but it does.  I want the barn cleared."</p>

<p>"I am going to work all the afternoon instead of leaving at two as</p>

<p>the others will do."</p>

<p>He looked sullenly at her and went away.  Tess felt that she could</p>

<p>not have come to a much worse place; but anything was better than</p>

<p>gallantry.  When two o'clock arrived the professional reed-drawers</p>

<p>tossed off the last half-pint in their flagon, put down their hooks,</p>

<p>tied their last sheaves, and went away.  Marian and Izz would have</p>

<p>done likewise, but on hearing that Tess meant to stay, to make up</p>

<p>by longer hours for her lack of skill, they would not leave her.</p>

<p>Looking out at the snow, which still fell, Marian exclaimed, "Now,</p>

<p>we've got it all to ourselves."  And so at last the conversation</p>

<p>turned to their old experiences at the dairy; and, of course, the</p>

<p>incidents of their affection for Angel Clare.</p>

<p>"Izz and Marian," said Mrs Angel Clare, with a dignity which was</p>

<p>extremely touching, seeing how very little of a wife she was: "I</p>

<p>can't join in talk with you now, as I used to do, about Mr Clare; you</p>

<p>will see that I cannot; because, although he is gone away from me for</p>

<p>the present, he is my husband."</p>

<p>Izz was by nature the sauciest and most caustic of all the four girls</p>

<p>who had loved Clare.  "He was a very splendid lover, no doubt," she</p>

<p>said; "but I don't think he is a too fond husband to go away from you</p>

<p>so soon."</p>

<p>"He had to go--he was obliged to go, to see about the land over</p>

<p>there!" pleaded Tess.</p>

<p>"He might have tided 'ee over the winter."</p>

<p>"Ah--that's owing to an accident--a misunderstanding; and we won't</p>

<p>argue it," Tess answered, with tearfulness in her words.  "Perhaps</p>

<p>there's a good deal to be said for him!  He did not go away, like</p>

<p>some husbands, without telling me; and I can always find out where</p>

<p>he is."</p>

<p>After this they continued for some long time in a reverie, as they</p>

<p>went on seizing the ears of corn, drawing out the straw, gathering</p>

<p>it under their arms, and cutting off the ears with their bill-hooks,</p>

<p>nothing sounding in the barn but the swish of the straw and the</p>

<p>crunch of the hook.  Then Tess suddenly flagged, and sank down upon</p>

<p>the heap of wheat-ears at her feet.</p>

<p>"I knew you wouldn't be able to stand it!" cried Marian.  "It wants</p>

<p>harder flesh than yours for this work."</p>

<p>Just then the farmer entered.  "Oh, that's how you get on when I am</p>

<p>away," he said to her.</p>

<p>"But it is my own loss," she pleaded.  "Not yours."</p>

<p>"I want it finished," he said doggedly, as he crossed the barn and</p>

<p>went out at the other door.</p>

<p>"Don't 'ee mind him, there's a dear," said Marian.  "I've worked here</p>

<p>before.  Now you go and lie down there, and Izz and I will make up</p>

<p>your number."</p>

<p>"I don't like to let you do that.  I'm taller than you, too."</p>

<p>However, she was so overcome that she consented to lie down awhile,</p>

<p>and reclined on a heap of pull-tails--the refuse after the straight</p>

<p>straw had been drawn--thrown up at the further side of the barn.  Her</p>

<p>succumbing had been as largely owning to agitation at the re-opening</p>

<p>the subject of her separation from her husband as to the hard work.</p>

<p>She lay in a state of percipience without volition, and the rustle of</p>

<p>the straw and the cutting of the ears by the others had the weight of</p>

<p>bodily touches.</p>

<p>She could hear from her corner, in addition to these noises, the</p>

<p>murmur of their voices.  She felt certain that they were continuing</p>

<p>the subject already broached, but their voices were so low that she</p>

<p>could not catch the words.  At last Tess grew more and more anxious</p>

<p>to know what they were saying, and, persuading herself that she felt</p>

<p>better, she got up and resumed work.</p>

<p>Then Izz Huett broke down.  She had walked more than a dozen miles</p>

<p>the previous evening, had gone to bed at midnight, and had risen</p>

<p>again at five o'clock.  Marian alone, thanks to her bottle of liquor</p>

<p>and her stoutness of build, stood the strain upon back and arms</p>

<p>without suffering.  Tess urged Izz to leave off, agreeing, as she</p>

<p>felt better, to finish the day without her, and make equal division</p>

<p>of the number of sheaves.</p>

<p>Izz accepted the offer gratefully, and disappeared through the great</p>

<p>door into the snowy track to her lodging.  Marian, as was the case</p>

<p>every afternoon at this time on account of the bottle, began to feel</p>

<p>in a romantic vein.</p>

<p>"I should not have thought it of him--never!" she said in a dreamy</p>

<p>tone.  "And I loved him so!  I didn't mind his having YOU.  But this</p>

<p>about Izz is too bad!"</p>

<p>Tess, in her start at the words, narrowly missed cutting off a finger</p>

<p>with the bill-hook.</p>

<p>"Is it about my husband?" she stammered.</p>

<p>"Well, yes.  Izz said, 'Don't 'ee tell her'; but I am sure I can't</p>

<p>help it!  It was what he wanted Izz to do.  He wanted her to go off</p>

<p>to Brazil with him."</p>

<p>Tess's face faded as white as the scene without, and its curves</p>

<p>straightened.  "And did Izz refuse to go?" she asked.</p>

<p>"I don't know.  Anyhow he changed his mind."</p>

<p>"Pooh--then he didn't mean it!  'Twas just a man's jest!"</p>

<p>"Yes he did; for he drove her a good-ways towards the station."</p>

<p>"He didn't take her!"</p>

<p>They pulled on in silence till Tess, without any premonitory</p>

<p>symptoms, burst out crying.</p>

<p>"There!" said Marian.  "Now I wish I hadn't told 'ee!"</p>

<p>"No.  It is a very good thing that you have done!  I have been living</p>

<p>on in a thirtover, lackaday way, and have not seen what it may lead</p>

<p>to!  I ought to have sent him a letter oftener.  He said I could not</p>

<p>go to him, but he didn't say I was not to write as often as I liked.</p>

<p>I won't dally like this any longer!  I have been very wrong and</p>

<p>neglectful in leaving everything to be done by him!"</p>

<p>The dim light in the barn grew dimmer, and they could see to work no</p>

<p>longer.  When Tess had reached home that evening, and had entered</p>

<p>into the privacy of her little white-washed chamber, she began</p>

<p>impetuously writing a letter to Clare.  But falling into doubt, she</p>

<p>could not finish it.  Afterwards she took the ring from the ribbon on</p>

<p>which she wore it next her heart, and retained it on her finger all</p>

<p>night, as if to fortify herself in the sensation that she was really</p>

<p>the wife of this elusive lover of hers, who could propose that Izz</p>

<p>should go with him abroad, so shortly after he had left her.  Knowing</p>

<p>that, how could she write entreaties to him, or show that she cared</p>

<p>for him any more?</p>

<p>XLIV</p>

<p>By the disclosure in the barn her thoughts were led anew in the</p>

<p>direction which they had taken more than once of late--to the distant</p>

<p>Emminster Vicarage.  It was through her husband's parents that she</p>

<p>had been charged to send a letter to Clare if she desired; and to</p>

<p>write to them direct if in difficulty.  But that sense of her having</p>

<p>morally no claim upon him had always led Tess to suspend her impulse</p>

<p>to send these notes; and to the family at the Vicarage, therefore,</p>

<p>as to her own parents since her marriage, she was virtually</p>

<p>non-existent.  This self-effacement in both directions had been quite</p>

<p>in consonance with her independent character of desiring nothing</p>

<p>by way of favour or pity to which she was not entitled on a fair</p>

<p>consideration of her deserts.  She had set herself to stand or fall</p>

<p>by her qualities, and to waive such merely technical claims upon a</p>

<p>strange family as had been established for her by the flimsy fact of</p>

<p>a member of that family, in a season of impulse, writing his name in</p>

<p>a church-book beside hers.</p>

<p>But now that she was stung to a fever by Izz's tale, there was a</p>

<p>limit to her powers of renunciation.  Why had her husband not written</p>

<p>to her?  He had distinctly implied that he would at least let her</p>

<p>know of the locality to which he had journeyed; but he had not sent a</p>

<p>line to notify his address.  Was he really indifferent?  But was he</p>

<p>ill?  Was it for her to make some advance?  Surely she might summon</p>

<p>the courage of solicitude, call at the Vicarage for intelligence, and</p>

<p>express her grief at his silence.  If Angel's father were the good</p>

<p>man she had heard him represented to be, he would be able to enter</p>

<p>into her heart-starved situation.  Her social hardships she could</p>

<p>conceal.</p>

<p>To leave the farm on a week-day was not in her power; Sunday was</p>

<p>the only possible opportunity.  Flintcomb-Ash being in the middle</p>

<p>of the cretaceous tableland over which no railway had climbed as</p>

<p>yet, it would be necessary to walk.  And the distance being fifteen</p>

<p>miles each way she would have to allow herself a long day for the</p>

<p>undertaking by rising early.</p>

<p>A fortnight later, when the snow had gone, and had been followed by</p>

<p>a hard black frost, she took advantage of the state of the roads to</p>

<p>try the experiment.  At four o'clock that Sunday morning she came</p>

<p>downstairs and stepped out into the starlight.  The weather was still</p>

<p>favourable, the ground ringing under her feet like an anvil.</p>

<p>Marian and Izz were much interested in her excursion, knowing that</p>

<p>the journey concerned her husband.  Their lodgings were in a cottage</p>

<p>a little further along the lane, but they came and assisted Tess</p>

<p>in her departure, and argued that she should dress up in her very</p>

<p>prettiest guise to captivate the hearts of her parents-in-law; though</p>

<p>she, knowing of the austere and Calvinistic tenets of old Mr Clare,</p>

<p>was indifferent, and even doubtful.  A year had now elapsed since</p>

<p>her sad marriage, but she had preserved sufficient draperies from</p>

<p>the wreck of her then full wardrobe to clothe her very charmingly as</p>

<p>a simple country girl with no pretensions to recent fashion; a soft</p>

<p>gray woollen gown, with white crape quilling against the pink skin of</p>

<p>her face and neck, and a black velvet jacket and hat.</p>

<p>"'Tis a thousand pities your husband can't see 'ee now--you do look</p>

<p>a real beauty!" said Izz Huett, regarding Tess as she stood on</p>

<p>the threshold between the steely starlight without and the yellow</p>

<p>candlelight within.  Izz spoke with a magnanimous abandonment of</p>

<p>herself to the situation; she could not be--no woman with a heart</p>

<p>bigger than a hazel-nut could be--antagonistic to Tess in her</p>

<p>presence, the influence which she exercised over those of her own sex</p>

<p>being of a warmth and strength quite unusual, curiously overpowering</p>

<p>the less worthy feminine feelings of spite and rivalry.</p>

<p>With a final tug and touch here, and a slight brush there, they let</p>

<p>her go; and she was absorbed into the pearly air of the fore-dawn.</p>

<p>They heard her footsteps tap along the hard road as she stepped out</p>

<p>to her full pace.  Even Izz hoped she would win, and, though without</p>

<p>any particular respect for her own virtue, felt glad that she had</p>

<p>been prevented wronging her friend when momentarily tempted by Clare.</p>

<p>It was a year ago, all but a day, that Clare had married Tess, and</p>

<p>only a few days less than a year that he had been absent from her.</p>

<p>Still, to start on a brisk walk, and on such an errand as hers, on a</p>

<p>dry clear wintry morning, through the rarefied air of these chalky</p>

<p>hogs'-backs, was not depressing; and there is no doubt that her dream</p>

<p>at starting was to win the heart of her mother-in-law, tell her whole</p>

<p>history to that lady, enlist her on her side, and so gain back the</p>

<p>truant.</p>

<p>In time she reached the edge of the vast escarpment below which</p>

<p>stretched the loamy Vale of Blackmoor, now lying misty and still</p>

<p>in the dawn.  Instead of the colourless air of the uplands, the</p>

<p>atmosphere down there was a deep blue.  Instead of the great</p>

<p>enclosures of a hundred acres in which she was now accustomed to</p>

<p>toil, there were little fields below her of less than half-a-dozen</p>

<p>acres, so numerous that they looked from this height like the meshes</p>

<p>of a net.  Here the landscape was whitey-brown; down there, as in</p>

<p>Froom Valley, it was always green.  Yet it was in that vale that her</p>

<p>sorrow had taken shape, and she did not love it as formerly.  Beauty</p>

<p>to her, as to all who have felt, lay not in the thing, but in what</p>

<p>the thing symbolized.</p>

<p>Keeping the Vale on her right, she steered steadily westward; passing</p>

<p>above the Hintocks, crossing at right-angles the high-road from</p>

<p>Sherton-Abbas to Casterbridge, and skirting Dogbury Hill and</p>

<p>High-Stoy, with the dell between them called "The Devil's Kitchen".</p>

<p>Still following the elevated way she reached Cross-in-Hand, where</p>

<p>the stone pillar stands desolate and silent, to mark the site of a</p>

<p>miracle, or murder, or both.  Three miles further she cut across the</p>

<p>straight and deserted Roman road called Long-Ash Lane; leaving which</p>

<p>as soon as she reached it she dipped down a hill by a transverse lane</p>

<p>into the small town or village of Evershead, being now about halfway</p>

<p>over the distance.  She made a halt here, and breakfasted a second</p>

<p>time, heartily enough--not at the Sow-and-Acorn, for she avoided</p>

<p>inns, but at a cottage by the church.</p>

<p>The second half of her journey was through a more gentle country, by</p>

<p>way of Benvill Lane.  But as the mileage lessened between her and the</p>

<p>spot of her pilgrimage, so did Tess's confidence decrease, and her</p>

<p>enterprise loom out more formidably.  She saw her purpose in such</p>

<p>staring lines, and the landscape so faintly, that she was sometimes</p>

<p>in danger of losing her way.  However, about noon she paused by a</p>

<p>gate on the edge of the basin in which Emminster and its Vicarage</p>

<p>lay.</p>

<p>The square tower, beneath which she knew that at that moment the</p>

<p>Vicar and his congregation were gathered, had a severe look in</p>

<p>her eyes.  She wished that she had somehow contrived to come on a</p>

<p>week-day.  Such a good man might be prejudiced against a woman who</p>

<p>had chosen Sunday, never realizing the necessities of her case.</p>

<p>But it was incumbent upon her to go on now.  She took off the thick</p>

<p>boots in which she had walked thus far, put on her pretty thin ones</p>

<p>of patent leather, and, stuffing the former into the hedge by the</p>

<p>gatepost where she might readily find them again, descended the hill;</p>

<p>the freshness of colour she had derived from the keen air thinning</p>

<p>away in spite of her as she drew near the parsonage.</p>

<p>Tess hoped for some accident that might favour her, but nothing</p>

<p>favoured her.  The shrubs on the Vicarage lawn rustled uncomfortably</p>

<p>in the frosty breeze; she could not feel by any stretch of</p>

<p>imagination, dressed to her highest as she was, that the house was</p>

<p>the residence of near relations; and yet nothing essential, in nature</p>

<p>or emotion, divided her from them: in pains, pleasures, thoughts,</p>

<p>birth, death, and after-death, they were the same.</p>

<p>She nerved herself by an effort, entered the swing-gate, and rang</p>

<p>the door-bell.  The thing was done; there could be no retreat.  No;</p>

<p>the thing was not done.  Nobody answered to her ringing.  The effort</p>

<p>had to be risen to and made again.  She rang a second time, and the</p>

<p>agitation of the act, coupled with her weariness after the fifteen</p>

<p>miles' walk, led her support herself while she waited by resting her</p>

<p>hand on her hip, and her elbow against the wall of the porch.  The</p>

<p>wind was so nipping that the ivy-leaves had become wizened and gray,</p>

<p>each tapping incessantly upon its neighbour with a disquieting stir</p>

<p>of her nerves.  A piece of blood-stained paper, caught up from some</p>

<p>meat-buyer's dust-heap, beat up and down the road without the gate;</p>

<p>too flimsy to rest, too heavy to fly away; and a few straws kept it</p>

<p>company.</p>

<p>The second peal had been louder, and still nobody came.  Then she</p>

<p>walked out of the porch, opened the gate, and passed through.  And</p>

<p>though she looked dubiously at the house-front as if inclined to</p>

<p>return, it was with a breath of relied that she closed the gate.  A</p>

<p>feeling haunted her that she might have been recognized (though how</p>

<p>she could not tell), and orders been given not to admit her.</p>

<p>Tess went as far as the corner.  She had done all she could do; but</p>

<p>determined not to escape present trepidation at the expense of future</p>

<p>distress, she walked back again quite past the house, looking up at</p>

<p>all the windows.</p>

<p>Ah--the explanation was that they were all at church, every one.  She</p>

<p>remembered her husband saying that his father always insisted upon</p>

<p>the household, servants included, going to morning-service, and,</p>

<p>as a consequence, eating cold food when they came home.  It was,</p>

<p>therefore, only necessary to wait till the service was over.  She</p>

<p>would not make herself conspicuous by waiting on the spot, and she</p>

<p>started to get past the church into the lane.  But as she reached the</p>

<p>churchyard-gate the people began pouring out, and Tess found herself</p>

<p>in the midst of them.</p>

<p>The Emminster congregation looked at her as only a congregation of</p>

<p>small country-townsfolk walking home at its leisure can look at a</p>

<p>woman out of the common whom it perceives to be a stranger.  She</p>

<p>quickened her pace, and ascended the the road by which she had come,</p>

<p>to find a retreat between its hedges till the Vicar's family should</p>

<p>have lunched, and it might be convenient for them to receive her.</p>

<p>She soon distanced the churchgoers, except two youngish men, who,</p>

<p>linked arm-in-arm, were beating up behind her at a quick step.</p>

<p>As they drew nearer she could hear their voices engaged in earnest</p>

<p>discourse, and, with the natural quickness of a woman in her</p>

<p>situation, did not fail to recognize in those noises the quality</p>

<p>of her husband's tones.  The pedestrians were his two brothers.</p>

<p>Forgetting all her plans, Tess's one dread was lest they should</p>

<p>overtake her now, in her disorganized condition, before she was</p>

<p>prepared to confront them; for though she felt that they could not</p>

<p>identify her, she instinctively dreaded their scrutiny.  The more</p>

<p>briskly they walked, the more briskly walked she.  They were plainly</p>

<p>bent upon taking a short quick stroll before going indoors to lunch</p>

<p>or dinner, to restore warmth to limbs chilled with sitting through a</p>

<p>long service.</p>

<p>Only one person had preceded Tess up the hill--a ladylike young</p>

<p>woman, somewhat interesting, though, perhaps, a trifle _guindйe_</p>

<p>and prudish.  Tess had nearly overtaken her when the speed of her</p>

<p>brothers-in-law brought them so nearly behind her back that she could</p>

<p>hear every word of their conversation.  They said nothing, however,</p>

<p>which particularly interested her till, observing the young lady</p>

<p>still further in front, one of them remarked, "There is Mercy Chant.</p>

<p>Let us overtake her."</p>

<p>Tess knew the name.  It was the woman who had been destined for</p>

<p>Angel's life-companion by his and her parents, and whom he probably</p>

<p>would have married but for her intrusive self.  She would have known</p>

<p>as much without previous information if she had waited a moment, for</p>

<p>one of the brothers proceeded to say: "Ah! poor Angel, poor Angel!</p>

<p>I never see that nice girl without more and more regretting his</p>

<p>precipitancy in throwing himself away upon a dairymaid, or whatever</p>

<p>she may be.  It is a queer business, apparently.  Whether she has</p>

<p>joined him yet or not I don't know; but she had not done so some</p>

<p>months ago when I heard from him."</p>

<p>"I can't say.  He never tells me anything nowadays.  His</p>

<p>ill-considered marriage seems to have completed that estrangement</p>

<p>from me which was begun by his extraordinary opinions."</p>

<p>Tess beat up the long hill still faster; but she could not outwalk</p>

<p>them without exciting notice.  At last they outsped her altogether,</p>

<p>and passed her by.  The young lady still further ahead heard their</p>

<p>footsteps and turned.  Then there was a greeting and a shaking of</p>

<p>hands, and the three went on together.</p>

<p>They soon reached the summit of the hill, and, evidently intending</p>

<p>this point to be the limit of their promenade, slackened pace and</p>

<p>turned all three aside to the gate whereat Tess had paused an hour</p>

<p>before that time to reconnoitre the town before descending into it.</p>

<p>During their discourse one of the clerical brothers probed the hedge</p>

<p>carefully with his umbrella, and dragged something to light.</p>

<p>"Here's a pair of old boots," he said.  "Thrown away, I suppose, by</p>

<p>some tramp or other."</p>

<p>"Some imposter who wished to come into the town barefoot, perhaps,</p>

<p>and so excite our sympathies," said Miss Chant.  "Yes, it must have</p>

<p>been, for they are excellent walking-boots--by no means worn out.</p>

<p>What a wicked thing to do!  I'll carry them home for some poor</p>

<p>person."</p>

<p>Cuthbert Clare, who had been the one to find them, picked them up for</p>

<p>her with the crook of his stick; and Tess's boots were appropriated.</p>

<p>She, who had heard this, walked past under the screen of her woollen</p>

<p>veil till, presently looking back, she perceived that the church</p>

<p>party had left the gate with her boots and retreated down the hill.</p>

<p>Thereupon our heroine resumed her walk.  Tears, blinding tears, were</p>

<p>running down her face.  She knew that it was all sentiment, all</p>

<p>baseless impressibility, which had caused her to read the scene as</p>

<p>her own condemnation; nevertheless she could not get over it; she</p>

<p>could not contravene in her own defenceless person all those untoward</p>

<p>omens.  It was impossible to think of returning to the Vicarage.</p>

<p>Angel's wife felt almost as if she had been hounded up that hill like</p>

<p>a scorned thing by those--to her--superfine clerics.  Innocently</p>

<p>as the slight had been inflicted, it was somewhat unfortunate that</p>

<p>she had encountered the sons and not the father, who, despite his</p>

<p>narrowness, was far less starched and ironed than they, and had to</p>

<p>the full the gift of charity.  As she again thought of her dusty</p>

<p>boots she almost pitied those habiliments for the quizzing to which</p>

<p>they had been subjected, and felt how hopeless life was for their</p>

<p>owner.</p>

<p>"Ah!" she said, still sighing in pity of herself, "THEY didn't know</p>

<p>that I wore those over the roughest part of the road to save these</p>

<p>pretty ones HE bought for me--no--they did not know it!  And they</p>

<p>didn't think that HE chose the colour o' my pretty frock--no--how</p>

<p>could they?  If they had known perhaps they would not have cared,</p>

<p>for they don't care much for him, poor thing!"</p>

<p>Then she grieved for the beloved man whose conventional standard of</p>

<p>judgement had caused her all these latter sorrows; and she went her</p>

<p>way without knowing that the greatest misfortune of her life was this</p>

<p>feminine loss of courage at the last and critical moment through her</p>

<p>estimating her father-in-law by his sons.  Her present condition was</p>

<p>precisely one which would have enlisted the sympathies of old Mr and</p>

<p>Mrs Clare.  Their hearts went out of them at a bound towards extreme</p>

<p>cases, when the subtle mental troubles of the less desperate among</p>

<p>mankind failed to win their interest or regard.  In jumping at</p>

<p>Publicans and Sinners they would forget that a word might be said for</p>

<p>the worries of Scribes and Pharisees; and this defect or limitation</p>

<p>might have recommended their own daughter-in-law to them at this</p>

<p>moment as a fairly choice sort of lost person for their love.</p>

<p>Thereupon she began to plod back along the road by which she had come</p>

<p>not altogether full of hope, but full of a conviction that a crisis</p>

<p>in her life was approaching.  No crisis, apparently, had supervened;</p>

<p>and there was nothing left for her to do but to continue upon that</p>

<p>starve-acre farm till she could again summon courage to face the</p>

<p>Vicarage.  She did, indeed, take sufficient interest in herself to</p>

<p>throw up her veil on this return journey, as if to let the world see</p>

<p>that she could at least exhibit a face such as Mercy Chant could</p>

<p>not show.  But it was done with a sorry shake of the head. "It is</p>

<p>nothing--it is nothing!" she said.  "Nobody loves it; nobody sees it.</p>

<p>Who cares about the looks of a castaway like me!"</p>

<p>Her journey back was rather a meander than a march.  It had no</p>

<p>sprightliness, no purpose; only a tendency.  Along the tedious length</p>

<p>of Benvill Lane she began to grow tired, and she leant upon gates and</p>

<p>paused by milestones.</p>

<p>She did not enter any house till, at the seventh or eighth mile, she</p>

<p>descended the steep long hill below which lay the village or townlet</p>

<p>of Evershead, where in the morning she had breakfasted with such</p>

<p>contrasting expectations.  The cottage by the church, in which she</p>

<p>again sat down, was almost the first at that end of the village, and</p>

<p>while the woman fetched her some milk from the pantry, Tess, looking</p>

<p>down the street, perceived that the place seemed quite deserted.</p>

<p>"The people are gone to afternoon service, I suppose?" she said.</p>

<p>"No, my dear," said the old woman.  "'Tis too soon for that; the</p>

<p>bells hain't strook out yet.  They be all gone to hear the preaching</p>

<p>in yonder barn.  A ranter preaches there between the services--an</p>

<p>excellent, fiery, Christian man, they say.  But, Lord, I don't go to</p>

<p>hear'n!  What comes in the regular way over the pulpit is hot enough</p>

<p>for I."</p>

<p>Tess soon went onward into the village, her footsteps echoing against</p>

<p>the houses as though it were a place of the dead.  Nearing the</p>

<p>central part, her echoes were intruded on by other sounds; and seeing</p>

<p>the barn not far off the road, she guessed these to be the utterances</p>

<p>of the preacher.</p>

<p>His voice became so distinct in the still clear air that she could</p>

<p>soon catch his sentences, though she was on the closed side of</p>

<p>the barn.  The sermon, as might be expected, was of the extremest</p>

<p>antinomian type; on justification by faith, as expounded in the</p>

<p>theology of St Paul.  This fixed idea of the rhapsodist was delivered</p>

<p>with animated enthusiasm, in a manner entirely declamatory, for he</p>

<p>had plainly no skill as a dialectician.  Although Tess had not heard</p>

<p>the beginning of the address, she learnt what the text had been from</p>

<p>its constant iteration--</p>

<p>   "O foolish galatians, who hath bewitched you, that ye</p>

<p>   should not obey the truth, before whose eyes Jesus Christ</p>

<p>   hath been evidently set forth, crucified among you?"</p>

<p>Tess was all the more interested, as she stood listening behind, in</p>

<p>finding that the preacher's doctrine was a vehement form of the view</p>

<p>of Angel's father, and her interest intensified when the speaker</p>

<p>began to detail his own spiritual experiences of how he had come by</p>

<p>those views.  He had, he said, been the greatest of sinners.  He had</p>

<p>scoffed; he had wantonly associated with the reckless and the lewd.</p>

<p>But a day of awakening had come, and, in a human sense, it had been</p>

<p>brought about mainly by the influence of a certain clergyman, whom he</p>

<p>had at first grossly insulted; but whose parting words had sunk into</p>

<p>his heart, and had remained there, till by the grace of Heaven they</p>

<p>had worked this change in him, and made him what they saw him.</p>

<p>But more startling to Tess than the doctrine had been the voice,</p>

<p>which, impossible as it seemed, was precisely that of Alec</p>

<p>d'Urberville.  Her face fixed in painful suspense, she came round</p>

<p>to the front of the barn, and passed before it.  The low winter sun</p>

<p>beamed directly upon the great double-doored entrance on this side;</p>

<p>one of the doors being open, so that the rays stretched far in over</p>

<p>the threshing-floor to the preacher and his audience, all snugly</p>

<p>sheltered from the northern breeze.  The listeners were entirely</p>

<p>villagers, among them being the man whom she had seen carrying the</p>

<p>red paint-pot on a former memorable occasion.  But her attention</p>

<p>was given to the central figure, who stood upon some sacks of corn,</p>

<p>facing the people and the door.  The three o'clock sun shone full</p>

<p>upon him, and the strange enervating conviction that her seducer</p>

<p>confronted her, which had been gaining ground in Tess ever since she</p>

<p>had heard his words distinctly, was at last established as a fact</p>

<p>indeed.</p>

<p>END OF PHASE THE FIFTH</p><empty-line /><p>Phase the Sixth: The Convert</p>

<p>XLV</p>

<p>Till this moment she had never seen or heard from d'Urberville since</p>

<p>her departure from Trantridge.</p>

<p>The rencounter came at a heavy moment, one of all moments calculated</p>

<p>to permit its impact with the least emotional shock.  But such was</p>

<p>unreasoning memory that, though he stood there openly and palpably a</p>

<p>converted man, who was sorrowing for his past irregularities, a fear</p>

<p>overcame her, paralyzing her movement so that she neither retreated</p>

<p>nor advanced.</p>

<p>To think of what emanated from that countenance when she saw it last,</p>

<p>and to behold it now! ...  There was the same handsome unpleasantness</p>

<p>of mien, but now he wore neatly trimmed, old-fashioned whiskers, the</p>

<p>sable moustache having disappeared; and his dress was half-clerical,</p>

<p>a modification which had changed his expression sufficiently to</p>

<p>abstract the dandyism from his features, and to hinder for a second</p>

<p>her belief in his identity.</p>

<p>To Tess's sense there was, just at first, a ghastly _bizarrerie_,</p>

<p>a grim incongruity, in the march of these solemn words of Scripture</p>

<p>out of such a mouth.  This too familiar intonation, less than four</p>

<p>years earlier, had brought to her ears expressions of such divergent</p>

<p>purpose that her heart became quite sick at the irony of the</p>

<p>contrast.</p>

<p>It was less a reform than a transfiguration.  The former curves of</p>

<p>sensuousness were now modulated to lines of devotional passion.</p>

<p>The lip-shapes that had meant seductiveness were now made to</p>

<p>express supplication; the glow on the cheek that yesterday could be</p>

<p>translated as riotousness was evangelized to-day into the splendour</p>

<p>of pious rhetoric; animalism had become fanaticism; Paganism,</p>

<p>Paulinism; the bold rolling eye that had flashed upon her form in</p>

<p>the old time with such mastery now beamed with the rude energy of a</p>

<p>theolatry that was almost ferocious.  Those black angularities which</p>

<p>his face had used to put on when his wishes were thwarted now did</p>

<p>duty in picturing the incorrigible backslider who would insist upon</p>

<p>turning again to his wallowing in the mire.</p>

<p>The lineaments, as such, seemed to complain.  They had been diverted</p>

<p>from their hereditary connotation to signify impressions for which</p>

<p>Nature did not intend them.  Strange that their very elevation was a</p>

<p>misapplication, that to raise seemed to falsify.</p>

<p>Yet could it be so?  She would admit the ungenerous sentiment no</p>

<p>longer.  D'Urberville was not the first wicked man who had turned</p>

<p>away from his wickedness to save his soul alive, and why should she</p>

<p>deem it unnatural in him?  It was but the usage of thought which had</p>

<p>been jarred in her at hearing good new words in bad old notes.  The</p>

<p>greater the sinner, the greater the saint; it was not necessary to</p>

<p>dive far into Christian history to discover that.</p>

<p>Such impressions as these moved her vaguely, and without strict</p>

<p>definiteness.  As soon as the nerveless pause of her surprise would</p>

<p>allow her to stir, her impulse was to pass on out of his sight.  He</p>

<p>had obviously not discerned her yet in her position against the sun.</p>

<p>But the moment that she moved again he recognized her.  The effect</p>

<p>upon her old lover was electric, far stronger than the effect of his</p>

<p>presence upon her.  His fire, the tumultuous ring of his eloquence,</p>

<p>seemed to go out of him.  His lip struggled and trembled under the</p>

<p>words that lay upon it; but deliver them it could not as long as she</p>

<p>faced him.  His eyes, after their first glance upon her face, hung</p>

<p>confusedly in every other direction but hers, but came back in a</p>

<p>desperate leap every few seconds.  This paralysis lasted, however,</p>

<p>but a short time; for Tess's energies returned with the atrophy of</p>

<p>his, and she walked as fast as she was able past the barn and onward.</p>

<p>As soon as she could reflect, it appalled her, this change in their</p>

<p>relative platforms.  He who had wrought her undoing was now on the</p>

<p>side of the Spirit, while she remained unregenerate.  And, as in the</p>

<p>legend, it had resulted that her Cyprian image had suddenly appeared</p>

<p>upon his altar, whereby the fire of the priest had been well nigh</p>

<p>extinguished.</p>

<p>She went on without turning her head.  Her back seemed to be endowed</p>

<p>with a sensitiveness to ocular beams--even her clothing--so alive</p>

<p>was she to a fancied gaze which might be resting upon her from the</p>

<p>outside of that barn.  All the way along to this point her heart</p>

<p>had been heavy with an inactive sorrow; now there was a change in</p>

<p>the quality of its trouble.  That hunger for affection too long</p>

<p>withheld was for the time displaced by an almost physical sense</p>

<p>of an implacable past which still engirdled her.  It intensified</p>

<p>her consciousness of error to a practical despair; the break of</p>

<p>continuity between her earlier and present existence, which she had</p>

<p>hoped for, had not, after all, taken place.  Bygones would never be</p>

<p>complete bygones till she was a bygone herself.</p>

<p>Thus absorbed, she recrossed the northern part of Long-Ash Lane at</p>

<p>right angles, and presently saw before her the road ascending whitely</p>

<p>to the upland along whose margin the remainder of her journey lay.</p>

<p>Its dry pale surface stretched severely onward, unbroken by a single</p>

<p>figure, vehicle, or mark, save some occasional brown horse-droppings</p>

<p>which dotted its cold aridity here and there.  While slowly breasting</p>

<p>this ascent Tess became conscious of footsteps behind her, and</p>

<p>turning she saw approaching that well-known form--so strangely</p>

<p>accoutred as the Methodist--the one personage in all the world she</p>

<p>wished not to encounter alone on this side of the grave.</p>

<p>There was not much time, however, for thought or elusion, and she</p>

<p>yielded as calmly as she could to the necessity of letting him</p>

<p>overtake her.  She saw that he was excited, less by the speed of his</p>

<p>walk than by the feelings within him.</p>

<p>"Tess!" he said.</p>

<p>She slackened speed without looking round.</p>

<p>"Tess!" he repeated.  "It is I--Alec d'Urberville."</p>

<p>She then looked back at him, and he came up.</p>

<p>"I see it is," she answered coldly.</p>

<p>"Well--is that all?  Yet I deserve no more!  Of course," he added,</p>

<p>with a slight laugh, "there is something of the ridiculous to your</p>

<p>eyes in seeing me like this.  But--I must put up with that. ...  I</p>

<p>heard you had gone away; nobody knew where.  Tess, you wonder why I</p>

<p>have followed you?"</p>

<p>"I do, rather; and I would that you had not, with all my heart!"</p>

<p>"Yes--you may well say it," he returned grimly, as they moved onward</p>

<p>together, she with unwilling tread.  "But don't mistake me; I beg</p>

<p>this because you may have been led to do so in noticing--if you did</p>

<p>notice it--how your sudden appearance unnerved me down there.  It was</p>

<p>but a momentary faltering; and considering what you have been to me,</p>

<p>it was natural enough.  But will helped me through it--though perhaps</p>

<p>you think me a humbug for saying it--and immediately afterwards I</p>

<p>felt that of all persons in the world whom it was my duty and desire</p>

<p>to save from the wrath to come--sneer if you like--the woman whom I</p>

<p>had so grievously wronged was that person.  I have come with that</p>

<p>sole purpose in view--nothing more."</p>

<p>There was the smallest vein of scorn in her words of rejoinder: "Have</p>

<p>you saved yourself?  Charity begins at home, they say."</p>

<p>"_I_ have done nothing!" said he indifferently. "Heaven, as I have</p>

<p>been telling my hearers, has done all.  No amount of contempt that</p>

<p>you can pour upon me, Tess, will equal what I have poured upon</p>

<p>myself--the old Adam of my former years!  Well, it is a strange</p>

<p>story; believe it or not; but I can tell you the means by which my</p>

<p>conversion was brought about, and I hope you will be interested</p>

<p>enough at least to listen.  Have you ever heard the name of the</p>

<p>parson of Emminster--you must have done do?--old Mr Clare; one of the</p>

<p>most earnest of his school; one of the few intense men left in the</p>

<p>Church; not so intense as the extreme wing of Christian believers</p>

<p>with which I have thrown in my lot, but quite an exception among the</p>

<p>Established clergy, the younger of whom are gradually attenuating the</p>

<p>true doctrines by their sophistries, till they are but the shadow of</p>

<p>what they were.  I only differ from him on the question of Church and</p>

<p>State--the interpretation of the text, 'Come out from among them and</p>

<p>be ye separate, saith the Lord'--that's all.  He is one who, I firmly</p>

<p>believe, has been the humble means of saving more souls in this</p>

<p>country than any other man you can name.  You have heard of him?"</p>

<p>"I have," she said.</p>

<p>"He came to Trantridge two or three years ago to preach on behalf of</p>

<p>some missionary society; and I, wretched fellow that I was, insulted</p>

<p>him when, in his disinterestedness, he tried to reason with me and</p>

<p>show me the way.  He did not resent my conduct, he simply said that</p>

<p>some day I should receive the first-fruits of the Spirit--that those</p>

<p>who came to scoff sometimes remained to pray.  There was a strange</p>

<p>magic in his words.  They sank into my mind.  But the loss of my</p>

<p>mother hit me most; and by degrees I was brought to see daylight.</p>

<p>Since then my one desire has been to hand on the true view to others,</p>

<p>and that is what I was trying to do to-day; though it is only lately</p>

<p>that I have preached hereabout.  The first months of my ministry have</p>

<p>been spent in the North of England among strangers, where I preferred</p>

<p>to make my earliest clumsy attempts, so as to acquire courage before</p>

<p>undergoing that severest of all tests of one's sincerity, addressing</p>

<p>those who have known one, and have been one's companions in the days</p>

<p>of darkness.  If you could only know, Tess, the pleasure of having a</p>

<p>good slap at yourself, I am sure--"</p>

<p>"Don't go on with it!" she cried passionately, as she turned away</p>

<p>from him to a stile by the wayside, on which she bent herself.  "I</p>

<p>can't believe in such sudden things!  I feel indignant with you for</p>

<p>talking to me like this, when you know--when you know what harm</p>

<p>you've done me!  You, and those like you, take your fill of pleasure</p>

<p>on earth by making the life of such as me bitter and black with</p>

<p>sorrow; and then it is a fine thing, when you have had enough of</p>

<p>that, to think of securing your pleasure in heaven by becoming</p>

<p>converted!  Out upon such--I don't believe in you--I hate it!"</p>

<p>"Tess," he insisted; "don't speak so!  It came to me like a jolly new</p>

<p>idea!  And you don't believe me?  What don't you believe?"</p>

<p>"Your conversion.  Your scheme of religion."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>She dropped her voice.  "Because a better man than you does not</p>

<p>believe in such."</p>

<p>"What a woman's reason!  Who is this better man?"</p>

<p>"I cannot tell you."</p>

<p>"Well," he declared, a resentment beneath his words seeming ready to</p>

<p>spring out at a moment's notice, "God forbid that I should say I am</p>

<p>a good man--and you know I don't say any such thing.  I am new to</p>

<p>goodness, truly; but newcomers see furthest sometimes."</p>

<p>"Yes," she replied sadly.  "But I cannot believe in your conversion</p>

<p>to a new spirit.  Such flashes as you feel, Alec, I fear don't last!"</p>

<p>Thus speaking she turned from the stile over which she had been</p>

<p>leaning, and faced him; whereupon his eyes, falling casually upon</p>

<p>the familiar countenance and form, remained contemplating her.  The</p>

<p>inferior man was quiet in him now; but it was surely not extracted,</p>

<p>nor even entirely subdued.</p>

<p>"Don't look at me like that!" he said abruptly.</p>

<p>Tess, who had been quite unconscious of her action and mien,</p>

<p>instantly withdrew the large dark gaze of her eyes, stammering with</p>

<p>a flush, "I beg your pardon!"  And there was revived in her the</p>

<p>wretched sentiment which had often come to her before, that in</p>

<p>inhabiting the fleshly tabernacle with which Nature had endowed her</p>

<p>she was somehow doing wrong.</p>

<p>"No, no!  Don't beg my pardon.  But since you wear a veil to hide</p>

<p>your good looks, why don't you keep it down?"</p>

<p>She pulled down the veil, saying hastily, "It was mostly to keep off</p>

<p>the wind."</p>

<p>"It may seem harsh of me to dictate like this," he went on; "but</p>

<p>it is better that I should not look too often on you.  It might be</p>

<p>dangerous."</p>

<p>"Ssh!" said Tess.</p>

<p>"Well, women's faces have had too much power over me already for me</p>

<p>not to fear them!  An evangelist has nothing to do with such as they;</p>

<p>and it reminds me of the old times that I would forget!"</p>

<p>After this their conversation dwindled to a casual remark now and</p>

<p>then as they rambled onward, Tess inwardly wondering how far he was</p>

<p>going with her, and not liking to send him back by positive mandate.</p>

<p>Frequently when they came to a gate or stile they found painted</p>

<p>thereon in red or blue letters some text of Scripture, and she</p>

<p>asked him if he knew who had been at the pains to blazon these</p>

<p>announcements.  He told her that the man was employed by himself and</p>

<p>others who were working with him in that district, to paint these</p>

<p>reminders that no means might be left untried which might move the</p>

<p>hearts of a wicked generation.</p>

<p>At length the road touched the spot called "Cross-in-Hand."  Of all</p>

<p>spots on the bleached and desolate upland this was the most forlorn.</p>

<p>It was so far removed from the charm which is sought in landscape by</p>

<p>artists and view-lovers as to reach a new kind of beauty, a negative</p>

<p>beauty of tragic tone.  The place took its name from a stone pillar</p>

<p>which stood there, a strange rude monolith, from a stratum unknown</p>

<p>in any local quarry, on which was roughly carved a human hand.</p>

<p>Differing accounts were given of its history and purport.  Some</p>

<p>authorities stated that a devotional cross had once formed the</p>

<p>complete erection thereon, of which the present relic was but the</p>

<p>stump; others that the stone as it stood was entire, and that it had</p>

<p>been fixed there to mark a boundary or place of meeting.  Anyhow,</p>

<p>whatever the origin of the relic, there was and is something</p>

<p>sinister, or solemn, according to mood, in the scene amid which it</p>

<p>stands; something tending to impress the most phlegmatic passer-by.</p>

<p>"I think I must leave you now," he remarked, as they drew near to</p>

<p>this spot.  "I have to preach at Abbot's-Cernel at six this evening,</p>

<p>and my way lies across to the right from here.  And you upset me</p>

<p>somewhat too, Tessy--I cannot, will not, say why.  I must go away and</p>

<p>get strength. ...  How is it that you speak so fluently now?  Who has</p>

<p>taught you such good English?"</p>

<p>"I have learnt things in my troubles," she said evasively.</p>

<p>"What troubles have you had?"</p>

<p>She told him of the first one--the only one that related to him.</p>

<p>D'Urberville was struck mute.  "I knew nothing of this till now!"</p>

<p>he next murmured.  "Why didn't you write to me when you felt your</p>

<p>trouble coming on?"</p>

<p>She did not reply; and he broke the silence by adding: "Well--you</p>

<p>will see me again."</p>

<p>"No," she answered.  "Do not again come near me!"</p>

<p>"I will think.  But before we part come here."  He stepped up to the</p>

<p>pillar.  "This was once a Holy Cross. Relics are not in my creed; but</p>

<p>I fear you at moments--far more than you need fear me at present; and</p>

<p>to lessen my fear, put your hand upon that stone hand, and swear that</p>

<p>you will never tempt me--by your charms or ways."</p>

<p>"Good God--how can you ask what is so unnecessary!  All that is</p>

<p>furthest from my thought!"</p>

<p>"Yes--but swear it."</p>

<p>Tess, half frightened, gave way to his importunity; placed her hand</p>

<p>upon the stone and swore.</p>

<p>"I am sorry you are not a believer," he continued; "that some</p>

<p>unbeliever should have got hold of you and unsettled your mind.  But</p>

<p>no more now.  At home at least I can pray for you; and I will; and</p>

<p>who knows what may not happen?  I'm off. Goodbye!"</p>

<p>He turned to a hunting-gate in the hedge and, without letting his</p>

<p>eyes again rest upon her, leapt over and struck out across the down</p>

<p>in the direction of Abbot's-Cernel.  As he walked his pace showed</p>

<p>perturbation, and by-and-by, as if instigated by a former thought,</p>

<p>he drew from his pocket a small book, between the leaves of which</p>

<p>was folded a letter, worn and soiled, as from much re-reading.</p>

<p>D'Urberville opened the letter.  It was dated several months before</p>

<p>this time, and was signed by Parson Clare.</p>

<p>The letter began by expressing the writer's unfeigned joy at</p>

<p>d'Urberville's conversion, and thanked him for his kindness in</p>

<p>communicating with the parson on the subject.  It expressed Mr</p>

<p>Clare's warm assurance of forgiveness for d'Urberville's former</p>

<p>conduct and his interest in the young man's plans for the future.</p>

<p>He, Mr Clare, would much have liked to see d'Urberville in the Church</p>

<p>to whose ministry he had devoted so many years of his own life, and</p>

<p>would have helped him to enter a theological college to that end; but</p>

<p>since his correspondent had possibly not cared to do this on account</p>

<p>of the delay it would have entailed, he was not the man to insist</p>

<p>upon its paramount importance.  Every man must work as he could best</p>

<p>work, and in the method towards which he felt impelled by the Spirit.</p>

<p>D'Urberville read and re-read this letter, and seemed to quiz himself</p>

<p>cynically.  He also read some passages from memoranda as he walked</p>

<p>till his face assumed a calm, and apparently the image of Tess no</p>

<p>longer troubled his mind.</p>

<p>She meanwhile had kept along the edge of the hill by which lay her</p>

<p>nearest way home.  Within the distance of a mile she met a solitary</p>

<p>shepherd.</p>

<p>"What is the meaning of that old stone I have passed?" she asked of</p>

<p>him.  "Was it ever a Holy Cross?"</p>

<p>"Cross--no; 'twer not a cross!  'Tis a thing of ill-omen, Miss.  It</p>

<p>was put up in wuld times by the relations of a malefactor who was</p>

<p>tortured there by nailing his hand to a post and afterwards hung.</p>

<p>The bones lie underneath.  They say he sold his soul to the devil,</p>

<p>and that he walks at times."</p>

<p>She felt the _petite mort_ at this unexpectedly gruesome information,</p>

<p>and left the solitary man behind her.  It was dusk when she drew near</p>

<p>to Flintcomb-Ash, and in the lane at the entrance to the hamlet she</p>

<p>approached a girl and her lover without their observing her.  They</p>

<p>were talking no secrets, and the clear unconcerned voice of the young</p>

<p>woman, in response to the warmer accents of the man, spread into the</p>

<p>chilly air as the one soothing thing within the dusky horizon, full</p>

<p>of a stagnant obscurity upon which nothing else intruded.  For a</p>

<p>moment the voices cheered the heart of Tess, till she reasoned that</p>

<p>this interview had its origin, on one side or the other, in the same</p>

<p>attraction which had been the prelude to her own tribulation.  When</p>

<p>she came close, the girl turned serenely and recognized her, the</p>

<p>young man walking off in embarrassment.  The woman was Izz Huett,</p>

<p>whose interest in Tess's excursion immediately superseded her own</p>

<p>proceedings.  Tess did not explain very clearly its results, and Izz,</p>

<p>who was a girl of tact, began to speak of her own little affair, a</p>

<p>phase of which Tess had just witnessed.</p>

<p>"He is Amby Seedling, the chap who used to sometimes come and help at</p>

<p>Talbothays," she explained indifferently.  "He actually inquired and</p>

<p>found out that I had come here, and has followed me.  He says he's</p>

<p>been in love wi' me these two years.  But I've hardly answered him."</p>

<p>XLVI</p>

<p>Several days had passed since her futile journey, and Tess was</p>

<p>afield.  The dry winter wind still blew, but a screen of thatched</p>

<p>hurdles erected in the eye of the blast kept its force away from her.</p>

<p>On the sheltered side was a turnip-slicing machine, whose bright blue</p>

<p>hue of new paint seemed almost vocal in the otherwise subdued scene.</p>

<p>Opposite its front was a long mound or "grave", in which the roots</p>

<p>had been preserved since early winter.  Tess was standing at the</p>

<p>uncovered end, chopping off with a bill-hook the fibres and earth</p>

<p>from each root, and throwing it after the operation into the slicer.</p>

<p>A man was turning the handle of the machine, and from its trough</p>

<p>came the newly-cut swedes, the fresh smell of whose yellow chips</p>

<p>was accompanied by the sounds of the snuffling wind, the smart swish</p>

<p>of the slicing-blades, and the choppings of the hook in Tess's</p>

<p>leather-gloved hand.</p>

<p>The wide acreage of blank agricultural brownness, apparent where</p>

<p>the swedes had been pulled, was beginning to be striped in wales of</p>

<p>darker brown, gradually broadening to ribands.  Along the edge of</p>

<p>each of these something crept upon ten legs, moving without haste</p>

<p>and without rest up and down the whole length of the field; it was</p>

<p>two horses and a man, the plough going between them, turning up the</p>

<p>cleared ground for a spring sowing.</p>

<p>For hours nothing relieved the joyless monotony of things. Then, far</p>

<p>beyond the ploughing-teams, a black speck was seen.  It had come from</p>

<p>the corner of a fence, where there was a gap, and its tendency was</p>

<p>up the incline, towards the swede-cutters.  From the proportions of</p>

<p>a mere point it advanced to the shape of a ninepin, and was soon</p>

<p>perceived to be a man in black, arriving from the direction of</p>

<p>Flintcomb-Ash.  The man at the slicer, having nothing else to do with</p>

<p>his eyes, continually observed the comer, but Tess, who was occupied,</p>

<p>did not perceive him till her companion directed her attention to his</p>

<p>approach.</p>

<p>It was not her hard taskmaster, Farmer Groby; it was one in a</p>

<p>semi-clerical costume, who now represented what had once been the</p>

<p>free-and-easy Alec d'Urberville.  Not being hot at his preaching</p>

<p>there was less enthusiasm about him now, and the presence of the</p>

<p>grinder seemed to embarrass him.  A pale distress was already on</p>

<p>Tess's face, and she pulled her curtained hood further over it.</p>

<p>D'Urberville came up and said quietly--</p>

<p>"I want to speak to you, Tess."</p>

<p>"You have refused my last request, not to come near me!" said she.</p>

<p>"Yes, but I have a good reason."</p>

<p>"Well, tell it."</p>

<p>"It is more serious than you may think."</p>

<p>He glanced round to see if he were overheard.  They were at some</p>

<p>distance from the man who turned the slicer, and the movement of the</p>

<p>machine, too, sufficiently prevented Alec's words reaching other</p>

<p>ears.  D'Urberville placed himself so as to screen Tess from the</p>

<p>labourer, turning his back to the latter.</p>

<p>"It is this," he continued, with capricious compunction.  "In</p>

<p>thinking of your soul and mine when we last met, I neglected to</p>

<p>inquire as to your worldly condition.  You were well dressed, and I</p>

<p>did not think of it.  But I see now that it is hard--harder than it</p>

<p>used to be when I--knew you--harder than you deserve.  Perhaps a good</p>

<p>deal of it is owning to me!"</p>

<p>She did not answer, and he watched her inquiringly, as, with bent</p>

<p>head, her face completely screened by the hood, she resumed her</p>

<p>trimming of the swedes.  By going on with her work she felt better</p>

<p>able to keep him outside her emotions.</p>

<p>"Tess," he added, with a sigh of discontent,--"yours was the very</p>

<p>worst case I ever was concerned in!  I had no idea of what had</p>

<p>resulted till you told me.  Scamp that I was to foul that innocent</p>

<p>life!  The whole blame was mine--the whole unconventional business</p>

<p>of our time at Trantridge.  You, too, the real blood of which I am</p>

<p>but the base imitation, what a blind young thing you were as to</p>

<p>possibilities!  I say in all earnestness that it is a shame for</p>

<p>parents to bring up their girls in such dangerous ignorance of the</p>

<p>gins and nets that the wicked may set for them, whether their motive</p>

<p>be a good one or the result of simple indifference."</p>

<p>Tess still did no more than listen, throwing down one globular root</p>

<p>and taking up another with automatic regularity, the pensive contour</p>

<p>of the mere fieldwoman alone marking her.</p>

<p>"But it is not that I came to say," d'Urberville went on.  "My</p>

<p>circumstances are these.  I have lost my mother since you were at</p>

<p>Trantridge, and the place is my own.  But I intend to sell it, and</p>

<p>devote myself to missionary work in Africa.  A devil of a poor hand</p>

<p>I shall make at the trade, no doubt.  However, what I want to ask</p>

<p>you is, will you put it in my power to do my duty--to make the only</p>

<p>reparation I can make for the trick played you: that is, will you be</p>

<p>my wife, and go with me? ...  I have already obtained this precious</p>

<p>document.  It was my old mother's dying wish."</p>

<p>He drew a piece of parchment from his pocket, with a slight fumbling</p>

<p>of embarrassment.</p>

<p>"What is it?" said she.</p>

<p>"A marriage licence."</p>

<p>"O no, sir--no!" she said quickly, starting back.</p>

<p>"You will not?  Why is that?"</p>

<p>And as he asked the question a disappointment which was not entirely</p>

<p>the disappointment of thwarted duty crossed d'Urberville's face.  It</p>

<p>was unmistakably a symptom that something of his old passion for her</p>

<p>had been revived; duty and desire ran hand-in-hand.</p>

<p>"Surely," he began again, in more impetuous tones, and then looked</p>

<p>round at the labourer who turned the slicer.</p>

<p>Tess, too, felt that the argument could not be ended there.</p>

<p>Informing the man that a gentleman had come to see her, with whom she</p>

<p>wished to walk a little way, she moved off with d'Urberville across</p>

<p>the zebra-striped field.  When they reached the first newly-ploughed</p>

<p>section he held out his hand to help her over it; but she stepped</p>

<p>forward on the summits of the earth-rolls as if she did not see him.</p>

<p>"You will not marry me, Tess, and make me a self-respecting man?" he</p>

<p>repeated, as soon as they were over the furrows.</p>

<p>"I cannot."</p>

<p>"But why?"</p>

<p>"You know I have no affection for you."</p>

<p>"But you would get to feel that in time, perhaps--as soon as you</p>

<p>really could forgive me?"</p>

<p>"Never!"</p>

<p>"Why so positive?"</p>

<p>"I love somebody else."</p>

<p>The words seemed to astonish him.</p>

<p>"You do?" he cried.  "Somebody else?  But has not a sense of what is</p>

<p>morally right and proper any weight with you?"</p>

<p>"No, no, no--don't say that!"</p>

<p>"Anyhow, then, your love for this other man may be only a passing</p>

<p>feeling which you will overcome--"</p>

<p>"No--no."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes!  Why not?"</p>

<p>"I cannot tell you."</p>

<p>"You must in honour!"</p>

<p>"Well then ... I have married him."</p>

<p>"Ah!" he exclaimed; and he stopped dead and gazed at</p>

<p>her.</p>

<p>"I did not wish to tell--I did not mean to!" she pleaded.  "It is a</p>

<p>secret here, or at any rate but dimly known.  So will you, PLEASE</p>

<p>will you, keep from questioning me?  You must remember that we are</p>

<p>now strangers."</p>

<p>"Strangers--are we?  Strangers!"</p>

<p>For a moment a flash of his old irony marked his face; but he</p>

<p>determinedly chastened it down.</p>

<p>"Is that man your husband?" he asked mechanically, denoting by a sign</p>

<p>the labourer who turned the machine.</p>

<p>"That man!" she said proudly.  "I should think not!"</p>

<p>"Who, then?"</p>

<p>"Do not ask what I do not wish to tell!" she begged, and flashed her</p>

<p>appeal to him from her upturned face and lash-shadowed eyes.</p>

<p>D'Urberville was disturbed.</p>

<p>"But I only asked for your sake!" he retorted hotly.  "Angels of</p>

<p>heaven!--God forgive me for such an expression--I came here, I swear,</p>

<p>as I thought for your good.  Tess--don't look at me so--I cannot</p>

<p>stand your looks!  There never were such eyes, surely, before</p>

<p>Christianity or since!  There--I won't lose my head; I dare not.</p>

<p>I own that the sight of you had waked up my love for you, which, I</p>

<p>believed, was extinguished with all such feelings.  But I thought</p>

<p>that our marriage might be a sanctification for us both.  'The</p>

<p>unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife, and the unbelieving</p>

<p>wife is sanctified by the husband,' I said to myself.  But my plan</p>

<p>is dashed from me; and I must bear the disappointment!"</p>

<p>He moodily reflected with his eyes on the ground.</p>

<p>"Married.  Married! ...  Well, that being so," he added, quite</p>

<p>calmly, tearing the licence slowly into halves and putting them in</p>

<p>his pocket; "that being prevented, I should like to do some good to</p>

<p>you and your husband, whoever he may be.  There are many questions</p>

<p>that I am tempted to ask, but I will not do so, of course, in</p>

<p>opposition to your wishes.  Though, if I could know your husband, I</p>

<p>might more easily benefit him and you.  Is he on this farm?"</p>

<p>"No," she murmured.  "He is far away."</p>

<p>"Far away?  From YOU?  What sort of husband can he be?"</p>

<p>"O, do not speak against him!  It was through you!  He found out--"</p>

<p>"Ah, is it so! ...  That's sad, Tess!"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"But to stay away from you--to leave you to work like this!"</p>

<p>"He does not leave me to work!" she cried, springing to the defence</p>

<p>of the absent one with all her fervour.  "He don't know it!  It is by</p>

<p>my own arrangement."</p>

<p>"Then, does he write?"</p>

<p>"I--I cannot tell you.  There are things which are private to</p>

<p>ourselves."</p>

<p>"Of course that means that he does not.  You are a deserted wife, my</p>

<p>fair Tess--"</p>

<p>In an impulse he turned suddenly to take her hand; the buff-glove was</p>

<p>on it, and he seized only the rough leather fingers which did not</p>

<p>express the life or shape of those within.</p>

<p>"You must not--you must not!" she cried fearfully, slipping her hand</p>

<p>from the glove as from a pocket, and leaving it in his grasp.  "O,</p>

<p>will you go away--for the sake of me and my husband--go, in the name</p>

<p>of your own Christianity!"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes; I will," he said abruptly, and thrusting the glove back to</p>

<p>her he turned to leave.  Facing round, however, he said, "Tess, as</p>

<p>God is my judge, I meant no humbug in taking your hand!"</p>

<p>A pattering of hoofs on the soil of the field, which they had not</p>

<p>noticed in their preoccupation, ceased close behind them; and a voice</p>

<p>reached her ear:</p>

<p>"What the devil are you doing away from your work at this time o'</p>

<p>day?"</p>

<p>Farmer Groby had espied the two figures from the distance, and had</p>

<p>inquisitively ridden across, to learn what was their business in his</p>

<p>field.</p>

<p>"Don't speak like that to her!" said d'Urberville, his face</p>

<p>blackening with something that was not Christianity.</p>

<p>"Indeed, Mister!  And what mid Methodist pa'sons have to do with</p>

<p>she?"</p>

<p>"Who is the fellow?" asked d'Urberville, turning to Tess.</p>

<p>She went close up to him.</p>

<p>"Go--I do beg you!" she said.</p>

<p>"What!  And leave you to that tyrant?  I can see in his face what a</p>

<p>churl he is."</p>

<p>"He won't hurt me.  HE'S not in love with me.  I can leave at</p>

<p>Lady-Day."</p>

<p>"Well, I have no right but to obey, I suppose.  But--well, goodbye!"</p>

<p>Her defender, whom she dreaded more than her assailant, having</p>

<p>reluctantly disappeared, the farmer continued his reprimand, which</p>

<p>Tess took with the greatest coolness, that sort of attack being</p>

<p>independent of sex.  To have as a master this man of stone, who would</p>

<p>have cuffed her if he had dared, was almost a relief after her former</p>

<p>experiences.  She silently walked back towards the summit of the</p>

<p>field that was the scene of her labour, so absorbed in the interview</p>

<p>which had just taken place that she was hardly aware that the nose of</p>

<p>Groby's horse almost touched her shoulders.</p>

<p>"If so be you make an agreement to work for me till Lady-Day, I'll</p>

<p>see that you carry it out," he growled.  "'Od rot the women--now</p>

<p>'tis one thing, and then 'tis another.  But I'll put up with it no</p>

<p>longer!"</p>

<p>Knowing very well that he did not harass the other women of the</p>

<p>farm as he harassed her out of spite for the flooring he had once</p>

<p>received, she did for one moment picture what might have been the</p>

<p>result if she had been free to accept the offer just made her of</p>

<p>being the monied Alec's wife.  It would have lifted her completely</p>

<p>out of subjection, not only to her present oppressive employer, but</p>

<p>to a whole world who seemed to despise her.  "But no, no!" she said</p>

<p>breathlessly; "I could not have married him now!  He is so unpleasant</p>

<p>to me."</p>

<p>That very night she began an appealing letter to Clare, concealing</p>

<p>from him her hardships, and assuring him of her undying affection.</p>

<p>Any one who had been in a position to read between the lines would</p>

<p>have seen that at the back of her great love was some monstrous</p>

<p>fear--almost a desperation--as to some secret contingencies which</p>

<p>were not disclosed.  But again she did not finish her effusion; he</p>

<p>had asked Izz to go with him, and perhaps he did not care for her at</p>

<p>all.  She put the letter in her box, and wondered if it would ever</p>

<p>reach Angel's hands.</p>

<p>After this her daily tasks were gone through heavily enough, and</p>

<p>brought on the day which was of great import to agriculturists--the</p>

<p>day of the Candlemas Fair.  It was at this fair that new engagements</p>

<p>were entered into for the twelve months following the ensuing</p>

<p>Lady-Day, and those of the farming population who thought of changing</p>

<p>their places duly attended at the county-town where the fair was</p>

<p>held.  Nearly all the labourers on Flintcomb-Ash farm intended</p>

<p>flight, and early in the morning there was a general exodus in the</p>

<p>direction of the town, which lay at a distance of from ten to a dozen</p>

<p>miles over hilly country.  Though Tess also meant to leave at the</p>

<p>quarter-day, she was one of the few who did not go to the fair,</p>

<p>having a vaguely-shaped hope that something would happen to render</p>

<p>another outdoor engagement unnecessary.</p>

<p>It was a peaceful February day, of wonderful softness for the time,</p>

<p>and one would almost have thought that winter was over.  She had</p>

<p>hardly finished her dinner when d'Urberville's figure darkened the</p>

<p>window of the cottage wherein she was a lodger, which she had all to</p>

<p>herself to-day.</p>

<p>Tess jumped up, but her visitor had knocked at the door, and she</p>

<p>could hardly in reason run away.  D'Urberville's knock, his walk up</p>

<p>to the door, had some indescribable quality of difference from his</p>

<p>air when she last saw him.  They seemed to be acts of which the doer</p>

<p>was ashamed.  She thought that she would not open the door; but, as</p>

<p>there was no sense in that either, she arose, and having lifted the</p>

<p>latch stepped back quickly.  He came in, saw her, and flung himself</p>

<p>down into a chair before speaking.</p>

<p>"Tess--I couldn't help it!" he began desperately, as he wiped his</p>

<p>heated face, which had also a superimposed flush of excitement.  "I</p>

<p>felt that I must call at least to ask how you are.  I assure you I</p>

<p>had not been thinking of you at all till I saw you that Sunday; now I</p>

<p>cannot get rid of your image, try how I may!  It is hard that a good</p>

<p>woman should do harm to a bad man; yet so it is.  If you would only</p>

<p>pray for me, Tess!"</p>

<p>The suppressed discontent of his manner was almost pitiable, and yet</p>

<p>Tess did not pity him.</p>

<p>"How can I pray for you," she said, "when I am forbidden to believe</p>

<p>that the great Power who moves the world would alter His plans on my</p>

<p>account?"</p>

<p>"You really think that?"</p>

<p>"Yes.  I have been cured of the presumption of thinking otherwise."</p>

<p>"Cured?  By whom?"</p>

<p>"By my husband, if I must tell."</p>

<p>"Ah--your husband--your husband!  How strange it seems!  I remember</p>

<p>you hinted something of the sort the other day.  What do you really</p>

<p>believe in these matters, Tess?" he asked.  "You seem to have no</p>

<p>religion--perhaps owing to me."</p>

<p>"But I have.  Though I don't believe in anything supernatural."</p>

<p>D'Urberville looked at her with misgiving.</p>

<p>"Then do you think that the line I take is all wrong?"</p>

<p>"A good deal of it."</p>

<p>"H'm--and yet I've felt so sure about it," he said uneasily.</p>

<p>"I believe in the SPIRIT of the Sermon on the Mount, and so did my</p>

<p>dear husband...  But I don't believe--"</p>

<p>Here she gave her negations.</p>

<p>"The fact is," said d'Urberville drily, "whatever your dear husband</p>

<p>believed you accept, and whatever he rejected you reject, without the</p>

<p>least inquiry or reasoning on your own part.  That's just like you</p>

<p>women.  Your mind is enslaved to his."</p>

<p>"Ah, because he knew everything!" said she, with a triumphant</p>

<p>simplicity of faith in Angel Clare that the most perfect man could</p>

<p>hardly have deserved, much less her husband.</p>

<p>"Yes, but you should not take negative opinions wholesale from</p>

<p>another person like that.  A pretty fellow he must be to teach you</p>

<p>such scepticism!"</p>

<p>"He never forced my judgement!  He would never argue on the subject</p>

<p>with me!  But I looked at it in this way; what he believed, after</p>

<p>inquiring deep into doctrines, was much more likely to be right than</p>

<p>what I might believe, who hadn't looked into doctrines at all."</p>

<p>"What used he to say?  He must have said something?"</p>

<p>She reflected; and with her acute memory for the letter of Angel</p>

<p>Clare's remarks, even when she did not comprehend their spirit, she</p>

<p>recalled a merciless polemical syllogism that she had heard him</p>

<p>use when, as it occasionally happened, he indulged in a species of</p>

<p>thinking aloud with her at his side.  In delivering it she gave also</p>

<p>Clare's accent and manner with reverential faithfulness.</p>

<p>"Say that again," asked d'Urberville, who had listened with the</p>

<p>greatest attention.</p>

<p>She repeated the argument, and d'Urberville thoughtfully murmured the</p>

<p>words after her.</p>

<p>"Anything else?" he presently asked.</p>

<p>"He said at another time something like this"; and she gave another,</p>

<p>which might possibly have been paralleled in many a work of the</p>

<p>pedigree ranging from the _Dictionnaire Philosophique_ to Huxley's</p>

<p>_Essays_.</p>

<p>"Ah--ha!  How do you remember them?"</p>

<p>"I wanted to believe what he believed, though he didn't wish me to;</p>

<p>and I managed to coax him to tell me a few of his thoughts.  I can't</p>

<p>say I quite understand that one; but I know it is right."</p>

<p>"H'm.  Fancy your being able to teach me what you don't know</p>

<p>yourself!"</p>

<p>He fell into thought.</p>

<p>"And so I threw in my spiritual lot with his," she resumed.  "I</p>

<p>didn't wish it to be different.  What's good enough for him is good</p>

<p>enough for me."</p>

<p>"Does he know that you are as big an infidel as he?"</p>

<p>"No--I never told him--if I am an infidel."</p>

<p>"Well--you are better off to-day that I am, Tess, after all!  You</p>

<p>don't believe that you ought to preach my doctrine, and, therefore,</p>

<p>do no despite to your conscience in abstaining.  I do believe I ought</p>

<p>to preach it, but, like the devils, I believe and tremble, for I</p>

<p>suddenly leave off preaching it, and give way to my passion for you."</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"Why," he said aridly; "I have come all the way here to see you</p>

<p>to-day!  But I started from home to go to Casterbridge Fair, where</p>

<p>I have undertaken to preach the Word from a waggon at half-past two</p>

<p>this afternoon, and where all the brethren are expecting me this</p>

<p>minute.  Here's the announcement."</p>

<p>He drew from his breast-pocket a poster whereon was printed the day,</p>

<p>hour, and place of meeting, at which he, d'Urberville, would preach</p>

<p>the Gospel as aforesaid.</p>

<p>"But how can you get there?" said Tess, looking at the clock.</p>

<p>"I cannot get there!  I have come here."</p>

<p>"What, you have really arranged to preach, and--"</p>

<p>"I have arranged to preach, and I shall not be there--by reason of my</p>

<p>burning desire to see a woman whom I once despised!--No, by my word</p>

<p>and truth, I never despised you; if I had I should not love you now!</p>

<p>Why I did not despise you was on account of your being unsmirched in</p>

<p>spite of all; you withdrew yourself from me so quickly and resolutely</p>

<p>when you saw the situation; you did not remain at my pleasure; so</p>

<p>there was one petticoat in the world for whom I had no contempt,</p>

<p>and you are she.  But you may well despise me now!  I thought I</p>

<p>worshipped on the mountains, but I find I still serve in the groves!</p>

<p>Ha! ha!"</p>

<p>"O Alec d'Urberville! what does this mean?  What have I done!"</p>

<p>"Done?" he said, with a soulless sneer in the word.  "Nothing</p>

<p>intentionally.  But you have been the means--the innocent means--of</p>

<p>my backsliding, as they call it.  I ask myself, am I, indeed, one of</p>

<p>those 'servants of corruption' who, 'after they have escaped the</p>

<p>pollutions of the world, are again entangled therein and overcome'--</p>

<p>whose latter end is worse than their beginning?"  He laid his hand on</p>

<p>her shoulder.  "Tess, my girl, I was on the way to, at least, social</p>

<p>salvation till I saw you again!" he said freakishly shaking her, as</p>

<p>if she were a child.  "And why then have you tempted me?  I was firm</p>

<p>as a man could be till I saw those eyes and that mouth again--surely</p>

<p>there never was such a maddening mouth since Eve's!"  His voice sank,</p>

<p>and a hot archness shot from his own black eyes.  "You temptress,</p>

<p>Tess; you dear damned witch of Babylon--I could not resist you as</p>

<p>soon as I met you again!"</p>

<p>"I couldn't help your seeing me again!" said Tess, recoiling.</p>

<p>"I know it--I repeat that I do not blame you.  But the fact remains.</p>

<p>When I saw you ill-used on the farm that day I was nearly mad to</p>

<p>think that I had no legal right to protect you--that I could not have</p>

<p>it; whilst he who has it seems to neglect you utterly!"</p>

<p>"Don't speak against him--he is absent!" she cried in much</p>

<p>excitement.  "Treat him honourably--he has never wronged you!  O</p>

<p>leave his wife before any scandal spreads that may do harm to his</p>

<p>honest name!"</p>

<p>"I will--I will," he said, like a man awakening from a luring dream.</p>

<p>"I have broken my engagement to preach to those poor drunken boobies</p>

<p>at the fair--it is the first time I have played such a practical</p>

<p>joke.  A month ago I should have been horrified at such a</p>

<p>possibility.  I'll go away--to swear--and--ah, can I! to keep away."</p>

<p>Then, suddenly: "One clasp, Tessy--one!  Only for old friendship--"</p>

<p>"I am without defence. Alec!  A good man's honour is in my keeping--</p>

<p>think--be ashamed!"</p>

<p>"Pooh!  Well, yes--yes!"</p>

<p>He clenched his lips, mortified with himself for his weakness.  His</p>

<p>eyes were equally barren of worldly and religious faith.  The corpses</p>

<p>of those old fitful passions which had lain inanimate amid the lines</p>

<p>of his face ever since his reformation seemed to wake and come</p>

<p>together as in a resurrection.  He went out indeterminately.</p>

<p>Though d'Urberville had declared that this breach of his engagement</p>

<p>to-day was the simple backsliding of a believer, Tess's words, as</p>

<p>echoed from Angel Clare, had made a deep impression upon him, and</p>

<p>continued to do so after he had left her.  He moved on in silence, as</p>

<p>if his energies were benumbed by the hitherto undreamt-of possibility</p>

<p>that his position was untenable.  Reason had had nothing to do with</p>

<p>his whimsical conversion, which was perhaps the mere freak of a</p>

<p>careless man in search of a new sensation, and temporarily impressed</p>

<p>by his mother's death.</p>

<p>The drops of logic Tess had let fall into the sea of his enthusiasm</p>

<p>served to chill its effervescence to stagnation.  He said to himself,</p>

<p>as he pondered again and again over the crystallized phrases that she</p>

<p>had handed on to him, "That clever fellow little thought that, by</p>

<p>telling her those things, he might be paving my way back to her!"</p>

<p>XLVII</p>

<p>It is the threshing of the last wheat-rick at Flintcomb-Ash farm. The</p>

<p>dawn of the March morning is singularly inexpressive, and there is</p>

<p>nothing to show where the eastern horizon lies.  Against the twilight</p>

<p>rises the trapezoidal top of the stack, which has stood forlornly</p>

<p>here through the washing and bleaching of the wintry weather.</p>

<p>When Izz Huett and Tess arrived at the scene of operations only a</p>

<p>rustling denoted that others had preceded them; to which, as the</p>

<p>light increased, there were presently added the silhouettes of two</p>

<p>men on the summit.  They were busily "unhaling" the rick, that</p>

<p>is, stripping off the thatch before beginning to throw down the</p>

<p>sheaves; and while this was in progress Izz and Tess, with the</p>

<p>other women-workers, in their whitey-brown pinners, stood waiting</p>

<p>and shivering, Farmer Groby having insisted upon their being on</p>

<p>the spot thus early to get the job over if possible by the end of</p>

<p>the day.  Close under the eaves of the stack, and as yet barely</p>

<p>visible, was the red tyrant that the women had come to serve--a</p>

<p>timber-framed construction, with straps and wheels appertaining--</p>

<p>the threshing-machine which, whilst it was going, kept up a</p>

<p>despotic demand upon the endurance of their muscles and nerves.</p>

<p>A little way off there was another indistinct figure; this one black,</p>

<p>with a sustained hiss that spoke of strength very much in reserve.</p>

<p>The long chimney running up beside an ash-tree, and the warmth which</p>

<p>radiated from the spot, explained without the necessity of much</p>

<p>daylight that here was the engine which was to act as the _primum</p>

<p>mobile_ of this little world.  By the engine stood a dark, motionless</p>

<p>being, a sooty and grimy embodiment of tallness, in a sort of trance,</p>

<p>with a heap of coals by his side: it was the engine-man.  The</p>

<p>isolation of his manner and colour lent him the appearance of a</p>

<p>creature from Tophet, who had strayed into the pellucid smokelessness</p>

<p>of this region of yellow grain and pale soil, with which he had</p>

<p>nothing in common, to amaze and to discompose its aborigines.</p>

<p>What he looked he felt.  He was in the agricultural world, but not of</p>

<p>it.  He served fire and smoke; these denizens of the fields served</p>

<p>vegetation, weather, frost, and sun.  He travelled with his engine</p>

<p>from farm to farm, from county to county, for as yet the steam</p>

<p>threshing-machine was itinerant in this part of Wessex.  He spoke in</p>

<p>a strange northern accent; his thoughts being turned inwards upon</p>

<p>himself, his eye on his iron charge, hardly perceiving the scenes</p>

<p>around him, and caring for them not at all: holding only strictly</p>

<p>necessary intercourse with the natives, as if some ancient doom</p>

<p>compelled him to wander here against his will in the service of his</p>

<p>Plutonic master.  The long strap which ran from the driving-wheel of</p>

<p>his engine to the red thresher under the rick was the sole tie-line</p>

<p>between agriculture and him.</p>

<p>While they uncovered the sheaves he stood apathetic beside his</p>

<p>portable repository of force, round whose hot blackness the morning</p>

<p>air quivered.  He had nothing to do with preparatory labour.  His</p>

<p>fire was waiting incandescent, his steam was at high pressure, in</p>

<p>a few seconds he could make the long strap move at an invisible</p>

<p>velocity.  Beyond its extent the environment might be corn, straw,</p>

<p>or chaos; it was all the same to him.  If any of the autochthonous</p>

<p>idlers asked him what he called himself, he replied shortly, "an</p>

<p>engineer."</p>

<p>The rick was unhaled by full daylight; the men then took their</p>

<p>places, the women mounted, and the work began.  Farmer Groby--or, as</p>

<p>they called him, "he"--had arrived ere this, and by his orders Tess</p>

<p>was placed on the platform of the machine, close to the man who fed</p>

<p>it, her business being to untie every sheaf of corn handed on to her</p>

<p>by Izz Huett, who stood next, but on the rick; so that the feeder</p>

<p>could seize it and spread it over the revolving drum, which whisked</p>

<p>out every grain in one moment.</p>

<p>They were soon in full progress, after a preparatory hitch or two,</p>

<p>which rejoiced the hearts of those who hated machinery.  The work</p>

<p>sped on till breakfast time, when the thresher was stopped for half</p>

<p>an hour; and on starting again after the meal the whole supplementary</p>

<p>strength of the farm was thrown into the labour of constructing the</p>

<p>straw-rick, which began to grow beside the stack of corn.  A hasty</p>

<p>lunch was eaten as they stood, without leaving their positions, and</p>

<p>then another couple of hours brought them near to dinner-time; the</p>

<p>inexorable wheel continuing to spin, and the penetrating hum of the</p>

<p>thresher to thrill to the very marrow all who were near the revolving</p>

<p>wire-cage.</p>

<p>The old men on the rising straw-rick talked of the past days</p>

<p>when they had been accustomed to thresh with flails on the oaken</p>

<p>barn-floor; when everything, even to winnowing, was effected by</p>

<p>hand-labour, which, to their thinking, though slow, produced better</p>

<p>results.  Those, too, on the corn-rick talked a little; but the</p>

<p>perspiring ones at the machine, including Tess, could not lighten</p>

<p>their duties by the exchange of many words.  It was the ceaselessness</p>

<p>of the work which tried her so severely, and began to make her</p>

<p>wish that she had never some to Flintcomb-Ash.  The women on the</p>

<p>corn-rick--Marian, who was one of them, in particular--could stop to</p>

<p>drink ale or cold tea from the flagon now and then, or to exchange</p>

<p>a few gossiping remarks while they wiped their faces or cleared the</p>

<p>fragments of straw and husk from their clothing; but for Tess there</p>

<p>was no respite; for, as the drum never stopped, the man who fed</p>

<p>it could not stop, and she, who had to supply the man with untied</p>

<p>sheaves, could not stop either, unless Marian changed places with</p>

<p>her, which she sometimes did for half an hour in spite of Groby's</p>

<p>objections that she was too slow-handed for a feeder.</p>

<p>For some probably economical reason it was usually a woman who was</p>

<p>chosen for this particular duty, and Groby gave as his motive in</p>

<p>selecting Tess that she was one of those who best combined strength</p>

<p>with quickness in untying, and both with staying power, and this may</p>

<p>have been true.  The hum of the thresher, which prevented speech,</p>

<p>increased to a raving whenever the supply of corn fell short of the</p>

<p>regular quantity.  As Tess and the man who fed could never turn their</p>

<p>heads she did not know that just before the dinner-hour a person had</p>

<p>come silently into the field by the gate, and had been standing under</p>

<p>a second rick watching the scene and Tess in particular.  He was</p>

<p>dressed in a tweed suit of fashionable pattern, and he twirled a gay</p>

<p>walking-cane.</p>

<p>"Who is that?" said Izz Huett to Marian.  She had at first addressed</p>

<p>the inquiry to Tess, but the latter could not hear it.</p>

<p>"Somebody's fancy-man, I s'pose," said Marian laconically.</p>

<p>"I'll lay a guinea he's after Tess."</p>

<p>"O no.  'Tis a ranter pa'son who's been sniffing after her lately;</p>

<p>not a dandy like this."</p>

<p>"Well--this is the same man."</p>

<p>"The same man as the preacher?  But he's quite different!"</p>

<p>"He hev left off his black coat and white neckercher, and hev cut off</p>

<p>his whiskers; but he's the same man for all that."</p>

<p>"D'ye really think so?  Then I'll tell her," said Marian.</p>

<p>"Don't.  She'll see him soon enough, good-now."</p>

<p>"Well, I don't think it at all right for him to join his preaching to</p>

<p>courting a married woman, even though her husband mid be abroad, and</p>

<p>she, in a sense, a widow."</p>

<p>"Oh--he can do her no harm," said Izz drily.  "Her mind can no more</p>

<p>be heaved from that one place where it do bide than a stooded waggon</p>

<p>from the hole he's in.  Lord love 'ee, neither court-paying, nor</p>

<p>preaching, nor the seven thunders themselves, can wean a woman when</p>

<p>'twould be better for her that she should be weaned."</p>

<p>Dinner-time came, and the whirling ceased; whereupon Tess left her</p>

<p>post, her knees trembling so wretchedly with the shaking of the</p>

<p>machine that she could scarcely walk.</p>

<p>"You ought to het a quart o' drink into 'ee, as I've done," said</p>

<p>Marian.  "You wouldn't look so white then.  Why, souls above us,</p>

<p>your face is as if you'd been hagrode!"</p>

<p>It occurred to the good-natured Marian that, as Tess was so tired,</p>

<p>her discovery of her visitor's presence might have the bad effect of</p>

<p>taking away her appetite; and Marian was thinking of inducing Tess</p>

<p>to descend by a ladder on the further side of the stack when the</p>

<p>gentleman came forward and looked up.</p>

<p>Tess uttered a short little "Oh!"  And a moment after she said,</p>

<p>quickly, "I shall eat my dinner here--right on the rick."</p>

<p>Sometimes, when they were so far from their cottages, they all did</p>

<p>this; but as there was rather a keen wind going to-day, Marian and</p>

<p>the rest descended, and sat under the straw-stack.</p>

<p>The newcomer was, indeed, Alec d'Urberville, the late Evangelist,</p>

<p>despite his changed attire and aspect.  It was obvious at a glance</p>

<p>that the original _Weltlust_ had come back; that he had restored</p>

<p>himself, as nearly as a man could do who had grown three or four</p>

<p>years older, to the old jaunty, slapdash guise under which Tess</p>

<p>had first known her admirer, and cousin so-called.  Having decided</p>

<p>to remain where she was, Tess sat down among the bundles, out of</p>

<p>sight of the ground, and began her meal; till, by-and-by, she heard</p>

<p>footsteps on the ladder, and immediately after Alec appeared upon the</p>

<p>stack--now an oblong and level platform of sheaves.  He strode across</p>

<p>them, and sat down opposite of her without a word.</p>

<p>Tess continued to eat her modest dinner, a slice of thick pancake</p>

<p>which she had brought with her.  The other workfolk were by this</p>

<p>time all gathered under the rick, where the loose straw formed a</p>

<p>comfortable retreat.</p>

<p>"I am here again, as you see," said d'Urberville.</p>

<p>"Why do you trouble me so!" she cried, reproach flashing from her</p>

<p>very finger-ends.</p>

<p>"I trouble YOU?  I think I may ask, why do you trouble me?"</p>

<p>"Sure, I don't trouble you any-when!"</p>

<p>"You say you don't?  But you do!  You haunt me.  Those very eyes that</p>

<p>you turned upon my with such a bitter flash a moment ago, they come</p>

<p>to me just as you showed them then, in the night and in the day!</p>

<p>Tess, ever since you told me of that child of ours, it is just as if</p>

<p>my feelings, which have been flowing in a strong puritanical stream,</p>

<p>had suddenly found a way open in the direction of you, and had all at</p>

<p>once gushed through.  The religious channel is left dry forthwith;</p>

<p>and it is you who have done it!"</p>

<p>She gazed in silence.</p>

<p>"What--you have given up your preaching entirely?" she asked.  She</p>

<p>had gathered from Angel sufficient of the incredulity of modern</p>

<p>thought to despise flash enthusiasm; but, as a woman, she was</p>

<p>somewhat appalled.</p>

<p>In affected severity d'Urberville continued--</p>

<p>"Entirely.  I have broken every engagement since that afternoon I was</p>

<p>to address the drunkards at Casterbridge Fair.  The deuce only knows</p>

<p>what I am thought of by the brethren.  Ah-ha!  The brethren!  No</p>

<p>doubt they pray for me--weep for me; for they are kind people in</p>

<p>their way.  But what do I care?  How could I go on with the thing</p>

<p>when I had lost my faith in it?--it would have been hypocrisy of</p>

<p>the basest kind!  Among them I should have stood like Hymenaeus and</p>

<p>Alexander, who were delivered over to Satan that they might learn</p>

<p>not to blaspheme.  What a grand revenge you have taken!  I saw you</p>

<p>innocent, and I deceived you.  Four years after, you find me a</p>

<p>Christian enthusiast; you then work upon me, perhaps to my complete</p>

<p>perdition!  But Tess, my coz, as I used to call you, this is only</p>

<p>my way of talking, and you must not look so horribly concerned.</p>

<p>Of course you have done nothing except retain your pretty face and</p>

<p>shapely figure.  I saw it on the rick before you saw me--that tight</p>

<p>pinafore-thing sets it off, and that wing-bonnet--you field-girls</p>

<p>should never wear those bonnets if you wish to keep out of danger."</p>

<p>He regarded her silently for a few moments, and with a short cynical</p>

<p>laugh resumed: "I believe that if the bachelor-apostle, whose deputy</p>

<p>I thought I was, had been tempted by such a pretty face, he would</p>

<p>have let go the plough for her sake as I do!"</p>

<p>Tess attempted to expostulate, but at this juncture all her fluency</p>

<p>failed her, and without heeding he added:</p>

<p>"Well, this paradise that you supply is perhaps as good as any other,</p>

<p>after all.  But to speak seriously, Tess."  D'Urberville rose and</p>

<p>came nearer, reclining sideways amid the sheaves, and resting upon</p>

<p>his elbow.  "Since I last saw you, I have been thinking of what</p>

<p>you said that HE said.  I have come to the conclusion that there</p>

<p>does seem rather a want of common-sense in these threadbare old</p>

<p>propositions; how I could have been so fired by poor Parson Clare's</p>

<p>enthusiasm, and have gone so madly to work, transcending even him, I</p>

<p>cannot make out!  As for what you said last time, on the strength of</p>

<p>your wonderful husband's intelligence--whose name you have never told</p>

<p>me--about having what they call an ethical system without any dogma,</p>

<p>I don't see my way to that at all."</p>

<p>"Why, you can have the religion of loving-kindness and purity at</p>

<p>least, if you can't have--what do you call it--dogma."</p>

<p>"O no!  I'm a different sort of fellow from that!  If there's nobody</p>

<p>to say, 'Do this, and it will be a good thing for you after you are</p>

<p>dead; do that, and if will be a bad thing for you,' I can't warm up.</p>

<p>Hang it, I am not going to feel responsible for my deeds and passions</p>

<p>if there's nobody to be responsible to; and if I were you, my dear,</p>

<p>I wouldn't either!"</p>

<p>She tried to argue, and tell him that he had mixed in his dull</p>

<p>brain two matters, theology and morals, which in the primitive days</p>

<p>of mankind had been quite distinct.  But owing to Angel Clare's</p>

<p>reticence, to her absolute want of training, and to her being a</p>

<p>vessel of emotions rather than reasons, she could not get on.</p>

<p>"Well, never mind," he resumed.  "Here I am, my love, as in the old</p>

<p>times!"</p>

<p>"Not as then--never as then--'tis different!" she entreated.  "And</p>

<p>there was never warmth with me!  O why didn't you keep your faith,</p>

<p>if the loss of it has brought you to speak to me like this!"</p>

<p>"Because you've knocked it out of me; so the evil be upon your sweet</p>

<p>head!  Your husband little thought how his teaching would recoil upon</p>

<p>him!  Ha-ha--I'm awfully glad you have made an apostate of me all the</p>

<p>same!  Tess, I am more taken with you than ever, and I pity you too.</p>

<p>For all your closeness, I see you are in a bad way--neglected by one</p>

<p>who ought to cherish you."</p>

<p>She could not get her morsels of food down her throat; her lips</p>

<p>were dry, and she was ready to choke.  The voices and laughs of the</p>

<p>workfolk eating and drinking under the rick came to her as if they</p>

<p>were a quarter of a mile off.</p>

<p>"It is cruelty to me!" she said.  "How--how can you treat me to this</p>

<p>talk, if you care ever so little for me?"</p>

<p>"True, true," he said, wincing a little.  "I did not come to reproach</p>

<p>you for my deeds.  I came Tess, to say that I don't like you to be</p>

<p>working like this, and I have come on purpose for you.  You say you</p>

<p>have a husband who is not I.  Well, perhaps you have; but I've never</p>

<p>seen him, and you've not told me his name; and altogether he seems</p>

<p>rather a mythological personage.  However, even if you have one, I</p>

<p>think I am nearer to you than he is.  I, at any rate, try to help you</p>

<p>out of trouble, but he does not, bless his invisible face!  The words</p>

<p>of the stern prophet Hosea that I used to read come back to me.</p>

<p>Don't you know them, Tess?--'And she shall follow after her lover,</p>

<p>but she shall not overtake him; and she shall seek him, but shall</p>

<p>not find him; then shall she say, I will go and return to my first</p>

<p>husband; for then was it better with me than now!' ...  Tess, my trap</p>

<p>is waiting just under the hill, and--darling mine, not his!--you know</p>

<p>the rest."</p>

<p>Her face had been rising to a dull crimson fire while he spoke; but</p>

<p>she did not answer.</p>

<p>"You have been the cause of my backsliding," he continued, stretching</p>

<p>his arm towards her waist; "you should be willing to share it, and</p>

<p>leave that mule you call husband for ever."</p>

<p>One of her leather gloves, which she had taken off to eat her</p>

<p>skimmer-cake, lay in her lap, and without the slightest warning she</p>

<p>passionately swung the glove by the gauntlet directly in his face.</p>

<p>It was heavy and thick as a warrior's, and it struck him flat on the</p>

<p>mouth.  Fancy might have regarded the act as the recrudescence of</p>

<p>a trick in which her armed progenitors were not unpractised.  Alec</p>

<p>fiercely started up from his reclining position.  A scarlet oozing</p>

<p>appeared where her blow had alighted, and in a moment the blood began</p>

<p>dropping from his mouth upon the straw.  But he soon controlled</p>

<p>himself, calmly drew his handkerchief from his pocket, and mopped</p>

<p>his bleeding lips.</p>

<p>She too had sprung up, but she sank down again. "Now, punish me!" she</p>

<p>said, turning up her eyes to him with the hopeless defiance of the</p>

<p>sparrow's gaze before its captor twists its neck.  "Whip me, crush</p>

<p>me; you need not mind those people under the rick!  I shall not cry</p>

<p>out.  Once victim, always victim--that's the law!"</p>

<p>"O no, no, Tess," he said blandly.  "I can make full allowance for</p>

<p>this.  Yet you most unjustly forget one thing, that I would have</p>

<p>married you if you had not put it out of my power to do so.  Did I</p>

<p>not ask you flatly to be my wife--hey?  Answer me."</p>

<p>"You did."</p>

<p>"And you cannot be.  But remember one thing!"  His voice hardened</p>

<p>as his temper got the better of him with the recollection of his</p>

<p>sincerity in asking her and her present ingratitude, and he stepped</p>

<p>across to her side and held her by the shoulders, so that she shook</p>

<p>under his grasp.  "Remember, my lady, I was your master once!  I will</p>

<p>be your master again.  If you are any man's wife you are mine!"</p>

<p>The threshers now began to stir below.</p>

<p>"So much for our quarrel," he said, letting her go.  "Now I shall</p>

<p>leave you, and shall come again for your answer during the afternoon.</p>

<p>You don't know me yet!  But I know you."</p>

<p>She had not spoken again, remaining as if stunned.  D'Urberville</p>

<p>retreated over the sheaves, and descended the ladder, while the</p>

<p>workers below rose and stretched their arms, and shook down the beer</p>

<p>they had drunk.  Then the threshing-machine started afresh; and amid</p>

<p>the renewed rustle of the straw Tess resumed her position by the</p>

<p>buzzing drum as one in a dream, untying sheaf after sheaf in endless</p>

<p>succession.</p>

<p>XLVIII</p>

<p>In the afternoon the farmer made it known that the rick was to be</p>

<p>finished that night, since there was a moon by which they could see</p>

<p>to work, and the man with the engine was engaged for another farm on</p>

<p>the morrow.  Hence the twanging and humming and rustling proceeded</p>

<p>with even less intermission than usual.</p>

<p>It was not till "nammet"-time, about three o-clock, that Tess raised</p>

<p>her eyes and gave a momentary glance round.  She felt but little</p>

<p>surprise at seeing that Alec d'Urberville had come back, and was</p>

<p>standing under the hedge by the gate.  He had seen her lift her</p>

<p>eyes, and waved his hand urbanely to her, while he blew her a kiss.</p>

<p>It meant that their quarrel was over.  Tess looked down again, and</p>

<p>carefully abstained from gazing in that direction.</p>

<p>Thus the afternoon dragged on.  The wheat-rick shrank lower, and the</p>

<p>straw-rick grew higher, and the corn-sacks were carted away.  At six</p>

<p>o'clock the wheat-rick was about shoulder-high from the ground.  But</p>

<p>the unthreshed sheaves remaining untouched seemed countless still,</p>

<p>notwithstanding the enormous numbers that had been gulped down by</p>

<p>the insatiable swallower, fed by the man and Tess, through whose two</p>

<p>young hands the greater part of them had passed.  And the immense</p>

<p>stack of straw where in the morning there had been nothing, appeared</p>

<p>as the faeces of the same buzzing red glutton.  From the west sky</p>

<p>a wrathful shine--all that wild March could afford in the way of</p>

<p>sunset--had burst forth after the cloudy day, flooding the tired and</p>

<p>sticky faces of the threshers, and dyeing them with a coppery light,</p>

<p>as also the flapping garments of the women, which clung to them like</p>

<p>dull flames.</p>

<p>A panting ache ran through the rick.  The man who fed was weary, and</p>

<p>Tess could see that the red nape of his neck was encrusted with dirt</p>

<p>and husks.  She still stood at her post, her flushed and perspiring</p>

<p>face coated with the corndust, and her white bonnet embrowned by it.</p>

<p>She was the only woman whose place was upon the machine so as to be</p>

<p>shaken bodily by its spinning, and the decrease of the stack now</p>

<p>separated her from Marian and Izz, and prevented their changing</p>

<p>duties with her as they had done.  The incessant quivering, in</p>

<p>which every fibre of her frame participated, had thrown her into a</p>

<p>stupefied reverie in which her arms worked on independently of her</p>

<p>consciousness.  She hardly knew where she was, and did not hear Izz</p>

<p>Huett tell her from below that her hair was tumbling down.</p>

<p>By degrees the freshest among them began to grow cadaverous and</p>

<p>saucer-eyed.  Whenever Tess lifted her head she beheld always the</p>

<p>great upgrown straw-stack, with the men in shirt-sleeves upon it,</p>

<p>against the gray north sky; in front of it the long red elevator</p>

<p>like a Jacob's ladder, on which a perpetual stream of threshed straw</p>

<p>ascended, a yellow river running uphill, and spouting out on the top</p>

<p>of the rick.</p>

<p>She knew that Alec d'Urberville was still on the scene, observing</p>

<p>her from some point or other, though she could not say where.  There</p>

<p>was an excuse for his remaining, for when the threshed rick drew</p>

<p>near its final sheaves a little ratting was always done, and men</p>

<p>unconnected with the threshing sometimes dropped in for that</p>

<p>performance--sporting characters of all descriptions, gents with</p>

<p>terriers and facetious pipes, roughs with sticks and stones.</p>

<p>But there was another hour's work before the layer of live rats at</p>

<p>the base of the stack would be reached; and as the evening light in</p>

<p>the direction of the Giant's Hill by Abbot's-Cernel dissolved away,</p>

<p>the white-faced moon of the season arose from the horizon that lay</p>

<p>towards Middleton Abbey and Shottsford on the other side.  For the</p>

<p>last hour or two Marian had felt uneasy about Tess, whom she could</p>

<p>not get near enough to speak to, the other women having kept up their</p>

<p>strength by drinking ale, and Tess having done without it through</p>

<p>traditionary dread, owing to its results at her home in childhood.</p>

<p>But Tess still kept going: if she could not fill her part she would</p>

<p>have to leave; and this contingency, which she would have regarded</p>

<p>with equanimity and even with relief a month or two earlier, had</p>

<p>become a terror since d'Urberville had begun to hover round her.</p>

<p>The sheaf-pitchers and feeders had now worked the rick so low that</p>

<p>people on the ground could talk to them.  To Tess's surprise Farmer</p>

<p>Groby came up on the machine to her, and said that if she desired to</p>

<p>join her friend he did not wish her to keep on any longer, and would</p>

<p>send somebody else to take her place.  The "friend" was d'Urberville,</p>

<p>she knew, and also that this concession had been granted in obedience</p>

<p>to the request of that friend, or enemy.  She shook her head and</p>

<p>toiled on.</p>

<p>The time for the rat-catching arrived at last, and the hunt began.</p>

<p>The creatures had crept downwards with the subsidence of the rick</p>

<p>till they were all together at the bottom, and being now uncovered</p>

<p>from their last refuge, they ran across the open ground in all</p>

<p>directions, a loud shriek from the by-this-time half-tipsy Marian</p>

<p>informing her companions that one of the rats had invaded her</p>

<p>person--a terror which the rest of the women had guarded against by</p>

<p>various schemes of skirt-tucking and self-elevation.  The rat was</p>

<p>at last dislodged, and, amid the barking of dogs, masculine shouts,</p>

<p>feminine screams, oaths, stampings, and confusion as of Pandemonium,</p>

<p>Tess untied her last sheaf; the drum slowed, the whizzing ceased,</p>

<p>and she stepped from the machine to the ground.</p>

<p>Her lover, who had only looked on at the rat-catching, was promptly</p>

<p>at her side.</p>

<p>"What--after all--my insulting slap, too!" said she in an</p>

<p>underbreath.  She was so utterly exhausted that she had not strength</p>

<p>to speak louder.</p>

<p>"I should indeed be foolish to feel offended at anything you say or</p>

<p>do," he answered, in the seductive voice of the Trantridge time.</p>

<p>"How the little limbs tremble!  You are as weak as a bled calf, you</p>

<p>know you are; and yet you need have done nothing since I arrived.</p>

<p>How could you be so obstinate?  However, I have told the farmer that</p>

<p>he has no right to employ women at steam-threshing.  It is not proper</p>

<p>work for them; and on all the better class of farms it has been given</p>

<p>up, as he knows very well.  I will walk with you as far as your</p>

<p>home."</p>

<p>"O yes," she answered with a jaded gait.  "Walk wi' me if you will!</p>

<p>I do bear in mind that you came to marry me before you knew o' my</p>

<p>state.  Perhaps--perhaps you are a little better and kinder than I</p>

<p>have been thinking you were.  Whatever is meant as kindness I am</p>

<p>grateful for; whatever is meant in any other way I am angered at.</p>

<p>I cannot sense your meaning sometimes."</p>

<p>"If I cannot legitimize our former relations at least I can assist</p>

<p>you.  And I will do it with much more regard for your feelings than</p>

<p>I formerly showed.  My religious mania, or whatever it was, is over.</p>

<p>But I retain a little good nature; I hope I do.  Now, Tess, by</p>

<p>all that's tender and strong between man and woman, trust me!  I</p>

<p>have enough and more than enough to put you out of anxiety, both</p>

<p>for yourself and your parents and sisters.  I can make them all</p>

<p>comfortable if you will only show confidence in me."</p>

<p>"Have you seen 'em lately?" she quickly inquired.</p>

<p>"Yes.  They didn't know where you were.  It was only by chance that I</p>

<p>found you here."</p>

<p>The cold moon looked aslant upon Tess's fagged face between the twigs</p>

<p>of the garden-hedge as she paused outside the cottage which was her</p>

<p>temporary home, d'Urberville pausing beside her.</p>

<p>"Don't mention my little brothers and sisters--don't make me break</p>

<p>down quite!" she said.  "If you want to help them--God knows they</p>

<p>need it--do it without telling me.  But no, no!" she cried.  "I will</p>

<p>take nothing from you, either for them or for me!"</p>

<p>He did not accompany her further, since, as she lived with the</p>

<p>household, all was public indoors.  No sooner had she herself</p>

<p>entered, laved herself in a washing-tub, and shared supper with the</p>

<p>family than she fell into thought, and withdrawing to the table under</p>

<p>the wall, by the light of her own little lamp wrote in a passionate</p>

<p>mood--</p>

<p>   MY OWN HUSBAND,--</p>

<p>   Let me call you so--I must--even if it makes you angry to</p>

<p>   think of such an unworthy wife as I.  I must cry to you</p>

<p>   in my trouble--I have no one else!  I am so exposed to</p>

<p>   temptation, Angel.  I fear to say who it is, and I do not</p>

<p>   like to write about it at all.  But I cling to you in a way</p>

<p>   you cannot think!  Can you not come to me now, at once,</p>

<p>   before anything terrible happens?  O, I know you cannot,</p>

<p>   because you are so far away!  I think I must die if you do</p>

<p>   not come soon, or tell me to come to you.  The punishment</p>

<p>   you have measured out to me is deserved--I do know that--</p>

<p>   well deserved--and you are right and just to be angry with</p>

<p>   me.  But, Angel, please, please, not to be just--only a</p>

<p>   little kind to me, even if I do not deserve it, and come to</p>

<p>   me!  If you would come, I could die in your arms!  I would</p>

<p>   be well content to do that if so be you had forgiven me!</p>

<p>   Angel, I live entirely for you.  I love you too much to</p>

<p>   blame you for going away, and I know it was necessary you</p>

<p>   should find a farm.  Do not think I shall say a word of</p>

<p>   sting or bitterness.  Only come back to me.  I am desolate</p>

<p>   without you, my darling, O, so desolate! I do not mind</p>

<p>   having to work: but if you will send me one little line,</p>

<p>   and say, "I am coming soon," I will bide on, Angel--O, so</p>

<p>   cheerfully!</p>

<p>   It has been so much my religion ever since we were married</p>

<p>   to be faithful to you in every thought and look, that even</p>

<p>   when a man speaks a compliment to me before I am aware, it</p>

<p>   seems wronging you.  Have you never felt one little bit of</p>

<p>   what you used to feel when we were at the dairy?  If you</p>

<p>   have, how can you keep away from me?  I am the same women,</p>

<p>   Angel, as you fell in love with; yes, the very same!--not</p>

<p>   the one you disliked but never saw.  What was the past to me</p>

<p>   as soon as I met you?  It was a dead thing altogether.  I</p>

<p>   became another woman, filled full of new life from you.  How</p>

<p>   could I be the early one?  Why do you not see this?  Dear,</p>

<p>   if you would only be a little more conceited, and believe</p>

<p>   in yourself so far as to see that you were strong enough to</p>

<p>   work this change in me, you would perhaps be in a mind to</p>

<p>   come to me, your poor wife.</p>

<p>   How silly I was in my happiness when I thought I could trust</p>

<p>   you always to love me!  I ought to have known that such as</p>

<p>   that was not for poor me.  But I am sick at heart, not only</p>

<p>   for old times, but for the present.  Think--think how it do</p>

<p>   hurt my heart not to see you ever--ever!  Ah, if I could</p>

<p>   only make your dear heart ache one little minute of each day</p>

<p>   as mine does every day and all day long, it might lead you</p>

<p>   to show pity to your poor lonely one.</p>

<p>   People still say that I am rather pretty, Angel (handsome is</p>

<p>   the word they use, since I wish to be truthful).  Perhaps I</p>

<p>   am what they say.  But I do not value my good looks; I only</p>

<p>   like to have them because they belong to you, my dear, and</p>

<p>   that there may be at least one thing about me worth your</p>

<p>   having.  So much have I felt this, that when I met with</p>

<p>   annoyance on account of the same, I tied up my face in a</p>

<p>   bandage as long as people would believe in it.  O Angel, I</p>

<p>   tell you all this not from vanity--you will certainly know</p>

<p>   I do not--but only that you may come to me!</p>

<p>   If you really cannot come to me, will you let me come to</p>

<p>   you?  I am, as I say, worried, pressed to do what I will</p>

<p>   not do.  It cannot be that I shall yield one inch, yet I am</p>

<p>   in terror as to what an accident might lead to, and I so</p>

<p>   defenceless on account of my first error. I cannot say more</p>

<p>   about this--it makes me too miserable.  But if I break down</p>

<p>   by falling into some fearful snare, my last state will be</p>

<p>   worse than my first.  O God, I cannot think of it!  Let me</p>

<p>   come at once, or at once come to me!</p>

<p>   I would be content, ay, glad, to live with you as your</p>

<p>   servant, if I may not as your wife; so that I could only be</p>

<p>   near you, and get glimpses of you, and think of you as mine.</p>

<p>   The daylight has nothing to show me, since you are not here,</p>

<p>   and I don't like to see the rooks and starlings in the</p>

<p>   field, because I grieve and grieve to miss you who used to</p>

<p>   see them with me.  I long for only one thing in heaven or</p>

<p>   earth or under the earth, to meet you, my own dear!  Come</p>

<p>   to me--come to me, and save me from what threatens me!--</p>

<p>   Your faithful heartbroken</p>

<p>   TESS</p>

<p>XLIX</p>

<p>The appeal duly found its way to the breakfast-table of the quiet</p>

<p>Vicarage to the westward, in that valley where the air is so soft and</p>

<p>the soil so rich that the effort of growth requires but superficial</p>

<p>aid by comparison with the tillage at Flintcomb-Ash, and where to</p>

<p>Tess the human world seemed so different (though it was much the</p>

<p>same).  It was purely for security that she had been requested by</p>

<p>Angel to send her communications through his father, whom he kept</p>

<p>pretty well informed of his changing addresses in the country he</p>

<p>had gone to exploit for himself with a heavy heart.</p>

<p>"Now," said old Mr Clare to his wife, when he had read the envelope,</p>

<p>"if Angel proposes leaving Rio for a visit home at the end of next</p>

<p>month, as he told us that he hoped to do, I think this may hasten his</p>

<p>plans; for I believe it to be from his wife."  He breathed deeply at</p>

<p>the thought of her; and the letter was redirected to be promptly sent</p>

<p>on to Angel.</p>

<p>"Dear fellow, I hope he will get home safely," murmured Mrs Clare.</p>

<p>"To my dying day I shall feel that he has been ill-used.  You should</p>

<p>have sent him to Cambridge in spite of his want of faith and given</p>

<p>him the same chance as the other boys had.  He would have grown out</p>

<p>of it under proper influence, and perhaps would have taken Orders</p>

<p>after all.  Church or no Church, it would have been fairer to him."</p>

<p>This was the only wail with which Mrs Clare ever disturbed her</p>

<p>husband's peace in respect to their sons.  And she did not vent this</p>

<p>often; for she was as considerate as she was devout, and knew that</p>

<p>his mind too was troubled by doubts as to his justice in this matter.</p>

<p>Only too often had she heard him lying awake at night, stifling sighs</p>

<p>for Angel with prayers.  But the uncompromising Evangelical did not</p>

<p>even now hold that he would have been justified in giving his son,</p>

<p>an unbeliever, the same academic advantages that he had given to the</p>

<p>two others, when it was possible, if not probable, that those very</p>

<p>advantages might have been used to decry the doctrines which he had</p>

<p>made it his life's mission and desire to propagate, and the mission</p>

<p>of his ordained sons likewise.  To put with one hand a pedestal</p>

<p>under the feet of the two faithful ones, and with the other to exalt</p>

<p>the unfaithful by the same artificial means, he deemed to be alike</p>

<p>inconsistent with his convictions, his position, and his hopes.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, he loved his misnamed Angel, and in secret mourned</p>

<p>over this treatment of him as Abraham might have mourned over the</p>

<p>doomed Isaac while they went up the hill together.  His silent</p>

<p>self-generated regrets were far bitterer than the reproaches which</p>

<p>his wife rendered audible.</p>

<p>They blamed themselves for this unlucky marriage.  If Angel had never</p>

<p>been destined for a farmer he would never have been thrown with</p>

<p>agricultural girls.  They did not distinctly know what had separated</p>

<p>him and his wife, nor the date on which the separation had taken</p>

<p>place.  At first they had supposed it must be something of the nature</p>

<p>of a serious aversion.  But in his later letters he occasionally</p>

<p>alluded to the intention of coming home to fetch her; from which</p>

<p>expressions they hoped the division might not owe its origin to</p>

<p>anything so hopelessly permanent as that.  He had told them that she</p>

<p>was with her relatives, and in their doubts they had decided not to</p>

<p>intrude into a situation which they knew no way of bettering.</p>

<p>The eyes for which Tess's letter was intended were gazing at this</p>

<p>time on a limitless expanse of country from the back of a mule which</p>

<p>was bearing him from the interior of the South-American Continent</p>

<p>towards the coast.  His experiences of this strange land had been</p>

<p>sad.  The severe illness from which he had suffered shortly after</p>

<p>his arrival had never wholly left him, and he had by degrees almost</p>

<p>decided to relinquish his hope of farming here, though, as long as</p>

<p>the bare possibility existed of his remaining, he kept this change</p>

<p>of view a secret from his parents.</p>

<p>The crowds of agricultural labourers who had come out to the country</p>

<p>in his wake, dazzled by representations of easy independence, had</p>

<p>suffered, died, and wasted away.  He would see mothers from English</p>

<p>farms trudging along with their infants in their arms, when the child</p>

<p>would be stricken with fever and would die; the mother would pause</p>

<p>to dig a hole in the loose earth with her bare hands, would bury the</p>

<p>babe therein with the same natural grave-tools, shed one tear, and</p>

<p>again trudge on.</p>

<p>Angel's original intention had not been emigration to Brazil but a</p>

<p>northern or eastern farm in his own country.  He had come to this</p>

<p>place in a fit of desperation, the Brazil movement among the English</p>

<p>agriculturists having by chance coincided with his desire to escape</p>

<p>from his past existence.</p>

<p>During this time of absence he had mentally aged a dozen years.</p>

<p>What arrested him now as of value in life was less its beauty than</p>

<p>its pathos.  Having long discredited the old systems of mysticism,</p>

<p>he now began to discredit the old appraisements of morality.  He</p>

<p>thought they wanted readjusting.  Who was the moral man?  Still more</p>

<p>pertinently, who was the moral woman?  The beauty or ugliness of</p>

<p>a character lay not only in its achievements, but in its aims and</p>

<p>impulses; its true history lay, not among things done, but among</p>

<p>things willed.</p>

<p>How, then, about Tess?</p>

<p>Viewing her in these lights, a regret for his hasty judgement began</p>

<p>to oppress him.  Did he reject her eternally, or did he not?  He</p>

<p>could no longer say that he would always reject her, and not to say</p>

<p>that was in spirit to accept her now.</p>

<p>This growing fondness for her memory coincided in point of time</p>

<p>with her residence at Flintcomb-Ash, but it was before she had felt</p>

<p>herself at liberty to trouble him with a word about her circumstances</p>

<p>or her feelings.  He was greatly perplexed; and in his perplexity as</p>

<p>to her motives in withholding intelligence, he did not inquire.  Thus</p>

<p>her silence of docility was misinterpreted.  How much it really said</p>

<p>if he had understood!--that she adhered with literal exactness to</p>

<p>orders which he had given and forgotten; that despite her natural</p>

<p>fearlessness she asserted no rights, admitted his judgement to be in</p>

<p>every respect the true one, and bent her head dumbly thereto.</p>

<p>In the before-mentioned journey by mules through the interior of the</p>

<p>country, another man rode beside him. Angel's companion was also an</p>

<p>Englishman, bent on the same errand, though he came from another part</p>

<p>of the island.  They were both in a state of mental depression, and</p>

<p>they spoke of home affairs.  Confidence begat confidence.  With that</p>

<p>curious tendency evinced by men, more especially when in distant</p>

<p>lands, to entrust to strangers details of their lives which they</p>

<p>would on no account mention to friends, Angel admitted to this man</p>

<p>as they rode along the sorrowful facts of his marriage.</p>

<p>The stranger had sojourned in many more lands and among many more</p>

<p>peoples than Angel; to his cosmopolitan mind such deviations from the</p>

<p>social norm, so immense to domesticity, were no more than are the</p>

<p>irregularities of vale and mountain-chain to the whole terrestrial</p>

<p>curve.  He viewed the matter in quite a different light from Angel;</p>

<p>thought that what Tess had been was of no importance beside what she</p>

<p>would be, and plainly told Clare that he was wrong in coming away</p>

<p>from her.</p>

<p>The next day they were drenched in a thunder-storm. Angel's companion</p>

<p>was struck down with fever, and died by the week's end.  Clare waited</p>

<p>a few hours to bury him, and then went on his way.</p>

<p>The cursory remarks of the large-minded stranger, of whom he knew</p>

<p>absolutely nothing beyond a commonplace name, were sublimed by his</p>

<p>death, and influenced Clare more than all the reasoned ethics of the</p>

<p>philosophers.  His own parochialism made him ashamed by its contrast.</p>

<p>His inconsistencies rushed upon him in a flood.  He had persistently</p>

<p>elevated Hellenic Paganism at the expense of Christianity; yet in</p>

<p>that civilization an illegal surrender was not certain disesteem.</p>

<p>Surely then he might have regarded that abhorrence of the un-intact</p>

<p>state, which he had inherited with the creed of mysticism, as at</p>

<p>least open to correction when the result was due to treachery.  A</p>

<p>remorse struck into him.  The words of Izz Huett, never quite stilled</p>

<p>in his memory, came back to him.  He had asked Izz if she loved him,</p>

<p>and she had replied in the affirmative.  Did she love him more than</p>

<p>Tess did?  No, she had replied; Tess would lay down her life for him,</p>

<p>and she herself could do no more.</p>

<p>He thought of Tess as she had appeared on the day of the wedding.</p>

<p>How her eyes had lingered upon him; how she had hung upon his words</p>

<p>as if they were a god's!  And during the terrible evening over the</p>

<p>hearth, when her simple soul uncovered itself to his, how pitiful her</p>

<p>face had looked by the rays of the fire, in her inability to realize</p>

<p>that his love and protection could possibly be withdrawn.</p>

<p>Thus from being her critic he grew to be her advocate.  Cynical</p>

<p>things he had uttered to himself about her; but no man can be always</p>

<p>a cynic and live; and he withdrew them.  The mistake of expressing</p>

<p>them had arisen from his allowing himself to be influenced by general</p>

<p>principles to the disregard of the particular instance.</p>

<p>But the reasoning is somewhat musty; lovers and husbands have gone</p>

<p>over the ground before to-day.  Clare had been harsh towards her;</p>

<p>there is no doubt of it.  Men are too often harsh with women they</p>

<p>love or have loved; women with men.  And yet these harshnesses are</p>

<p>tenderness itself when compared with the universal harshness out</p>

<p>of which they grow; the harshness of the position towards the</p>

<p>temperament, of the means towards the aims, of to-day towards</p>

<p>yesterday, of hereafter towards to-day.</p>

<p>The historic interest of her family--that masterful line of</p>

<p>d'Urbervilles--whom he had despised as a spent force, touched his</p>

<p>sentiments now.  Why had he not known the difference between the</p>

<p>political value and the imaginative value of these things?  In</p>

<p>the latter aspect her d'Urberville descent was a fact of great</p>

<p>dimensions; worthless to economics, it was a most useful ingredient</p>

<p>to the dreamer, to the moralizer on declines and falls.  It was a</p>

<p>fact that would soon be forgotten--that bit of distinction in poor</p>

<p>Tess's blood and name, and oblivion would fall upon her hereditary</p>

<p>link with the marble monuments and leaded skeletons at Kingsbere.  So</p>

<p>does Time ruthlessly destroy his own romances.  In recalling her face</p>

<p>again and again, he thought now that he could see therein a flash of</p>

<p>the dignity which must have graced her grand-dames; and the vision</p>

<p>sent that _aura_ through his veins which he had formerly felt, and</p>

<p>which left behind it a sense of sickness.</p>

<p>Despite her not-inviolate past, what still abode in such a woman as</p>

<p>Tess outvalued the freshness of her fellows.  Was not the gleaning</p>

<p>of the grapes of Ephraim better than the vintage of Abiezer?</p>

<p>So spoke love renascent, preparing the way for Tess's devoted</p>

<p>outpouring, which was then just being forwarded to him by his father;</p>

<p>though owing to his distance inland it was to be a long time in</p>

<p>reaching him.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the writer's expectation that Angel would come in response</p>

<p>to the entreaty was alternately great and small.  What lessened it</p>

<p>was that the facts of her life which had led to the parting had</p>

<p>not changed--could never change; and that, if her presence had not</p>

<p>attenuated them, her absence could not.  Nevertheless she addressed</p>

<p>her mind to the tender question of what she could do to please him</p>

<p>best if he should arrive.  Sighs were expended on the wish that she</p>

<p>had taken more notice of the tunes he played on his harp, that she</p>

<p>had inquired more curiously of him which were his favourite ballads</p>

<p>among those the country-girls sang.  She indirectly inquired of Amby</p>

<p>Seedling, who had followed Izz from Talbothays, and by chance Amby</p>

<p>remembered that, amongst the snatches of melody in which they had</p>

<p>indulged at the dairyman's, to induce the cows to let down their</p>

<p>milk, Clare had seemed to like "Cupid's Gardens", "I have parks, I</p>

<p>have hounds", and "The break o' the day"; and had seemed not to care</p>

<p>for "The Tailor's Breeches" and "Such a beauty I did grow", excellent</p>

<p>ditties as they were.</p>

<p>To perfect the ballads was now her whimsical desire. She practised</p>

<p>them privately at odd moments, especially "The break o' the day":</p>

<p>   Arise, arise, arise!</p>

<p>   And pick your love a posy,</p>

<p>   All o' the sweetest flowers</p>

<p>   That in the garden grow.</p>

<p>   The turtle doves and sma' birds</p>

<p>   In every bough a-building,</p>

<p>   So early in the May-time</p>

<p>   At the break o' the day!</p>

<p>It would have melted the heart of a stone to hear her singing these</p>

<p>ditties whenever she worked apart from the rest of the girls in this</p>

<p>cold dry time; the tears running down her cheeks all the while at the</p>

<p>thought that perhaps he would not, after all, come to hear her, and</p>

<p>the simple silly words of the songs resounding in painful mockery of</p>

<p>the aching heart of the singer.</p>

<p>Tess was so wrapt up in this fanciful dream that she seemed not to</p>

<p>know how the season was advancing; that the days had lengthened, that</p>

<p>Lady-Day was at hand, and would soon be followed by Old Lady-Day, the</p>

<p>end of her term here.</p>

<p>But before the quarter-day had quite come, something happened which</p>

<p>made Tess think of far different matters.  She was at her lodging as</p>

<p>usual one evening, sitting in the downstairs room with the rest of</p>

<p>the family, when somebody knocked at the door and inquired for Tess.</p>

<p>Through the doorway she saw against the declining light a figure</p>

<p>with the height of a woman and the breadth of a child, a tall, thin,</p>

<p>girlish creature whom she did not recognize in the twilight till the</p>

<p>girl said "Tess!"</p>

<p>"What--is it 'Liza-Lu?" asked Tess, in startled accents.  Her sister,</p>

<p>whom a little over a year ago she had left at home as a child, had</p>

<p>sprung up by a sudden shoot to a form of this presentation, of which</p>

<p>as yet Lu seemed herself scarce able to understand the meaning.</p>

<p>Her thin legs, visible below her once-long frock, now short by her</p>

<p>growing, and her uncomfortable hands and arms revealed her youth and</p>

<p>inexperience.</p>

<p>"Yes, I have been traipsing about all day, Tess," said Lu, with</p>

<p>unemotional gravity, "a-trying to find 'ee; and I'm very tired."</p>

<p>"What is the matter at home?"</p>

<p>"Mother is took very bad, and the doctor says she's dying, and as</p>

<p>father is not very well neither, and says 'tis wrong for a man of</p>

<p>such a high family as his to slave and drave at common labouring</p>

<p>work, we don't know what to do."</p>

<p>Tess stood in reverie a long time before she thought of asking</p>

<p>'Liza-Lu to come in and sit down.  When she had done so, and 'Liza-Lu</p>

<p>was having some tea, she came to a decision.  It was imperative that</p>

<p>she should go home.  Her agreement did not end till Old Lady-Day, the</p>

<p>sixth of April, but as the interval thereto was not a long one she</p>

<p>resolved to run the risk of starting at once.</p>

<p>To go that night would be a gain of twelve-hours; but her sister</p>

<p>was too tired to undertake such a distance till the morrow.  Tess</p>

<p>ran down to where Marian and Izz lived, informed them of what had</p>

<p>happened, and begged them to make the best of her case to the farmer.</p>

<p>Returning, she got Lu a supper, and after that, having tucked the</p>

<p>younger into her own bed, packed up as many of her belongings as</p>

<p>would go into a withy basket, and started, directing Lu to follow</p>

<p>her next morning.</p>

<p>L</p>

<p>She plunged into the chilly equinoctial darkness as the clock struck</p>

<p>ten, for her fifteen miles' walk under the steely stars.  In lonely</p>

<p>districts night is a protection rather than a danger to a noiseless</p>

<p>pedestrian, and knowing this, Tess pursued the nearest course along</p>

<p>by-lanes that she would almost have feared in the day-time; but</p>

<p>marauders were wanting now, and spectral fears were driven out of</p>

<p>her mind by thoughts of her mother.  Thus she proceeded mile after</p>

<p>mile, ascending and descending till she came to Bulbarrow, and about</p>

<p>midnight looked from that height into the abyss of chaotic shade</p>

<p>which was all that revealed itself of the vale on whose further side</p>

<p>she was born.  Having already traversed about five miles on the</p>

<p>upland, she had now some ten or eleven in the lowland before her</p>

<p>journey would be finished.  The winding road downwards became just</p>

<p>visible to her under the wan starlight as she followed it, and</p>

<p>soon she paced a soil so contrasting with that above it that the</p>

<p>difference was perceptible to the tread and to the smell.  It was the</p>

<p>heavy clay land of Blackmoor Vale, and a part of the Vale to which</p>

<p>turnpike-roads had never penetrated.  Superstitions linger longest on</p>

<p>these heavy soils.  Having once been forest, at this shadowy time it</p>

<p>seemed to assert something of its old character, the far and the near</p>

<p>being blended, and every tree and tall hedge making the most of its</p>

<p>presence.  The harts that had been hunted here, the witches that had</p>

<p>been pricked and ducked, the green-spangled fairies that "whickered"</p>

<p>at you as you passed;--the place teemed with beliefs in them still,</p>

<p>and they formed an impish multitude now.</p>

<p>At Nuttlebury she passed the village inn, whose sign creaked in</p>

<p>response to the greeting of her footsteps, which not a human soul</p>

<p>heard but herself.  Under the thatched roofs her mind's eye beheld</p>

<p>relaxed tendons and flaccid muscles, spread out in the darkness</p>

<p>beneath coverlets made of little purple patchwork squares, and</p>

<p>undergoing a bracing process at the hands of sleep for renewed labour</p>

<p>on the morrow, as soon as a hint of pink nebulosity appeared on</p>

<p>Hambledon Hill.</p>

<p>At three she turned the last corner of the maze of lanes she had</p>

<p>threaded, and entered Marlott, passing the field in which as a</p>

<p>club-girl she had first seen Angel Clare, when he had not danced</p>

<p>with her; the sense of disappointment remained with her yet.  In the</p>

<p>direction of her mother's house she saw a light.  It came from the</p>

<p>bedroom window, and a branch waved in front of it and made it wink at</p>

<p>her.  As soon as she could discern the outline of the house--newly</p>

<p>thatched with her money--it had all its old effect upon Tess's</p>

<p>imagination.  Part of her body and life it ever seemed to be; the</p>

<p>slope of its dormers, the finish of its gables, the broken courses of</p>

<p>brick which topped the chimney, all had something in common with her</p>

<p>personal character.  A stupefaction had come into these features, to</p>

<p>her regard; it meant the illness of her mother.</p>

<p>She opened the door so softly as to disturb nobody; the lower room</p>

<p>was vacant, but the neighbour who was sitting up with her mother came</p>

<p>to the top of the stairs, and whispered that Mrs Durbeyfield was no</p>

<p>better, though she was sleeping just then.  Tess prepared herself a</p>

<p>breakfast, and then took her place as nurse in her mother's chamber.</p>

<p>In the morning, when she contemplated the children, they had all a</p>

<p>curiously elongated look; although she had been away little more than</p>

<p>a year, their growth was astounding; and the necessity of applying</p>

<p>herself heart and soul to their needs took her out of her own cares.</p>

<p>Her father's ill-health was the same indefinite kind, and he sat in</p>

<p>his chair as usual.  But the day after her arrival he was unusually</p>

<p>bright.  He had a rational scheme for living, and Tess asked him what</p>

<p>it was.</p>

<p>"I'm thinking of sending round to all the old antiqueerians in this</p>

<p>part of England," he said, "asking them to subscribe to a fund to</p>

<p>maintain me.  I'm sure they'd see it as a romantical, artistical,</p>

<p>and proper thing to do.  They spend lots o' money in keeping up old</p>

<p>ruins, and finding the bones o' things, and such like; and living</p>

<p>remains must be more interesting to 'em still, if they only knowed</p>

<p>of me.  Would that somebody would go round and tell 'em what there</p>

<p>is living among 'em, and they thinking nothing of him!  If Pa'son</p>

<p>Tringham, who discovered me, had lived, he'd ha' done it, I'm sure."</p>

<p>Tess postponed her arguments on this high project till she had</p>

<p>grappled with pressing matters in hand, which seemed little improved</p>

<p>by her remittances.  When indoor necessities had been eased, she</p>

<p>turned her attention to external things.  It was now the season for</p>

<p>planting and sowing; many gardens and allotments of the villagers</p>

<p>had already received their spring tillage; but the garden and the</p>

<p>allotment of the Durbeyfields were behindhand.  She found, to her</p>

<p>dismay, that this was owing to their having eaten all the seed</p>

<p>potatoes,--that last lapse of the improvident.  At the earliest</p>

<p>moment she obtained what others she could procure, and in a few</p>

<p>days her father was well enough to see to the garden, under Tess's</p>

<p>persuasive efforts: while she herself undertook the allotment-plot</p>

<p>which they rented in a field a couple of hundred yards out of the</p>

<p>village.</p>

<p>She liked doing it after the confinement of the sick chamber, where</p>

<p>she was not now required by reason of her mother's improvement.</p>

<p>Violent motion relieved thought.  The plot of ground was in a high,</p>

<p>dry, open enclosure, where there were forty or fifty such pieces,</p>

<p>and where labour was at its briskest when the hired labour of the</p>

<p>day had ended.  Digging began usually at six o'clock and extended</p>

<p>indefinitely into the dusk or moonlight.  Just now heaps of dead</p>

<p>weeds and refuse were burning on many of the plots, the dry weather</p>

<p>favouring their combustion.</p>

<p>One fine day Tess and 'Liza-Lu worked on here with their neighbours</p>

<p>till the last rays of the sun smote flat upon the white pegs that</p>

<p>divided the plots.  As soon as twilight succeeded to sunset the flare</p>

<p>of the couch-grass and cabbage-stalk fires began to light up the</p>

<p>allotments fitfully, their outlines appearing and disappearing under</p>

<p>the dense smoke as wafted by the wind.  When a fire glowed, banks</p>

<p>of smoke, blown level along the ground, would themselves become</p>

<p>illuminated to an opaque lustre, screening the workpeople from one</p>

<p>another; and the meaning of the "pillar of a cloud", which was a wall</p>

<p>by day and a light by night, could be understood.</p>

<p>As evening thickened, some of the gardening men and women gave over</p>

<p>for the night, but the greater number remained to get their planting</p>

<p>done, Tess being among them, though she sent her sister home.  It was</p>

<p>on one of the couch-burning plots that she laboured with her fork,</p>

<p>its four shining prongs resounding against the stones and dry clods</p>

<p>in little clicks.  Sometimes she was completely involved in the smoke</p>

<p>of her fire; then it would leave her figure free, irradiated by the</p>

<p>brassy glare from the heap.  She was oddly dressed to-night, and</p>

<p>presented a somewhat staring aspect, her attire being a gown bleached</p>

<p>by many washings, with a short black jacket over it, the effect of</p>

<p>the whole being that of a wedding and funeral guest in one.  The</p>

<p>women further back wore white aprons, which, with their pale faces,</p>

<p>were all that could be seen of them in the gloom, except when at</p>

<p>moments they caught a flash from the flames.</p>

<p>Westward, the wiry boughs of the bare thorn hedge which formed the</p>

<p>boundary of the field rose against the pale opalescence of the lower</p>

<p>sky.  Above, Jupiter hung like a full-blown jonquil, so bright</p>

<p>as almost to throw a shade.  A few small nondescript stars were</p>

<p>appearing elsewhere.  In the distance a dog barked, and wheels</p>

<p>occasionally rattled along the dry road.</p>

<p>Still the prongs continued to click assiduously, for it was not late;</p>

<p>and though the air was fresh and keen there was a whisper of spring</p>

<p>in it that cheered the workers on.  Something in the place, the</p>

<p>hours, the crackling fires, the fantastic mysteries of light and</p>

<p>shade, made others as well as Tess enjoy being there. Nightfall,</p>

<p>which in the frost of winter comes as a fiend and in the warmth of</p>

<p>summer as a lover, came as a tranquillizer on this March day.</p>

<p>Nobody looked at his or her companions.  The eyes of all were on the</p>

<p>soil as its turned surface was revealed by the fires.  Hence as Tess</p>

<p>stirred the clods and sang her foolish little songs with scarce</p>

<p>now a hope that Clare would ever hear them, she did not for a long</p>

<p>time notice the person who worked nearest to her--a man in a long</p>

<p>smockfrock who, she found, was forking the same plot as herself, and</p>

<p>whom she supposed her father had sent there to advance the work.</p>

<p>She became more conscious of him when the direction of his digging</p>

<p>brought him closer.  Sometimes the smoke divided them; then it</p>

<p>swerved, and the two were visible to each other but divided from all</p>

<p>the rest.</p>

<p>Tess did not speak to her fellow-worker, nor did he speak to her.</p>

<p>Nor did she think of him further than to recollect that he had not</p>

<p>been there when it was broad daylight, and that she did not know</p>

<p>him as any one of the Marlott labourers, which was no wonder, her</p>

<p>absences having been so long and frequent of late years.  By-and-by</p>

<p>he dug so close to her that the fire-beams were reflected as</p>

<p>distinctly from the steel prongs of his fork as from her own.  On</p>

<p>going up to the fire to throw a pitch of dead weeds upon it, she</p>

<p>found that he did the same on the other side. The fire flared up,</p>

<p>and she beheld the face of d'Urberville.</p>

<p>The unexpectedness of his presence, the grotesqueness of his</p>

<p>appearance in a gathered smockfrock, such as was now worn only by the</p>

<p>most old-fashioned of the labourers, had a ghastly comicality that</p>

<p>chilled her as to its bearing.  D'Urberville emitted a low, long</p>

<p>laugh.</p>

<p>"If I were inclined to joke, I should say, How much this seems like</p>

<p>Paradise!" he remarked whimsically, looking at her with an inclined</p>

<p>head.</p>

<p>"What do you say?" she weakly asked.</p>

<p>"A jester might say this is just like Paradise.  You are Eve, and I</p>

<p>am the old Other One come to tempt you in the disguise of an inferior</p>

<p>animal.  I used to be quite up in that scene of Milton's when I was</p>

<p>theological.  Some of it goes--</p>

<p>   "'Empress, the way is ready, and not long,</p>

<p>   Beyond a row of myrtles...</p>

<p>   ... If thou accept</p>

<p>   My conduct, I can bring thee thither soon.'</p>

<p>   'Lead then,' said Eve.</p>

<p>"And so on.  My dear Tess, I am only putting this to you as a thing</p>

<p>that you might have supposed or said quite untruly, because you think</p>

<p>so badly of me."</p>

<p>"I never said you were Satan, or thought it.  I don't think of you in</p>

<p>that way at all.  My thoughts of you are quite cold, except when you</p>

<p>affront me.  What, did you come digging here entirely because of me?"</p>

<p>"Entirely.  To see you; nothing more.  The smockfrock, which I</p>

<p>saw hanging for sale as I came along, was an afterthought, that I</p>

<p>mightn't be noticed.  I come to protest against your working like</p>

<p>this."</p>

<p>"But I like doing it--it is for my father."</p>

<p>"Your engagement at the other place is ended?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Where are you going to next?  To join your dear husband?"</p>

<p>She could not bear the humiliating reminder.</p>

<p>"O--I don't know!" she said bitterly.  "I have no husband!"</p>

<p>"It is quite true--in the sense you mean.  But you have a friend, and</p>

<p>I have determined that you shall be comfortable in spite of yourself.</p>

<p>When you get down to your house you will see what I have sent there</p>

<p>for you."</p>

<p>"O, Alec, I wish you wouldn't give me anything at all!  I cannot take</p>

<p>it from you!  I don't like--it is not right!"</p>

<p>"It IS right!" he cried lightly.  "I am not going to see a woman whom</p>

<p>I feel so tenderly for as I do for you in trouble without trying to</p>

<p>help her."</p>

<p>"But I am very well off!  I am only in trouble about--about--not</p>

<p>about living at all!"</p>

<p>She turned, and desperately resumed her digging, tears dripping upon</p>

<p>the fork-handle and upon the clods.</p>

<p>"About the children--your brothers and sisters," he resumed. "I've</p>

<p>been thinking of them."</p>

<p>Tess's heart quivered--he was touching her in a weak place.  He had</p>

<p>divined her chief anxiety.  Since returning home her soul had gone</p>

<p>out to those children with an affection that was passionate.</p>

<p>"If your mother does not recover, somebody ought to do something for</p>

<p>them; since your father will not be able to do much, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"He can with my assistance.  He must!"</p>

<p>"And with mine."</p>

<p>"No, sir!"</p>

<p>"How damned foolish this is!" burst out d'Urberville.  "Why, he</p>

<p>thinks we are the same family; and will be quite satisfied!"</p>

<p>"He don't.  I've undeceived him."</p>

<p>"The more fool you!"</p>

<p>D'Urberville in anger retreated from her to the hedge, where he</p>

<p>pulled off the long smockfrock which had disguised him; and rolling</p>

<p>it up and pushing it into the couch-fire, went away.</p>

<p>Tess could not get on with her digging after this; she felt restless;</p>

<p>she wondered if he had gone back to her father's house; and taking</p>

<p>the fork in her hand proceeded homewards.</p>

<p>Some twenty yards from the house she was met by one of her sisters.</p>

<p>"O, Tessy--what do you think!  'Liza-Lu is a-crying, and there's a</p>

<p>lot of folk in the house, and mother is a good deal better, but they</p>

<p>think father is dead!"</p>

<p>The child realized the grandeur of the news; but not as yet its</p>

<p>sadness, and stood looking at Tess with round-eyed importance till,</p>

<p>beholding the effect produced upon her, she said--</p>

<p>"What, Tess, shan't we talk to father never no more?"</p>

<p>"But father was only a little bit ill!" exclaimed Tess distractedly.</p>

<p>'Liza-Lu came up.</p>

<p>"He dropped down just now, and the doctor who was there for mother</p>

<p>said there was no chance for him, because his heart was growed in."</p>

<p>Yes; the Durbeyfield couple had changed places; the dying one was</p>

<p>out of danger, and the indisposed one was dead.  The news meant even</p>

<p>more than it sounded.  Her father's life had a value apart from his</p>

<p>personal achievements, or perhaps it would not have had much. It</p>

<p>was the last of the three lives for whose duration the house and</p>

<p>premises were held under a lease; and it had long been coveted by the</p>

<p>tenant-farmer for his regular labourers, who were stinted in cottage</p>

<p>accommodation.  Moreover, "liviers" were disapproved of in villages</p>

<p>almost as much as little freeholders, because of their independence</p>

<p>of manner, and when a lease determined it was never renewed.</p>

<p>Thus the Durbeyfields, once d'Urbervilles, saw descending upon them</p>

<p>the destiny which, no doubt, when they were among the Olympians of</p>

<p>the county, they had caused to descend many a time, and severely</p>

<p>enough, upon the heads of such landless ones as they themselves were</p>

<p>now.  So do flux and reflux--the rhythm of change--alternate and</p>

<p>persist in everything under the sky.</p>

<p>LI</p>

<p>At length it was the eve of Old Lady-Day, and the agricultural world</p>

<p>was in a fever of mobility such as only occurs at that particular</p>

<p>date of the year.  It is a day of fulfilment; agreements for outdoor</p>

<p>service during the ensuing year, entered into at Candlemas, are to</p>

<p>be now carried out.  The labourers--or "work-folk", as they used to</p>

<p>call themselves immemorially till the other word was introduced from</p>

<p>without--who wish to remain no longer in old places are removing to</p>

<p>the new farms.</p>

<p>These annual migrations from farm to farm were on the increase here.</p>

<p>When Tess's mother was a child the majority of the field-folk about</p>

<p>Marlott had remained all their lives on one farm, which had been the</p>

<p>home also of their fathers and grandfathers; but latterly the desire</p>

<p>for yearly removal had risen to a high pitch.  With the younger</p>

<p>families it was a pleasant excitement which might possibly be an</p>

<p>advantage.  The Egypt of one family was the Land of Promise to the</p>

<p>family who saw it from a distance, till by residence there it became</p>

<p>it turn their Egypt also; and so they changed and changed.</p>

<p>However, all the mutations so increasingly discernible in village</p>

<p>life did not originate entirely in the agricultural unrest.  A</p>

<p>depopulation was also going on.  The village had formerly contained,</p>

<p>side by side with the argicultural labourers, an interesting and</p>

<p>better-informed class, ranking distinctly above the former--the class</p>

<p>to which Tess's father and mother had belonged--and including the</p>

<p>carpenter, the smith, the shoemaker, the huckster, together with</p>

<p>nondescript workers other than farm-labourers; a set of people</p>

<p>who owed a certain stability of aim and conduct to the fact of</p>

<p>their being lifeholders like Tess's father, or copyholders, or</p>

<p>occasionally, small freeholders.  But as the long holdings fell</p>

<p>in, they were seldom again let to similar tenants, and were mostly</p>

<p>pulled down, if not absolutely required by the farmer for his hands.</p>

<p>Cottagers who were not directly employed on the land were looked</p>

<p>upon with disfavour, and the banishment of some starved the trade of</p>

<p>others, who were thus obliged to follow.  These families, who had</p>

<p>formed the backbone of the village life in the past, who were the</p>

<p>depositaries of the village traditions, had to seek refuge in the</p>

<p>large centres; the process, humorously designated by statisticians as</p>

<p>"the tendency of the rural population towards the large towns", being</p>

<p>really the tendency of water to flow uphill when forced by machinery.</p>

<p>The cottage accommodation at Marlott having been in this manner</p>

<p>considerably curtailed by demolitions, every house which remained</p>

<p>standing was required by the agriculturist for his work-people.  Ever</p>

<p>since the occurrence of the event which had cast such a shadow over</p>

<p>Tess's life, the Durbeyfield family (whose descent was not credited)</p>

<p>had been tacitly looked on as one which would have to go when their</p>

<p>lease ended, if only in the interests of morality.  It was, indeed,</p>

<p>quite true that the household had not been shining examples either of</p>

<p>temperance, soberness, or chastity.  The father, and even the mother,</p>

<p>had got drunk at times, the younger children seldom had gone to</p>

<p>church, and the eldest daughter had made queer unions.  By some means</p>

<p>the village had to be kept pure.  So on this, the first Lady-Day</p>

<p>on which the Durbeyfields were expellable, the house, being roomy,</p>

<p>was required for a carter with a large family; and Widow Joan,</p>

<p>her daughters Tess and 'Liza-Lu, the boy Abraham, and the younger</p>

<p>children had to go elsewhere.</p>

<p>On the evening preceding their removal it was getting dark betimes by</p>

<p>reason of a drizzling rain which blurred the sky.  As it was the last</p>

<p>night they would spend in the village which had been their home and</p>

<p>birthplace, Mrs Durbeyfield, 'Liza-Lu, and Abraham had gone out to</p>

<p>bid some friends goodbye, and Tess was keeping house till they should</p>

<p>return.</p>

<p>She was kneeling in the window-bench, her face close to the casement,</p>

<p>where an outer pane of rain-water was sliding down the inner pane of</p>

<p>glass.  Her eyes rested on the web of a spider, probably starved long</p>

<p>ago, which had been mistakenly placed in a corner where no flies</p>

<p>ever came, and shivered in the slight draught through the casement.</p>

<p>Tess was reflecting on the position of the household, in which she</p>

<p>perceived her own evil influence.  Had she not come home, her mother</p>

<p>and the children might probably have been allowed to stay on as</p>

<p>weekly tenants.  But she had been observed almost immediately on her</p>

<p>return by some people of scrupulous character and great influence:</p>

<p>they had seen her idling in the churchyard, restoring as well as she</p>

<p>could with a little trowel a baby's obliterated grave.  By this means</p>

<p>they had found that she was living here again; her mother was scolded</p>

<p>for "harbouring" her; sharp retorts had ensued from Joan, who had</p>

<p>independently offered to leave at once; she had been taken at her</p>

<p>word; and here was the result.</p>

<p>"I ought never to have come home," said Tess to herself, bitterly.</p>

<p>She was so intent upon these thoughts that she hardly at first took</p>

<p>note of a man in a white mackintosh whom she saw riding down the</p>

<p>street.  Possibly it was owing to her face being near to the pane</p>

<p>that he saw her so quickly, and directed his horse so close to the</p>

<p>cottage-front that his hoofs were almost upon the narrow border for</p>

<p>plants growing under the wall.  It was not till he touched the window</p>

<p>with his riding-crop that she observed him.  The rain had nearly</p>

<p>ceased, and she opened the casement in obedience to his gesture.</p>

<p>"Didn't you see me?" asked d'Urberville.</p>

<p>"I was not attending," she said.  "I heard you, I believe, though I</p>

<p>fancied it was a carriage and horses. I was in a sort of dream."</p>

<p>"Ah! you heard the d'Urberville Coach, perhaps.  You know the legend,</p>

<p>I suppose?"</p>

<p>"No.  My--somebody was going to tell it me once, but didn't."</p>

<p>"If you are a genuine d'Urberville I ought not to tell you either,</p>

<p>I suppose.  As for me, I'm a sham one, so it doesn't matter.  It is</p>

<p>rather dismal.  It is that this sound of a non-existent coach can</p>

<p>only be heard by one of d'Urberville blood, and it is held to be</p>

<p>of ill-omen to the one who hears it.  It has to do with a murder,</p>

<p>committed by one of the family, centuries ago."</p>

<p>"Now you have begun it, finish it."</p>

<p>"Very well.  One of the family is said to have abducted some</p>

<p>beautiful woman, who tried to escape from the coach in which he was</p>

<p>carrying her off, and in the struggle he killed her--or she killed</p>

<p>him--I forget which.  Such is one version of the tale...  I see that</p>

<p>your tubs and buckets are packed.  Going away, aren't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, to-morrow--Old Lady Day."</p>

<p>"I heard you were, but could hardly believe it; it seems so sudden.</p>

<p>Why is it?"</p>

<p>"Father's was the last life on the property, and when that dropped we</p>

<p>had no further right to stay.  Though we might, perhaps, have stayed</p>

<p>as weekly tenants--if it had not been for me."</p>

<p>"What about you?"</p>

<p>"I am not a--proper woman."</p>

<p>D'Urberville's face flushed.</p>

<p>"What a blasted shame!  Miserable snobs!  May their dirty souls</p>

<p>be burnt to cinders!" he exclaimed in tones of ironic resentment.</p>

<p>"That's why you are going, is it?  Turned out?"</p>

<p>"We are not turned out exactly; but as they said we should have to go</p>

<p>soon, it was best to go now everybody was moving, because there are</p>

<p>better chances."</p>

<p>"Where are you going to?"</p>

<p>"Kingsbere.  We have taken rooms there.  Mother is so foolish about</p>

<p>father's people that she will go there."</p>

<p>"But your mother's family are not fit for lodgings, and in a little</p>

<p>hole of a town like that.  Now why not come to my garden-house at</p>

<p>Trantridge?  There are hardly any poultry now, since my mother's</p>

<p>death; but there's the house, as you know it, and the garden.  It</p>

<p>can be whitewashed in a day, and your mother can live there quite</p>

<p>comfortably; and I will put the children to a good school.  Really</p>

<p>I ought to do something for you!"</p>

<p>"But we have already taken the rooms at Kingsbere!" she declared.</p>

<p>"And we can wait there--"</p>

<p>"Wait--what for?  For that nice husband, no doubt.  Now look here,</p>

<p>Tess, I know what men are, and, bearing in mind the _grounds_ of</p>

<p>your separation, I am quite positive he will never make it up with</p>

<p>you.  Now, though I have been your enemy, I am your friend, even</p>

<p>if you won't believe it.  Come to this cottage of mine. We'll get</p>

<p>up a regular colony of fowls, and your mother can attend to them</p>

<p>excellently; and the children can go to school."</p>

<p>Tess breathed more and more quickly, and at length she said--</p>

<p>"How do I know that you would do all this?  Your views may</p>

<p>change--and then--we should be--my mother would be--homeless</p>

<p>again."</p>

<p>"O no--no.  I would guarantee you against such as that in writing, if</p>

<p>necessary.  Think it over."</p>

<p>Tess shook her head.  But d'Urberville persisted; she had seldom seen</p>

<p>him so determined; he would not take a negative.</p>

<p>"Please just tell your mother," he said, in emphatic tones.  "It is</p>

<p>her business to judge--not yours.  I shall get the house swept out</p>

<p>and whitened to-morrow morning, and fires lit; and it will be dry by</p>

<p>the evening, so that you can come straight there.  Now mind, I shall</p>

<p>expect you."</p>

<p>Tess again shook her head, her throat swelling with complicated</p>

<p>emotion.  She could not look up at d'Urberville.</p>

<p>"I owe you something for the past, you know," he resumed.  "And you</p>

<p>cured me, too, of that craze; so I am glad--"</p>

<p>"I would rather you had kept the craze, so that you had kept the</p>

<p>practice which went with it!"</p>

<p>"I am glad of this opportunity of repaying you a little.  To-morrow I</p>

<p>shall expect to hear your mother's goods unloading...  Give me your</p>

<p>hand on it now--dear, beautiful Tess!"</p>

<p>With the last sentence he had dropped his voice to a murmur, and put</p>

<p>his hand in at the half-open casement.  With stormy eyes she pulled</p>

<p>the stay-bar quickly, and, in doing so, caught his arm between the</p>

<p>casement and the stone mullion.</p>

<p>"Damnation--you are very cruel!" he said, snatching out his arm.</p>

<p>"No, no!--I know you didn't do it on purpose.  Well I shall expect</p>

<p>you, or your mother and children at least."</p>

<p>"I shall not come--I have plenty of money!" she cried.</p>

<p>"Where?"</p>

<p>"At my father-in-law's, if I ask for it."</p>

<p>"IF you ask for it.  But you won't, Tess; I know you; you'll never</p>

<p>ask for it--you'll starve first!"</p>

<p>With these words he rode off.  Just at the corner of the street he</p>

<p>met the man with the paint-pot, who asked him if he had deserted the</p>

<p>brethren.</p>

<p>"You go to the devil!" said d'Urberville.</p>

<p>Tess remained where she was a long while, till a sudden rebellious</p>

<p>sense of injustice caused the region of her eyes to swell with the</p>

<p>rush of hot tears thither.  Her husband, Angel Clare himself, had,</p>

<p>like others, dealt out hard measure to her; surely he had!  She had</p>

<p>never before admitted such a thought; but he had surely!  Never</p>

<p>in her life--she could swear it from the bottom of her soul--had</p>

<p>she ever intended to do wrong; yet these hard judgements had</p>

<p>come.  Whatever her sins, they were not sins of intention, but of</p>

<p>inadvertence, and why should she have been punished so persistently?</p>

<p>She passionately seized the first piece of paper that came to hand,</p>

<p>and scribbled the following lines:</p>

<p>   O why have you treated me so monstrously, Angel! I do</p>

<p>   not deserve it.  I have thought it all over carefully,</p>

<p>   and I can never, never forgive you!  You know that I</p>

<p>   did not intend to wrong you--why have you so wronged</p>

<p>   me?  You are cruel, cruel indeed!  I will try to forget</p>

<p>   you.  It is all injustice I have received at your</p>

<p>   hands!</p>

<p>                                  T.</p>

<p>She watched till the postman passed by, ran out to him with</p>

<p>her epistle, and then again took her listless place inside the</p>

<p>window-panes.</p>

<p>It was just as well to write like that as to write tenderly.  How</p>

<p>could he give way to entreaty?  The facts had not changed: there was</p>

<p>no new event to alter his opinion.</p>

<p>It grew darker, the fire-light shining over the room.  The two</p>

<p>biggest of the younger children had gone out with their mother; the</p>

<p>four smallest, their ages ranging from three-and-a-half years to</p>

<p>eleven, all in black frocks, were gathered round the hearth babbling</p>

<p>their own little subjects.  Tess at length joined them, without</p>

<p>lighting a candle.</p>

<p>"This is the last night that we shall sleep here, dears, in the house</p>

<p>where we were born," she said quickly.  "We ought to think of it,</p>

<p>oughtn't we?"</p>

<p>They all became silent; with the impressibility of their age they</p>

<p>were ready to burst into tears at the picture of finality she had</p>

<p>conjured up, though all the day hitherto they had been rejoicing in</p>

<p>the idea of a new place.  Tess changed the subject.</p>

<p>"Sing to me, dears," she said.</p>

<p>"What shall we sing?"</p>

<p>"Anything you know; I don't mind."</p>

<p>There was a momentary pause; it was broken, first, in one little</p>

<p>tentative note; then a second voice strengthened it, and a third</p>

<p>and a fourth chimed in unison, with words they had learnt at the</p>

<p>Sunday-school--</p>

<p>     Here we suffer grief and pain,</p>

<p>     Here we meet to part again;</p>

<p>       In Heaven we part no more.</p>

<p>The four sang on with the phlegmatic passivity of persons who had</p>

<p>long ago settled the question, and there being no mistake about it,</p>

<p>felt that further thought was not required.  With features strained</p>

<p>hard to enunciate the syllables they continued to regard the centre</p>

<p>of the flickering fire, the notes of the youngest straying over into</p>

<p>the pauses of the rest.</p>

<p>Tess turned from them, and went to the window again.  Darkness had</p>

<p>now fallen without, but she put her face to the pane as though to</p>

<p>peer into the gloom.  It was really to hide her tears.  If she could</p>

<p>only believe what the children were singing; if she were only sure,</p>

<p>how different all would now be; how confidently she would leave them</p>

<p>to Providence and their future kingdom!  But, in default of that, it</p>

<p>behoved her to do something; to be their Providence; for to Tess,</p>

<p>as to not a few millions of others, there was ghastly satire in the</p>

<p>poet's lines--</p>

<p>                      Not in utter nakedness</p>

<p>     But trailing clouds of glory do we come.</p>

<p>To her and her like, birth itself was an ordeal of degrading personal</p>

<p>compulsion, whose gratuitousness nothing in the result seemed to</p>

<p>justify, and at best could only palliate.</p>

<p>In the shades of the wet road she soon discerned her mother with tall</p>

<p>'Liza-Lu and Abraham.  Mrs Durbeyfield's pattens clicked up to the</p>

<p>door, and Tess opened it.</p>

<p>"I see the tracks of a horse outside the window," said Joan.  "Hev</p>

<p>somebody called?"</p>

<p>"No," said Tess.</p>

<p>The children by the fire looked gravely at her, and one murmured--</p>

<p>"Why, Tess, the gentleman a-horseback!"</p>

<p>"He didn't call," said Tess.  "He spoke to me in passing."</p>

<p>"Who was the gentleman?" asked the mother.  "Your husband?"</p>

<p>"No.  He'll never, never come," answered Tess in stony hopelessness.</p>

<p>"Then who was it?"</p>

<p>"Oh, you needn't ask.  You've seen him before, and so have I."</p>

<p>"Ah!  What did he say?" said Joan curiously.</p>

<p>"I will tell you when we are settled in our lodging at Kingsbere</p>

<p>to-morrow--every word."</p>

<p>It was not her husband, she had said.  Yet a consciousness that in a</p>

<p>physical sense this man alone was her husband seemed to weigh on her</p>

<p>more and more.</p>

<p>LII</p>

<p>During the small hours of the next morning, while it was still dark,</p>

<p>dwellers near the highways were conscious of a disturbance of their</p>

<p>night's rest by rumbling noises, intermittently continuing till</p>

<p>daylight--noises as certain to recur in this particular first week of</p>

<p>the month as the voice of the cuckoo in the third week of the same.</p>

<p>They were the preliminaries of the general removal, the passing of</p>

<p>the empty waggons and teams to fetch the goods of the migrating</p>

<p>families; for it was always by the vehicle of the farmer who required</p>

<p>his services that the hired man was conveyed to his destination.</p>

<p>That this might be accomplished within the day was the explanation</p>

<p>of the reverberation occurring so soon after midnight, the aim of</p>

<p>the carters being to reach the door of the outgoing households by</p>

<p>six o'clock, when the loading of their movables at once began.</p>

<p>But to Tess and her mother's household no such anxious farmer sent</p>

<p>his team.  They were only women; they were not regular labourers;</p>

<p>they were not particularly required anywhere; hence they had to hire</p>

<p>a waggon at their own expense, and got nothing sent gratuitously.</p>

<p>It was a relief to Tess, when she looked out of the window that</p>

<p>morning, to find that though the weather was windy and louring, it</p>

<p>did not rain, and that the waggon had come.  A wet Lady-Day was a</p>

<p>spectre which removing families never forgot; damp furniture, damp</p>

<p>bedding, damp clothing accompanied it, and left a train of ills.</p>

<p>Her mother, 'Liza-Lu, and Abraham were also awake, but the younger</p>

<p>children were let sleep on.  The four breakfasted by the thin light,</p>

<p>and the "house-ridding" was taken in hand.</p>

<p>It proceeded with some cheerfulness, a friendly neighbour or two</p>

<p>assisting.  When the large articles of furniture had been packed in</p>

<p>position, a circular nest was made of the beds and bedding, in which</p>

<p>Joan Durbeyfield and the young children were to sit through the</p>

<p>journey.  After loading there was a long delay before the horses were</p>

<p>brought, these having been unharnessed during the ridding; but at</p>

<p>length, about two o'clock, the whole was under way, the cooking-pot</p>

<p>swinging from the axle of the waggon, Mrs Durbeyfield and family</p>

<p>at the top, the matron having in her lap, to prevent injury to its</p>

<p>works, the head of the clock, which, at any exceptional lurch of the</p>

<p>waggon, struck one, or one-and-a-half, in hurt tones.  Tess and the</p>

<p>next eldest girl walked alongside till they were out of the village.</p>

<p>They had called on a few neighbours that morning and the previous</p>

<p>evening, and some came to see them off, all wishing them well,</p>

<p>though, in their secret hearts, hardly expecting welfare possible</p>

<p>to such a family, harmless as the Durbeyfields were to all except</p>

<p>themselves.  Soon the equipage began to ascend to higher ground,</p>

<p>and the wind grew keener with the change of level and soil.</p>

<p>The day being the sixth of April, the Durbeyfield waggon met many</p>

<p>other waggons with families on the summit of the load, which was</p>

<p>built on a wellnigh unvarying principle, as peculiar, probably, to</p>

<p>the rural labourer as the hexagon to the bee.  The groundwork of the</p>

<p>arrangement was the family dresser, which, with its shining handles,</p>

<p>and finger-marks, and domestic evidences thick upon it, stood</p>

<p>importantly in front, over the tails of the shaft-horses, in its</p>

<p>erect and natural position, like some Ark of the Covenant that they</p>

<p>were bound to carry reverently.</p>

<p>Some of the households were lively, some mournful; some were stopping</p>

<p>at the doors of wayside inns; where, in due time, the Durbeyfield</p>

<p>menagerie also drew up to bait horses and refresh the travellers.</p>

<p>During the halt Tess's eyes fell upon a three-pint blue mug, which</p>

<p>was ascending and descending through the air to and from the feminine</p>

<p>section of a household, sitting on the summit of a load that had also</p>

<p>drawn up at a little distance from the same inn.  She followed one of</p>

<p>the mug's journeys upward, and perceived it to be clasped by hands</p>

<p>whose owner she well knew.  Tess went towards the waggon.</p>

<p>"Marian and Izz!" she cried to the girls, for it was they, sitting</p>

<p>with the moving family at whose house they had lodged.  "Are you</p>

<p>house-ridding to-day, like everybody else?"</p>

<p>They were, they said.  It had been too rough a life for them at</p>

<p>Flintcomb-Ash, and they had come away, almost without notice,</p>

<p>leaving Groby to prosecute them if he chose.  They told Tess their</p>

<p>destination, and Tess told them hers.</p>

<p>Marian leant over the load, and lowered her voice.  "Do you know that</p>

<p>the gentleman who follows 'ee--you'll guess who I mean--came to ask</p>

<p>for 'ee at Flintcomb after you had gone?  We didn't tell'n where you</p>

<p>was, knowing you wouldn't wish to see him."</p>

<p>"Ah--but I did see him!" Tess murmured.  "He found me."</p>

<p>"And do he know where you be going?"</p>

<p>"I think so."</p>

<p>"Husband come back?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>She bade her acquaintance goodbye--for the respective carters had now</p>

<p>come out from the inn--and the two waggons resumed their journey in</p>

<p>opposite directions; the vehicle whereon sat Marian, Izz, and the</p>

<p>ploughman's family with whom they had thrown in their lot, being</p>

<p>brightly painted, and drawn by three powerful horses with shining</p>

<p>brass ornaments on their harness; while the waggon on which Mrs</p>

<p>Durbeyfield and her family rode was a creaking erection that would</p>

<p>scarcely bear the weight of the superincumbent load; one which had</p>

<p>known no paint since it was made, and drawn by two horses only.</p>

<p>The contrast well marked the difference between being fetched by a</p>

<p>thriving farmer and conveying oneself whither no hirer waited one's</p>

<p>coming.</p>

<p>The distance was great--too great for a day's journey--and it was</p>

<p>with the utmost difficulty that the horses performed it.  Though they</p>

<p>had started so early, it was quite late in the afternoon when they</p>

<p>turned the flank of an eminence which formed part of the upland</p>

<p>called Greenhill.  While the horses stood to stale and breathe</p>

<p>themselves Tess looked around.  Under the hill, and just ahead of</p>

<p>them, was the half-dead townlet of their pilgrimage, Kingsbere,</p>

<p>where lay those ancestors of whom her father had spoken and sung to</p>

<p>painfulness: Kingsbere, the spot of all spots in the world which</p>

<p>could be considered the d'Urbervilles' home, since they had resided</p>

<p>there for full five hundred years.</p>

<p>A man could be seen advancing from the outskirts towards them, and</p>

<p>when he beheld the nature of their waggon-load he quickened his</p>

<p>steps.</p>

<p>"You be the woman they call Mrs Durbeyfield, I reckon?" he said to</p>

<p>Tess's mother, who had descended to walk the remainder of the way.</p>

<p>She nodded.  "Though widow of the late Sir John d'Urberville, poor</p>

<p>nobleman, if I cared for my rights; and returning to the domain of</p>

<p>his forefathers."</p>

<p>"Oh?  Well, I know nothing about that; but if you be Mrs Durbeyfield,</p>

<p>I am sent to tell 'ee that the rooms you wanted be let.  We didn't</p>

<p>know that you was coming till we got your letter this morning--when</p>

<p>'twas too late.  But no doubt you can get other lodgings somewhere."</p>

<p>The man had noticed the face of Tess, which had become ash-pale at</p>

<p>his intelligence.  Her mother looked hopelessly at fault.  "What</p>

<p>shall we do now, Tess?" she said bitterly.  "Here's a welcome to</p>

<p>your ancestors' lands!  However, let's try further."</p>

<p>They moved on into the town, and tried with all their might, Tess</p>

<p>remaining with the waggon to take care of the children whilst her</p>

<p>mother and 'Liza-Lu made inquiries.  At the last return of Joan to</p>

<p>the vehicle, an hour later, when her search for accommodation had</p>

<p>still been fruitless, the driver of the waggon said the goods must be</p>

<p>unloaded, as the horses were half-dead, and he was bound to return</p>

<p>part of the way at least that night.</p>

<p>"Very well--unload it here," said Joan recklessly.  "I'll get shelter</p>

<p>somewhere."</p>

<p>The waggon had drawn up under the churchyard wall, in a spot screened</p>

<p>from view, and the driver, nothing loth, soon hauled down the poor</p>

<p>heap of household goods.  This done, she paid him, reducing herself</p>

<p>to almost her last shilling thereby, and he moved off and left them,</p>

<p>only too glad to get out of further dealings with such a family.  It</p>

<p>was a dry night, and he guessed that they would come to no harm.</p>

<p>Tess gazed desperately at the pile of furniture.  The cold sunlight</p>

<p>of this spring evening peered invidiously upon the crocks and</p>

<p>kettles, upon the bunches of dried herbs shivering in the breeze,</p>

<p>upon the brass handles of the dresser, upon the wicker-cradle they</p>

<p>had all been rocked in, and upon the well-rubbed clock-case, all of</p>

<p>which gave out the reproachful gleam of indoor articles abandoned to</p>

<p>the vicissitudes of a roofless exposure for which they were never</p>

<p>made.  Round about were deparked hills and slopes--now cut up</p>

<p>into little paddocks--and the green foundations that showed where</p>

<p>the d'Urberville mansion once had stood; also an outlying stretch</p>

<p>of Egdon Heath that had always belonged to the estate.  Hard by,</p>

<p>the aisle of the church called the d'Urberville Aisle looked on</p>

<p>imperturbably.</p>

<p>"Isn't your family vault your own freehold?" said Tess's mother, as</p>

<p>she returned from a reconnoitre of the church and graveyard.  "Why,</p>

<p>of course 'tis, and that's where we will camp, girls, till the place</p>

<p>of your ancestors finds us a roof!  Now, Tess and 'Liza and Abraham,</p>

<p>you help me.  We'll make a nest for these children, and then we'll</p>

<p>have another look round."</p>

<p>Tess listlessly lent a hand, and in a quarter of an hour the old</p>

<p>four-post bedstead was dissociated from the heap of goods, and</p>

<p>erected under the south wall of the church, the part of the building</p>

<p>known as the d'Urberville Aisle, beneath which the huge vaults lay.</p>

<p>Over the tester of the bedstead was a beautiful traceried window, of</p>

<p>many lights, its date being the fifteenth century.  It was called</p>

<p>the d'Urberville Window, and in the upper part could be discerned</p>

<p>heraldic emblems like those on Durbeyfield's old seal and spoon.</p>

<p>Joan drew the curtains round the bed so as to make an excellent tent</p>

<p>of it, and put the smaller children inside.  "If it comes to the</p>

<p>worst we can sleep there too, for one night," she said.  "But let us</p>

<p>try further on, and get something for the dears to eat!  O, Tess,</p>

<p>what's the use of your playing at marrying gentlemen, if it leaves</p>

<p>us like this!"</p>

<p>Accompanied by 'Liza-Lu and the boy, she again ascended the little</p>

<p>lane which secluded the church from the townlet.  As soon as they got</p>

<p>into the street they beheld a man on horseback gazing up and down.</p>

<p>"Ah--I'm looking for you!" he said, riding up to them.  "This is</p>

<p>indeed a family gathering on the historic spot!"</p>

<p>It was Alec d'Urberville.  "Where is Tess?" he asked.</p>

<p>Personally Joan had no liking for Alec.  She cursorily signified the</p>

<p>direction of the church, and went on, d'Urberville saying that he</p>

<p>would see them again, in case they should be still unsuccessful in</p>

<p>their search for shelter, of which he had just heard.  When they had</p>

<p>gone, d'Urberville rode to the inn, and shortly after came out on</p>

<p>foot.</p>

<p>In the interim Tess, left with the children inside the bedstead,</p>

<p>remained talking with them awhile, till, seeing that no more could</p>

<p>be done to make them comfortable just then, she walked about the</p>

<p>churchyard, now beginning to be embrowned by the shades of nightfall.</p>

<p>The door of the church was unfastened, and she entered it for the</p>

<p>first time in her life.</p>

<p>Within the window under which the bedstead stood were the tombs of</p>

<p>the family, covering in their dates several centuries.  They were</p>

<p>canopied, altar-shaped, and plain; their carvings being defaced</p>

<p>and broken; their brasses torn from the matrices, the rivet-holes</p>

<p>remaining like martin-holes in a sandcliff.  Of all the reminders</p>

<p>that she had ever received that her people were socially extinct,</p>

<p>there was none so forcible as this spoliation.</p>

<p>She drew near to a dark stone on which was inscribed:</p>

<p>   OSTIUM SEPULCHRI ANTIQUAE FAMILIAE D'URBERVILLE</p>

<p>Tess did not read Church-Latin like a Cardinal, but she knew that</p>

<p>this was the door of her ancestral sepulchre, and that the tall</p>

<p>knights of whom her father had chanted in his cups lay inside.</p>

<p>She musingly turned to withdraw, passing near an altar-tomb, the</p>

<p>oldest of them all, on which was a recumbent figure.  In the dusk she</p>

<p>had not noticed it before, and would hardly have noticed it now but</p>

<p>for an odd fancy that the effigy moved.  As soon as she drew close</p>

<p>to it she discovered all in a moment that the figure was a living</p>

<p>person; and the shock to her sense of not having been alone was so</p>

<p>violent that she was quite overcome, and sank down nigh to fainting,</p>

<p>not, however, till she had recognized Alec d'Urberville in the form.</p>

<p>He leapt off the slab and supported her.</p>

<p>"I saw you come in," he said smiling, "and got up there not to</p>

<p>interrupt your meditations.  A family gathering, is it not, with</p>

<p>these old fellows under us here?  Listen."</p>

<p>He stamped with his heel heavily on the floor; whereupon there arose</p>

<p>a hollow echo from below.</p>

<p>"That shook them a bit, I'll warrant!" he continued.  "And you</p>

<p>thought I was the mere stone reproduction of one of them.  But no.</p>

<p>The old order changeth.  The little finger of the sham d'Urberville</p>

<p>can do more for you than the whole dynasty of the real underneath...</p>

<p>Now command me.  What shall I do?"</p>

<p>"Go away!" she murmured.</p>

<p>"I will--I'll look for your mother," said he blandly.  But in passing</p>

<p>her he whispered: "Mind this; you'll be civil yet!"</p>

<p>When he was gone she bent down upon the entrance to the vaults, and</p>

<p>said--</p>

<p>"Why am I on the wrong side of this door!"</p>

<p>In the meantime Marian and Izz Huett had journeyed onward with the</p>

<p>chattels of the ploughman in the direction of their land of Canaan--</p>

<p>the Egypt of some other family who had left it only that morning.</p>

<p>But the girls did not for a long time think of where they were going.</p>

<p>Their talk was of Angel Clare and Tess, and Tess's persistent lover,</p>

<p>whose connection with her previous history they had partly heard and</p>

<p>partly guessed ere this.</p>

<p>"'Tisn't as though she had never known him afore," said Marian.  "His</p>

<p>having won her once makes all the difference in the world.  'Twould</p>

<p>be a thousand pities if he were to tole her away again.  Mr Clare can</p>

<p>never be anything to us, Izz; and why should we grudge him to her,</p>

<p>and not try to mend this quarrel?  If he could on'y know what straits</p>

<p>she's put to, and what's hovering round, he might come to take care</p>

<p>of his own."</p>

<p>"Could we let him know?"</p>

<p>They thought of this all the way to their destination; but the bustle</p>

<p>of re-establishment in their new place took up all their attention</p>

<p>then.  But when they were settled, a month later, they heard of</p>

<p>Clare's approaching return, though they had learnt nothing more of</p>

<p>Tess.  Upon that, agitated anew by their attachment to him, yet</p>

<p>honourably disposed to her, Marian uncorked the penny ink-bottle they</p>

<p>shared, and a few lines were concocted between the two girls.</p>

<p>   HONOUR'D SIR--</p>

<p>   Look to your Wife if you do love her as much as she do</p>

<p>   love you.  For she is sore put to by an Enemy in the shape</p>

<p>   of a Friend.  Sir, there is one near her who ought to be</p>

<p>   Away.  A woman should not be try'd beyond her Strength,</p>

<p>   and continual dropping will wear away a Stone--ay,</p>

<p>   more--a Diamond.</p>

<p>   FROM TWO WELL-WISHERS</p>

<p>This was addressed to Angel Clare at the only place they had ever</p>

<p>heard him to be connected with, Emminster Vicarage; after which they</p>

<p>continued in a mood of emotional exaltation at their own generosity,</p>

<p>which made them sing in hysterical snatches and weep at the same</p>

<p>time.</p>

<p>END OF PHASE THE SIXTH</p><empty-line /><p>Phase the Seventh: Fulfilment</p>

<p>LIII</p>

<p>It was evening at Emminster Vicarage.  The two customary candles were</p>

<p>burning under their green shades in the Vicar's study, but he had not</p>

<p>been sitting there.  Occasionally he came in, stirred the small fire</p>

<p>which sufficed for the increasing mildness of the spring, and went</p>

<p>out again; sometimes pausing at the front door, going on to the</p>

<p>drawing-room, then returning again to the front door.</p>

<p>It faced westward, and though gloom prevailed inside, there was still</p>

<p>light enough without to see with distinctness.  Mrs Clare, who had</p>

<p>been sitting in the drawing-room, followed him hither.</p>

<p>"Plenty of time yet," said the Vicar.  "He doesn't reach Chalk-Newton</p>

<p>till six, even if the train should be punctual, and ten miles of</p>

<p>country-road, five of them in Crimmercrock Lane, are not jogged over</p>

<p>in a hurry by our old horse."</p>

<p>"But he has done it in an hour with us, my dear."</p>

<p>"Years ago."</p>

<p>Thus they passed the minutes, each well knowing that this was only</p>

<p>waste of breath, the one essential being simply to wait.</p>

<p>At length there was a slight noise in the lane, and the old</p>

<p>pony-chaise appeared indeed outside the railings.  They saw alight</p>

<p>therefrom a form which they affected to recognize, but would actually</p>

<p>have passed by in the street without identifying had he not got out</p>

<p>of their carriage at the particular moment when a particular person</p>

<p>was due.</p>

<p>Mrs Clare rushed through the dark passage to the door, and her</p>

<p>husband came more slowly after her.</p>

<p>The new arrival, who was just about to enter, saw their anxious faces</p>

<p>in the doorway and the gleam of the west in their spectacles because</p>

<p>they confronted the last rays of day; but they could only see his</p>

<p>shape against the light.</p>

<p>"O, my boy, my boy--home again at last!" cried Mrs Clare, who cared</p>

<p>no more at that moment for the stains of heterodoxy which had caused</p>

<p>all this separation than for the dust upon his clothes.  What woman,</p>

<p>indeed, among the most faithful adherents of the truth, believes the</p>

<p>promises and threats of the Word in the sense in which she believes</p>

<p>in her own children, or would not throw her theology to the wind if</p>

<p>weighed against their happiness?  As soon as they reached the room</p>

<p>where the candles were lighted she looked at his face.</p>

<p>"O, it is not Angel--not my son--the Angel who went away!" she cried</p>

<p>in all the irony of sorrow, as she turned herself aside.</p>

<p>His father, too, was shocked to see him, so reduced was that figure</p>

<p>from its former contours by worry and the bad season that Clare had</p>

<p>experienced, in the climate to which he had so rashly hurried in his</p>

<p>first aversion to the mockery of events at home.  You could see the</p>

<p>skeleton behind the man, and almost the ghost behind the skeleton.</p>

<p>He matched Crivelli's dead _Christus_.  His sunken eye-pits were of</p>

<p>morbid hue, and the light in his eyes had waned.  The angular hollows</p>

<p>and lines of his aged ancestors had succeeded to their reign in his</p>

<p>face twenty years before their time.</p>

<p>"I was ill over there, you know," he said.  "I am all right now."</p>

<p>As if, however, to falsify this assertion, his legs seemed to give</p>

<p>way, and he suddenly sat down to save himself from falling.  It was</p>

<p>only a slight attack of faintness, resulting from the tedious day's</p>

<p>journey, and the excitement of arrival.</p>

<p>"Has any letter come for me lately?" he asked.  "I received the</p>

<p>last you sent on by the merest chance, and after considerable delay</p>

<p>through being inland; or I might have come sooner."</p>

<p>"It was from your wife, we supposed?"</p>

<p>"It was."</p>

<p>Only one other had recently come.  They had not sent it on to him,</p>

<p>knowing he would start for home so soon.</p>

<p>He hastily opened the letter produced, and was much disturbed to read</p>

<p>in Tess's handwriting the sentiments expressed in her last hurried</p>

<p>scrawl to him.</p>

<p>   O why have you treated me so monstrously, Angel! I do</p>

<p>   not deserve it.  I have thought it all over carefully,</p>

<p>   and I can never, never forgive you!  You know that I</p>

<p>   did not intend to wrong you--why have you so wronged</p>

<p>   me?  You are cruel, cruel indeed!  I will try to forget</p>

<p>   you.  It is all injustice I have received at your</p>

<p>   hands!</p>

<p>                                  T.</p>

<p>"It is quite true!" said Angel, throwing down the letter.  "Perhaps</p>

<p>she will never be reconciled to me!"</p>

<p>"Don't, Angel, be so anxious about a mere child of the soil!" said</p>

<p>his mother.</p>

<p>"Child of the soil!  Well, we all are children of the soil.  I wish</p>

<p>she were so in the sense you mean; but let me now explain to you what</p>

<p>I have never explained before, that her father is a descendant in the</p>

<p>male line of one of the oldest Norman houses, like a good many others</p>

<p>who lead obscure agricultural lives in our villages, and are dubbed</p>

<p>'sons of the soil.'"</p>

<p>He soon retired to bed; and the next morning, feeling exceedingly</p>

<p>unwell, he remained in his room pondering.  The circumstances amid</p>

<p>which he had left Tess were such that though, while on the south of</p>

<p>the Equator and just in receipt of her loving epistle, it had seemed</p>

<p>the easiest thing in the world to rush back into her arms the moment</p>

<p>he chose to forgive her, now that he had arrived it was not so easy</p>

<p>as it had seemed.  She was passionate, and her present letter,</p>

<p>showing that her estimate of him had changed under his delay--too</p>

<p>justly changed, he sadly owned,--made him ask himself if it would</p>

<p>be wise to confront her unannounced in the presence of her parents.</p>

<p>Supposing that her love had indeed turned to dislike during the last</p>

<p>weeks of separation, a sudden meeting might lead to bitter words.</p>

<p>Clare therefore thought it would be best to prepare Tess and her</p>

<p>family by sending a line to Marlott announcing his return, and his</p>

<p>hope that she was still living with them there, as he had arranged</p>

<p>for her to do when he left England.  He despatched the inquiry that</p>

<p>very day, and before the week was out there came a short reply from</p>

<p>Mrs Durbeyfield which did not remove his embarrassment, for it bore</p>

<p>no address, though to his surprise it was not written from Marlott.</p>

<p>   SIR,</p>

<p>   J write these few lines to say that my Daughter is away</p>

<p>   from me at present, and J am not sure when she will</p>

<p>   return, but J will let you know as Soon as she do.</p>

<p>   J do not feel at liberty to tell you Where she is</p>

<p>   temperly biding.  J should say that me and my Family</p>

<p>   have left Marlott for some Time.--</p>

<p>   Yours,</p>

<p>   J. DURBEYFIELD</p>

<p>It was such a relief to Clare to learn that Tess was at least</p>

<p>apparently well that her mother's stiff reticence as to her</p>

<p>whereabouts did not long distress him.  They were all angry with him,</p>

<p>evidently.  He would wait till Mrs Durbeyfield could inform him of</p>

<p>Tess's return, which her letter implied to be soon.  He deserved no</p>

<p>more.  His had been a love "which alters when it alteration finds".</p>

<p>He had undergone some strange experiences in his absence; he had seen</p>

<p>the virtual Faustina in the literal Cornelia, a spiritual Lucretia in</p>

<p>a corporeal Phryne; he had thought of the woman taken and set in the</p>

<p>midst as one deserving to be stoned, and of the wife of Uriah being</p>

<p>made a queen; and he had asked himself why he had not judged Tess</p>

<p>constructively rather than biographically, by the will rather than</p>

<p>by the deed?</p>

<p>A day or two passed while he waited at his father's house for the</p>

<p>promised second note from Joan Durbeyfield, and indirectly to recover</p>

<p>a little more strength.  The strength showed signs of coming back,</p>

<p>but there was no sign of Joan's letter.  Then he hunted up the</p>

<p>old letter sent on to him in Brazil, which Tess had written from</p>

<p>Flintcomb-Ash, and re-read it.  The sentences touched him now as</p>

<p>much as when he had first perused them.</p>

<p>   ... I must cry to you in my trouble--I have no one</p>

<p>   else! ...  I think I must die if you do not come</p>

<p>   soon, or tell me to come to you... please, please,</p>

<p>   not to be just--only a little kind to me ...  If</p>

<p>   you would come, I could die in your arms!  I would</p>

<p>   be well content to do that if so be you had forgiven</p>

<p>   me! ... if you will send me one little line, and say,</p>

<p>   "I am coming soon," I will bide on, Angel--O, so</p>

<p>   cheerfully! ... think how it do hurt my heart not to</p>

<p>   see you ever--ever!  Ah, if I could only make your</p>

<p>   dear heart ache one little minute of each day as mine</p>

<p>   does every day and all day long, it might lead you to</p>

<p>   show pity to your poor lonely one. ...  I would be</p>

<p>   content, ay, glad, to live with you as your servant,</p>

<p>   if I may not as your wife; so that I could only be</p>

<p>   near you, and get glimpses of you, and think of you</p>

<p>   as mine. ...  I long for only one thing in heaven</p>

<p>   or earth or under the earth, to meet you, my own</p>

<p>   dear!  Come to me--come to me, and save me from what</p>

<p>   threatens me!</p>

<p>Clare determined that he would no longer believe in her more recent</p>

<p>and severer regard of him, but would go and find her immediately.  He</p>

<p>asked his father if she had applied for any money during his absence.</p>

<p>His father returned a negative, and then for the first time it</p>

<p>occurred to Angel that her pride had stood in her way, and that she</p>

<p>had suffered privation.  From his remarks his parents now gathered</p>

<p>the real reason of the separation; and their Christianity was such</p>

<p>that, reprobates being their especial care, the tenderness towards</p>

<p>Tess which her blood, her simplicity, even her poverty, had not</p>

<p>engendered, was instantly excited by her sin.</p>

<p>Whilst he was hastily packing together a few articles for his journey</p>

<p>he glanced over a poor plain missive also lately come to hand--the</p>

<p>one from Marian and Izz Huett, beginning--</p>

<p>"Honour'd Sir, Look to your Wife if you do love her as much as she do</p>

<p>love you," and signed, "From Two Well-Wishers."</p>

<p>LIV</p>

<p>In a quarter of an hour Clare was leaving the house, whence his</p>

<p>mother watched his thin figure as it disappeared into the street.</p>

<p>He had declined to borrow his father's old mare, well knowing of</p>

<p>its necessity to the household.  He went to the inn, where he hired</p>

<p>a trap, and could hardly wait during the harnessing.  In a very few</p>

<p>minutes after, he was driving up the hill out of the town which,</p>

<p>three or four months earlier in the year, Tess had descended with</p>

<p>such hopes and ascended with such shattered purposes.</p>

<p>Benvill Lane soon stretched before him, its hedges and trees purple</p>

<p>with buds; but he was looking at other things, and only recalled</p>

<p>himself to the scene sufficiently to enable him to keep the way.  In</p>

<p>something less than an hour-and-a-half he had skirted the south of</p>

<p>the King's Hintock estates and ascended to the untoward solitude of</p>

<p>Cross-in-Hand, the unholy stone whereon Tess had been compelled by</p>

<p>Alec d'Urberville, in his whim of reformation, to swear the strange</p>

<p>oath that she would never wilfully tempt him again.  The pale and</p>

<p>blasted nettle-stems of the preceding year even now lingered nakedly</p>

<p>in the banks, young green nettles of the present spring growing from</p>

<p>their roots.</p>

<p>Thence he went along the verge of the upland overhanging the other</p>

<p>Hintocks, and, turning to the right, plunged into the bracing</p>

<p>calcareous region of Flintcomb-Ash, the address from which she had</p>

<p>written to him in one of the letters, and which he supposed to be</p>

<p>the place of sojourn referred to by her mother.  Here, of course, he</p>

<p>did not find her; and what added to his depression was the discovery</p>

<p>that no "Mrs Clare" had ever been heard of by the cottagers or by</p>

<p>the farmer himself, though Tess was remembered well enough by her</p>

<p>Christian name.  His name she had obviously never used during their</p>

<p>separation, and her dignified sense of their total severance was</p>

<p>shown not much less by this abstention than by the hardships she had</p>

<p>chosen to undergo (of which he now learnt for the first time) rather</p>

<p>than apply to his father for more funds.</p>

<p>From this place they told him Tess Durbeyfield had gone, without due</p>

<p>notice, to the home of her parents on the other side of Blackmoor,</p>

<p>and it therefore became necessary to find Mrs Durbeyfield.  She had</p>

<p>told him she was not now at Marlott, but had been curiously reticent</p>

<p>as to her actual address, and the only course was to go to Marlott</p>

<p>and inquire for it.  The farmer who had been so churlish with Tess</p>

<p>was quite smooth-tongued to Clare, and lent him a horse and man to</p>

<p>drive him towards Marlott, the gig he had arrived in being sent back</p>

<p>to Emminster; for the limit of a day's journey with that horse was</p>

<p>reached.</p>

<p>Clare would not accept the loan of the farmer's vehicle for a further</p>

<p>distance than to the outskirts of the Vale, and, sending it back with</p>

<p>the man who had driven him, he put up at an inn, and next day entered</p>

<p>on foot the region wherein was the spot of his dear Tess's birth.</p>

<p>It was as yet too early in the year for much colour to appear in the</p>

<p>gardens and foliage; the so-called spring was but winter overlaid</p>

<p>with a thin coat of greenness, and it was of a parcel with his</p>

<p>expectations.</p>

<p>The house in which Tess had passed the years of her childhood was</p>

<p>now inhabited by another family who had never known her.  The new</p>

<p>residents were in the garden, taking as much interest in their own</p>

<p>doings as if the homestead had never passed its primal time in</p>

<p>conjunction with the histories of others, beside which the histories</p>

<p>of these were but as a tale told by an idiot.  They walked about the</p>

<p>garden paths with thoughts of their own concerns entirely uppermost,</p>

<p>bringing their actions at every moment in jarring collision with the</p>

<p>dim ghosts behind them, talking as though the time when Tess lived</p>

<p>there were not one whit intenser in story than now.  Even the spring</p>

<p>birds sang over their heads as if they thought there was nobody</p>

<p>missing in particular.</p>

<p>On inquiry of these precious innocents, to whom even the name of</p>

<p>their predecessors was a failing memory, Clare learned that John</p>

<p>Durbeyfield was dead; that his widow and children had left Marlott,</p>

<p>declaring that they were going to live at Kingsbere, but instead of</p>

<p>doing so had gone on to another place they mentioned.  By this time</p>

<p>Clare abhorred the house for ceasing to contain Tess, and hastened</p>

<p>away from its hated presence without once looking back.</p>

<p>His way was by the field in which he had first beheld her at the</p>

<p>dance.  It was as bad as the house--even worse.  He passed on through</p>

<p>the churchyard, where, amongst the new headstones, he saw one of a</p>

<p>somewhat superior design to the rest.  The inscription ran thus:</p>

<p>  In memory of John Durbeyfield, rightly d'Urberville, of</p>

<p>  the once powerful family of that Name, and Direct</p>

<p>  Descendant through an illustrious Line from Sir Pagan</p>

<p>  d'Urberville, one of the Knights of the Conqueror.  Died</p>

<p>  March 10th, 18--</p>

<p>                HOW ARE THE MIGHTY FALLEN.</p>

<p>Some man, apparently the sexton, had observed Clare standing there,</p>

<p>and drew nigh.  "Ah, sir, now that's a man who didn't want to lie</p>

<p>here, but wished to be carried to Kingsbere, where his ancestors be."</p>

<p>"And why didn't they respect his wish?"</p>

<p>"Oh--no money.  Bless your soul, sir, why--there, I wouldn't wish to</p>

<p>say it everywhere, but--even this headstone, for all the flourish</p>

<p>wrote upon en, is not paid for."</p>

<p>"Ah, who put it up?"</p>

<p>The man told the name of a mason in the village, and, on leaving the</p>

<p>churchyard, Clare called at the mason's house.  He found that the</p>

<p>statement was true, and paid the bill.  This done, he turned in the</p>

<p>direction of the migrants.</p>

<p>The distance was too long for a walk, but Clare felt such a strong</p>

<p>desire for isolation that at first he would neither hire a conveyance</p>

<p>nor go to a circuitous line of railway by which he might eventually</p>

<p>reach the place.  At Shaston, however, he found he must hire; but</p>

<p>the way was such that he did not enter Joan's place till about seven</p>

<p>o'clock in the evening, having traversed a distance of over twenty</p>

<p>miles since leaving Marlott.</p>

<p>The village being small he had little difficulty in finding Mrs</p>

<p>Durbeyfield's tenement, which was a house in a walled garden,</p>

<p>remote from the main road, where she had stowed away her clumsy old</p>

<p>furniture as best she could.  It was plain that for some reason or</p>

<p>other she had not wished him to visit her, and he felt his call to</p>

<p>be somewhat of an intrusion.  She came to the door herself, and the</p>

<p>light from the evening sky fell upon her face.</p>

<p>This was the first time that Clare had ever met her, but he was too</p>

<p>preoccupied to observe more than that she was still a handsome woman,</p>

<p>in the garb of a respectable widow.  He was obliged to explain that</p>

<p>he was Tess's husband, and his object in coming there, and he did it</p>

<p>awkwardly enough.  "I want to see her at once," he added.  "You said</p>

<p>you would write to me again, but you have not done so."</p>

<p>"Because she've not come home," said Joan.</p>

<p>"Do you know if she is well?"</p>

<p>"I don't.  But you ought to, sir," said she.</p>

<p>"I admit it.  Where is she staying?"</p>

<p>From the beginning of the interview Joan had disclosed her</p>

<p>embarrassment by keeping her hand to the side of her cheek.</p>

<p>"I--don't know exactly where she is staying," she answered. "She</p>

<p>was--but--"</p>

<p>"Where was she?"</p>

<p>"Well, she is not there now."</p>

<p>In her evasiveness she paused again, and the younger children had by</p>

<p>this time crept to the door, where, pulling at his mother's skirts,</p>

<p>the youngest murmured--</p>

<p>"Is this the gentleman who is going to marry Tess?"</p>

<p>"He has married her," Joan whispered.  "Go inside."</p>

<p>Clare saw her efforts for reticence, and asked--</p>

<p>"Do you think Tess would wish me to try and find her?  If not, of</p>

<p>course--"</p>

<p>"I don't think she would."</p>

<p>"Are you sure?"</p>

<p>"I am sure she wouldn't."</p>

<p>He was turning away; and then he thought of Tess's tender letter.</p>

<p>"I am sure she would!" he retorted passionately.  "I know her better</p>

<p>than you do."</p>

<p>"That's very likely, sir; for I have never really known her."</p>

<p>"Please tell me her address, Mrs Durbeyfield, in kindness to a lonely</p>

<p>wretched man!"  Tess's mother again restlessly swept her cheek with</p>

<p>her vertical hand, and seeing that he suffered, she at last said, is</p>

<p>a low voice--</p>

<p>"She is at Sandbourne."</p>

<p>"Ah--where there?  Sandbourne has become a large place, they say."</p>

<p>"I don't know more particularly than I have said--Sandbourne.  For</p>

<p>myself, I was never there."</p>

<p>It was apparent that Joan spoke the truth in this, and he pressed her</p>

<p>no further.</p>

<p>"Are you in want of anything?" he said gently.</p>

<p>"No, sir," she replied.  "We are fairly well provided for."</p>

<p>Without entering the house Clare turned away.  There was a station</p>

<p>three miles ahead, and paying off his coachman, he walked thither.</p>

<p>The last train to Sandbourne left shortly after, and it bore Clare</p>

<p>on its wheels.</p>

<p>LV</p>

<p>At eleven o'clock that night, having secured a bed at one of the</p>

<p>hotels and telegraphed his address to his father immediately on his</p>

<p>arrival, he walked out into the streets of Sandbourne.  It was too</p>

<p>late to call on or inquire for any one, and he reluctantly postponed</p>

<p>his purpose till the morning.  But he could not retire to rest just</p>

<p>yet.</p>

<p>This fashionable watering-place, with its eastern and its western</p>

<p>stations, its piers, its groves of pines, its promenades, and its</p>

<p>covered gardens, was, to Angel Clare, like a fairy place suddenly</p>

<p>created by the stroke of a wand, and allowed to get a little dusty.</p>

<p>An outlying eastern tract of the enormous Egdon Waste was close at</p>

<p>hand, yet on the very verge of that tawny piece of antiquity such a</p>

<p>glittering novelty as this pleasure city had chosen to spring up.</p>

<p>Within the space of a mile from its outskirts every irregularity</p>

<p>of the soil was prehistoric, every channel an undisturbed British</p>

<p>trackway; not a sod having been turned there since the days of the</p>

<p>Caesars.  Yet the exotic had grown here, suddenly as the prophet's</p>

<p>gourd; and had drawn hither Tess.</p>

<p>By the midnight lamps he went up and down the winding way of this new</p>

<p>world in an old one, and could discern between the trees and against</p>

<p>the stars the lofty roofs, chimneys, gazebos, and towers of the</p>

<p>numerous fanciful residences of which the place was composed. It</p>

<p>was a city of detached mansions; a Mediterranean lounging-place on</p>

<p>the English Channel; and as seen now by night it seemed even more</p>

<p>imposing than it was.</p>

<p>The sea was near at hand, but not intrusive; it murmured, and he</p>

<p>thought it was the pines; the pines murmured in precisely the same</p>

<p>tones, and he thought they were the sea.</p>

<p>Where could Tess possibly be, a cottage-girl, his young wife, amidst</p>

<p>all this wealth and fashion?  The more he pondered, the more was he</p>

<p>puzzled.  Were there any cows to milk here?  There certainly were</p>

<p>no fields to till. She was most probably engaged to do something in</p>

<p>one of these large houses; and he sauntered along, looking at the</p>

<p>chamber-windows and their lights going out one by one, and wondered</p>

<p>which of them might be hers.</p>

<p>Conjecture was useless, and just after twelve o'clock he entered</p>

<p>and went to bed.   Before putting out his light he re-read Tess's</p>

<p>impassioned letter.  Sleep, however, he could not--so near her, yet</p>

<p>so far from her--and he continually lifted the window-blind and</p>

<p>regarded the backs of the opposite houses, and wondered behind which</p>

<p>of the sashes she reposed at that moment.</p>

<p>He might almost as well have sat up all night.  In the morning he</p>

<p>arose at seven, and shortly after went out, taking the direction of</p>

<p>the chief post-office.  At the door he met an intelligent postman</p>

<p>coming out with letters for the morning delivery.</p>

<p>"Do you know the address of a Mrs Clare?" asked Angel.  The postman</p>

<p>shook his head.</p>

<p>Then, remembering that she would have been likely to continue the use</p>

<p>of her maiden name, Clare said--</p>

<p>"Of a Miss Durbeyfield?"</p>

<p>"Durbeyfield?"</p>

<p>This also was strange to the postman addressed.</p>

<p>"There's visitors coming and going every day, as you know, sir," he</p>

<p>said; "and without the name of the house 'tis impossible to find</p>

<p>'em."</p>

<p>One of his comrades hastening out at that moment, the name was</p>

<p>repeated to him.</p>

<p>"I know no name of Durbeyfield; but there is the name of d'Urberville</p>

<p>at The Herons," said the second.</p>

<p>"That's it!" cried Clare, pleased to think that she had reverted to</p>

<p>the real pronunciation.  "What place is The Herons?"</p>

<p>"A stylish lodging-house.  'Tis all lodging-houses here, bless 'ee."</p>

<p>Clare received directions how to find the house, and hastened</p>

<p>thither, arriving with the milkman.  The Herons, though an ordinary</p>

<p>villa, stood in its own grounds, and was certainly the last place</p>

<p>in which one would have expected to find lodgings, so private was</p>

<p>its appearance.  If poor Tess was a servant here, as he feared, she</p>

<p>would go to the back-door to that milkman, and he was inclined to go</p>

<p>thither also.  However, in his doubts he turned to the front, and</p>

<p>rang.</p>

<p>The hour being early, the landlady herself opened the door.  Clare</p>

<p>inquired for Teresa d'Urberville or Durbeyfield.</p>

<p>"Mrs d'Urberville?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>Tess, then, passed as a married woman, and he felt glad, even though</p>

<p>she had not adopted his name.</p>

<p>"Will you kindly tell her that a relative is anxious to see her?"</p>

<p>"It is rather early.  What name shall I give, sir?"</p>

<p>"Angel."</p>

<p>"Mr Angel?"</p>

<p>"No; Angel.  It is my Christian name.  She'll understand."</p>

<p>"I'll see if she is awake."</p>

<p>He was shown into the front room--the dining-room--and looked out</p>

<p>through the spring curtains at the little lawn, and the rhododendrons</p>

<p>and other shrubs upon it.  Obviously her position was by no means so</p>

<p>bad as he had feared, and it crossed his mind that she must somehow</p>

<p>have claimed and sold the jewels to attain it.  He did not blame her</p>

<p>for one moment.  Soon his sharpened ear detected footsteps upon the</p>

<p>stairs, at which his heart thumped so painfully that he could hardly</p>

<p>stand firm.  "Dear me! what will she think of me, so altered as I</p>

<p>am!" he said to himself; and the door opened.</p>

<p>Tess appeared on the threshold--not at all as he had expected to</p>

<p>see her--bewilderingly otherwise, indeed.  Her great natural beauty</p>

<p>was, if not heightened, rendered more obvious by her attire.  She</p>

<p>was loosely wrapped in a cashmere dressing-gown of gray-white,</p>

<p>embroidered in half-mourning tints, and she wore slippers of the same</p>

<p>hue.  Her neck rose out of a frill of down, and her well-remembered</p>

<p>cable of dark-brown hair was partially coiled up in a mass at the</p>

<p>back of her head and partly hanging on her shoulder--the evident</p>

<p>result of haste.</p>

<p>He had held out his arms, but they had fallen again to his side;</p>

<p>for she had not come forward, remaining still in the opening of the</p>

<p>doorway.  Mere yellow skeleton that he was now, he felt the contrast</p>

<p>between them, and thought his appearance distasteful to her.</p>

<p>"Tess!" he said huskily, "can you forgive me for going away?  Can't</p>

<p>you--come to me?  How do you get to be--like this?"</p>

<p>"It is too late," said she, her voice sounding hard through the room,</p>

<p>her eyes shining unnaturally.</p>

<p>"I did not think rightly of you--I did not see you as you were!" he</p>

<p>continued to plead.  "I have learnt to since, dearest Tessy mine!"</p>

<p>"Too late, too late!" she said, waving her hand in the impatience of</p>

<p>a person whose tortures cause every instant to seem an hour.  "Don't</p>

<p>come close to me, Angel!  No--you must not.  Keep away."</p>

<p>"But don't you love me, my dear wife, because I have been so pulled</p>

<p>down by illness?  You are not so fickle--I am come on purpose for</p>

<p>you--my mother and father will welcome you now!"</p>

<p>"Yes--O, yes, yes!  But I say, I say it is too late."</p>

<p>She seemed to feel like a fugitive in a dream, who tries to move</p>

<p>away, but cannot.  "Don't you know all--don't you know it?  Yet how</p>

<p>do you come here if you do not know?"</p>

<p>"I inquired here and there, and I found the way."</p>

<p>"I waited and waited for you," she went on, her tones suddenly</p>

<p>resuming their old fluty pathos.  "But you did not come!  And I wrote</p>

<p>to you, and you did not come! He kept on saying you would never come</p>

<p>any more, and that I was a foolish woman.  He was very kind to me,</p>

<p>and to mother, and to all of us after father's death. He--"</p>

<p>"I don't understand."</p>

<p>"He has won me back to him."</p>

<p>Clare looked at her keenly, then, gathering her meaning, flagged</p>

<p>like one plague-stricken, and his glance sank; it fell on her hands,</p>

<p>which, once rosy, were now white and more delicate.</p>

<p>She continued--</p>

<p>"He is upstairs.  I hate him now, because he told me a lie--that you</p>

<p>would not come again; and you HAVE come!  These clothes are what he's</p>

<p>put upon me: I didn't care what he did wi' me!  But--will you go</p>

<p>away, Angel, please, and never come any more?"</p>

<p>They stood fixed, their baffled hearts looking out of their eyes with</p>

<p>a joylessness pitiful to see.  Both seemed to implore something to</p>

<p>shelter them from reality.</p>

<p>"Ah--it is my fault!" said Clare.</p>

<p>But he could not get on.  Speech was as inexpressive as silence.  But</p>

<p>he had a vague consciousness of one thing, though it was not clear</p>

<p>to him till later; that his original Tess had spiritually ceased to</p>

<p>recognize the body before him as hers--allowing it to drift, like a</p>

<p>corpse upon the current, in a direction dissociated from its living</p>

<p>will.</p>

<p>A few instants passed, and he found that Tess was gone.  His face</p>

<p>grew colder and more shrunken as he stood concentrated on the moment,</p>

<p>and a minute or two after, he found himself in the street, walking</p>

<p>along he did not know whither.</p>

<p>LVI</p>

<p>Mrs Brooks, the lady who was the householder at The Herons and owner</p>

<p>of all the handsome furniture, was not a person of an unusually</p>

<p>curious turn of mind. She was too deeply materialized, poor woman,</p>

<p>by her long and enforced bondage to that arithmetical demon</p>

<p>Profit-and-Loss, to retain much curiousity for its own sake, and</p>

<p>apart from possible lodgers' pockets.  Nevertheless, the visit of</p>

<p>Angel Clare to her well-paying tenants, Mr and Mrs d'Urberville, as</p>

<p>she deemed them, was sufficiently exceptional in point of time and</p>

<p>manner to reinvigorate the feminine proclivity which had been stifled</p>

<p>down as useless save in its bearings to the letting trade.</p>

<p>Tess had spoken to her husband from the doorway, without entering</p>

<p>the dining-room, and Mrs Brooks, who stood within the partly-closed</p>

<p>door of her own sitting-room at the back of the passage, could</p>

<p>hear fragments of the conversation--if conversation it could be</p>

<p>called--between those two wretched souls.  She heard Tess re-ascend</p>

<p>the stairs to the first floor, and the departure of Clare, and the</p>

<p>closing of the front door behind him.  Then the door of the room</p>

<p>above was shut, and Mrs Brooks knew that Tess had re-entered her</p>

<p>apartment.  As the young lady was not fully dressed, Mrs Brooks knew</p>

<p>that she would not emerge again for some time.</p>

<p>She accordingly ascended the stairs softly, and stood at the door of</p>

<p>the front room--a drawing-room, connected with the room immediately</p>

<p>behind it (which was a bedroom) by folding-doors in the common</p>

<p>manner.  This first floor, containing Mrs Brooks's best apartments,</p>

<p>had been taken by the week by the d'Urbervilles.  The back room was</p>

<p>now in silence; but from the drawing-room there came sounds.</p>

<p>All that she could at first distinguish of them was one syllable,</p>

<p>continually repeated in a low note of moaning, as if it came from a</p>

<p>soul bound to some Ixionian wheel--</p>

<p>"O--O--O!"</p>

<p>Then a silence, then a heavy sigh, and again--</p>

<p>"O--O--O!"</p>

<p>The landlady looked through the keyhole.  Only a small space of the</p>

<p>room inside was visible, but within that space came a corner of the</p>

<p>breakfast table, which was already spread for the meal, and also a</p>

<p>chair beside.  Over the seat of the chair Tess's face was bowed, her</p>

<p>posture being a kneeling one in front of it; her hands were clasped</p>

<p>over her head, the skirts of her dressing-gown and the embroidery of</p>

<p>her night-gown flowed upon the floor behind her, and her stockingless</p>

<p>feet, from which the slippers had fallen, protruded upon the carpet.</p>

<p>It was from her lips that came the murmur of unspeakable despair.</p>

<p>Then a man's voice from the adjoining bedroom--</p>

<p>"What's the matter?"</p>

<p>She did not answer, but went on, in a tone which was a soliloquy</p>

<p>rather than an exclamation, and a dirge rather than a soliloquy.</p>

<p>Mrs Brooks could only catch a portion:</p>

<p>"And then my dear, dear husband came home to me ... and I did not</p>

<p>know it! ...  And you had used your cruel persuasion upon me ... you</p>

<p>did not stop using it--no--you did not stop! My little sisters and</p>

<p>brothers and my mother's needs--they were the things you moved me</p>

<p>by ... and you said my husband would never come back--never; and you</p>

<p>taunted me, and said what a simpleton I was to expect him! ...  And</p>

<p>at last I believed you and gave way! ...  And then he came back!</p>

<p>Now he is gone.  Gone a second time, and I have lost him now</p>

<p>for ever ... and he will not love me the littlest bit ever any</p>

<p>more--only hate me! ... O yes, I have lost him now--again because</p>

<p>of--you!"  In writhing, with her head on the chair, she turned her</p>

<p>face towards the door, and Mrs Brooks could see the pain upon it,</p>

<p>and that her lips were bleeding from the clench of her teeth upon</p>

<p>them, and that the long lashes of her closed eyes stuck in wet tags</p>

<p>to her cheeks.  She continued: "And he is dying--he looks as if he</p>

<p>is dying! ...  And my sin will kill him and not kill me! ...  O, you</p>

<p>have torn my life all to pieces ... made me be what I prayed you in</p>

<p>pity not to make me be again! ...  My own true husband will never,</p>

<p>never--O God--I can't bear this!--I cannot!"</p>

<p>There were more and sharper words from the man; then a sudden rustle;</p>

<p>she had sprung to her feet.  Mrs Brooks, thinking that the speaker</p>

<p>was coming to rush out of the door, hastily retreated down the</p>

<p>stairs.</p>

<p>She need not have done so, however, for the door of the sitting-room</p>

<p>was not opened.  But Mrs Brooks felt it unsafe to watch on the</p>

<p>landing again, and entered her own parlour below.</p>

<p>She could hear nothing through the floor, although she listened</p>

<p>intently, and thereupon went to the kitchen to finish her interrupted</p>

<p>breakfast.  Coming up presently to the front room on the ground floor</p>

<p>she took up some sewing, waiting for her lodgers to ring that she</p>

<p>might take away the breakfast, which she meant to do herself, to</p>

<p>discover what was the matter if possible.  Overhead, as she sat, she</p>

<p>could now hear the floorboards slightly creak, as if some one were</p>

<p>walking about, and presently the movement was explained by the rustle</p>

<p>of garments against the banisters, the opening and the closing of</p>

<p>the front door, and the form of Tess passing to the gate on her way</p>

<p>into the street.  She was fully dressed now in the walking costume</p>

<p>of a well-to-do young lady in which she had arrived, with the sole</p>

<p>addition that over her hat and black feathers a veil was drawn.</p>

<p>Mrs Brooks had not been able to catch any word of farewell, temporary</p>

<p>or otherwise, between her tenants at the door above.  They might have</p>

<p>quarrelled, or Mr d'Urberville might still be asleep, for he was not</p>

<p>an early riser.</p>

<p>She went into the back room, which was more especially her own</p>

<p>apartment, and continued her sewing there.  The lady lodger did not</p>

<p>return, nor did the gentleman ring his bell.  Mrs Brooks pondered on</p>

<p>the delay, and on what probable relation the visitor who had called</p>

<p>so early bore to the couple upstairs.  In reflecting she leant back</p>

<p>in her chair.</p>

<p>As she did so her eyes glanced casually over the ceiling till they</p>

<p>were arrested by a spot in the middle of its white surface which she</p>

<p>had never noticed there before.  It was about the size of a wafer</p>

<p>when she first observed it, but it speedily grew as large as the palm</p>

<p>of her hand, and then she could perceive that it was red.  The oblong</p>

<p>white ceiling, with this scarlet blot in the midst, had the</p>

<p>appearance of a gigantic ace of hearts.</p>

<p>Mrs Brooks had strange qualms of misgiving.  She got upon the table,</p>

<p>and touched the spot in the ceiling with her fingers. It was damp,</p>

<p>and she fancied that it was a blood stain.</p>

<p>Descending from the table, she left the parlour, and went upstairs,</p>

<p>intending to enter the room overhead, which was the bedchamber at</p>

<p>the back of the drawing-room.  But, nerveless woman as she had now</p>

<p>become, she could not bring herself to attempt the handle.  She</p>

<p>listened.  The dead silence within was broken only by a regular beat.</p>

<p>Drip, drip, drip.</p>

<p>Mrs Brooks hastened downstairs, opened the front door, and ran into</p>

<p>the street.  A man she knew, one of the workmen employed at an</p>

<p>adjoining villa, was passing by, and she begged him to come in and go</p>

<p>upstairs with her; she feared something had happened to one of her</p>

<p>lodgers.  The workman assented, and followed her to the landing.</p>

<p>She opened the door of the drawing-room, and stood back for him</p>

<p>to pass in, entering herself behind him.  The room was empty; the</p>

<p>breakfast--a substantial repast of coffee, eggs, and a cold ham--lay</p>

<p>spread upon the table untouched, as when she had taken it up,</p>

<p>excepting that the carving-knife was missing.  She asked the man to</p>

<p>go through the folding-doors into the adjoining room.</p>

<p>He opened the doors, entered a step or two, and came back almost</p>

<p>instantly with a rigid face.  "My good God, the gentleman in bed is</p>

<p>dead!  I think he has been hurt with a knife--a lot of blood had run</p>

<p>down upon the floor!"</p>

<p>The alarm was soon given, and the house which had lately been so</p>

<p>quiet resounded with the tramp of many footsteps, a surgeon among the</p>

<p>rest.  The wound was small, but the point of the blade had touched</p>

<p>the heart of the victim, who lay on his back, pale, fixed, dead, as</p>

<p>if he had scarcely moved after the infliction of the blow.  In a</p>

<p>quarter of an hour the news that a gentleman who was a temporary</p>

<p>visitor to the town had been stabbed in his bed, spread through every</p>

<p>street and villa of the popular watering-place.</p>

<p>LVII</p>

<p>Meanwhile Angel Clare had walked automatically along the way by which</p>

<p>he had come, and, entering his hotel, sat down over the breakfast,</p>

<p>staring at nothingness.  He went on eating and drinking unconsciously</p>

<p>till on a sudden he demanded his bill; having paid which, he took his</p>

<p>dressing-bag in his hand, the only luggage he had brought with him,</p>

<p>and went out.</p>

<p>At the moment of his departure a telegram was handed to him--a few</p>

<p>words from his mother, stating that they were glad to know his</p>

<p>address, and informing him that his brother Cuthbert had proposed to</p>

<p>and been accepted by Mercy Chant.</p>

<p>Clare crumpled up the paper and followed the route to the station;</p>

<p>reaching it, he found that there would be no train leaving for an</p>

<p>hour and more.  He sat down to wait, and having waited a quarter of</p>

<p>an hour felt that he could wait there no longer.  Broken in heart and</p>

<p>numbed, he had nothing to hurry for; but he wished to get out of a</p>

<p>town which had been the scene of such an experience, and turned to</p>

<p>walk to the first station onward, and let the train pick him up</p>

<p>there.</p>

<p>The highway that he followed was open, and at a little distance</p>

<p>dipped into a valley, across which it could be seen running from edge</p>

<p>to edge.  He had traversed the greater part of this depression, and</p>

<p>was climbing the western acclivity when, pausing for breath, he</p>

<p>unconsciously looked back.  Why he did so he could not say, but</p>

<p>something seemed to impel him to the act.  The tape-like surface of</p>

<p>the road diminished in his rear as far as he could see, and as he</p>

<p>gazed a moving spot intruded on the white vacuity of its perspective.</p>

<p>It was a human figure running.  Clare waited, with a dim sense that</p>

<p>somebody was trying to overtake him.</p>

<p>The form descending the incline was a woman's, yet so entirely was</p>

<p>his mind blinded to the idea of his wife's following him that even</p>

<p>when she came nearer he did not recognize her under the totally</p>

<p>changed attire in which he now beheld her.  It was not till she was</p>

<p>quite close that he could believe her to be Tess.</p>

<p>"I saw you--turn away from the station--just before I got there--and</p>

<p>I have been following you all this way!"</p>

<p>She was so pale, so breathless, so quivering in every muscle, that he</p>

<p>did not ask her a single question, but seizing her hand, and pulling</p>

<p>it within his arm, he led her along.  To avoid meeting any possible</p>

<p>wayfarers he left the high road and took a footpath under some</p>

<p>fir-trees.  When they were deep among the moaning boughs he stopped</p>

<p>and looked at her inquiringly.</p>

<p>"Angel," she said, as if waiting for this, "do you know what I have</p>

<p>been running after you for?  To tell you that I have killed him!"</p>

<p>A pitiful white smile lit her face as she spoke.</p>

<p>"What!" said he, thinking from the strangeness of her manner that she</p>

<p>was in some delirium.</p>

<p>"I have done it--I don't know how," she continued.  "Still, I owed it</p>

<p>to you, and to myself, Angel.  I feared long ago, when I struck him</p>

<p>on the mouth with my glove, that I might do it some day for the trap</p>

<p>he set for me in my simple youth, and his wrong to you through me.</p>

<p>He has come between us and ruined us, and now he can never do it any</p>

<p>more.  I never loved him at all, Angel, as I loved you.  You know it,</p>

<p>don't you?  You believe it?  You didn't come back to me, and I was</p>

<p>obliged to go back to him.  Why did you go away--why did you--when I</p>

<p>loved you so?  I can't think why you did it.  But I don't blame you;</p>

<p>only, Angel, will you forgive me my sin against you, now I have</p>

<p>killed him?  I thought as I ran along that you would be sure to</p>

<p>forgive me now I have done that.  It came to me as a shining light</p>

<p>that I should get you back that way.  I could not bear the loss of</p>

<p>you any longer--you don't know how entirely I was unable to bear your</p>

<p>not loving me!  Say you do now, dear, dear husband; say you do, now I</p>

<p>have killed him!"</p>

<p>"I do love you, Tess--O, I do--it is all come back!" he said,</p>

<p>tightening his arms round her with fervid pressure.  "But how do you</p>

<p>mean--you have killed him?"</p>

<p>"I mean that I have," she murmured in a reverie.</p>

<p>"What, bodily?  Is he dead?"</p>

<p>"Yes.  He heard me crying about you, and he bitterly taunted me; and</p>

<p>called you by a foul name; and then I did it.  My heart could not</p>

<p>bear it.  He had nagged me about you before.  And then I dressed</p>

<p>myself and came away to find you."</p>

<p>By degrees he was inclined to believe that she had faintly attempted,</p>

<p>at least, what she said she had done; and his horror at her impulse</p>

<p>was mixed with amazement at the strength of her affection for</p>

<p>himself, and at the strangeness of its quality, which had apparently</p>

<p>extinguished her moral sense altogether.  Unable to realize the</p>

<p>gravity of her conduct, she seemed at last content; and he looked</p>

<p>at her as she lay upon his shoulder, weeping with happiness, and</p>

<p>wondered what obscure strain in the d'Urberville blood had led to</p>

<p>this aberration--if it were an aberration.  There momentarily flashed</p>

<p>through his mind that the family tradition of the coach and murder</p>

<p>might have arisen because the d'Urbervilles had been known to do</p>

<p>these things.  As well as his confused and excited ideas could</p>

<p>reason, he supposed that in the moment of mad grief of which she</p>

<p>spoke, her mind had lost its balance, and plunged her into this</p>

<p>abyss.</p>

<p>It was very terrible if true; if a temporary hallucination, sad.  But,</p>

<p>anyhow, here was this deserted wife of his, this passionately-fond</p>

<p>woman, clinging to him without a suspicion that he would be anything</p>

<p>to her but a protector.  He saw that for him to be otherwise was</p>

<p>not, in her mind, within the region of the possible.  Tenderness was</p>

<p>absolutely dominant in Clare at last.  He kissed her endlessly with</p>

<p>his white lips, and held her hand, and said--</p>

<p>"I will not desert you!  I will protect you by every means in my</p>

<p>power, dearest love, whatever you may have done or not have done!"</p>

<p>They then walked on under the trees, Tess turning her head every now</p>

<p>and then to look at him.  Worn and unhandsome as he had become, it</p>

<p>was plain that she did not discern the least fault in his appearance.</p>

<p>To her he was, as of old, all that was perfection, personally and</p>

<p>mentally.  He was still her Antinous, her Apollo even; his sickly</p>

<p>face was beautiful as the morning to her affectionate regard on</p>

<p>this day no less than when she first beheld him; for was it not the</p>

<p>face of the one man on earth who had loved her purely, and who had</p>

<p>believed in her as pure!</p>

<p>With an instinct as to possibilities, he did not now, as he had</p>

<p>intended, make for the first station beyond the town, but plunged</p>

<p>still farther under the firs, which here abounded for miles.  Each</p>

<p>clasping the other round the waist they promenaded over the dry bed</p>

<p>of fir-needles, thrown into a vague intoxicating atmosphere at the</p>

<p>consciousness of being together at last, with no living soul between</p>

<p>them; ignoring that there was a corpse.  Thus they proceeded for</p>

<p>several miles till Tess, arousing herself, looked about her, and</p>

<p>said, timidly--</p>

<p>"Are we going anywhere in particular?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, dearest.  Why?"</p>

<p>"I don't know."</p>

<p>"Well, we might walk a few miles further, and when it is evening find</p>

<p>lodgings somewhere or other--in a lonely cottage, perhaps.  Can you</p>

<p>walk well, Tessy?"</p>

<p>"O yes!  I could walk for ever and ever with your arm round me!"</p>

<p>Upon the whole it seemed a good thing to do.  Thereupon they</p>

<p>quickened their pace, avoiding high roads, and following obscure</p>

<p>paths tending more or less northward.  But there was an unpractical</p>

<p>vagueness in their movements throughout the day; neither one of them</p>

<p>seemed to consider any question of effectual escape, disguise, or</p>

<p>long concealment.  Their every idea was temporary and unforefending,</p>

<p>like the plans of two children.</p>

<p>At mid-day they drew near to a roadside inn, and Tess would have</p>

<p>entered it with him to get something to eat, but he persuaded</p>

<p>her to remain among the trees and bushes of this half-woodland,</p>

<p>half-moorland part of the country till he should come back.  Her</p>

<p>clothes were of recent fashion; even the ivory-handled parasol that</p>

<p>she carried was of a shape unknown in the retired spot to which they</p>

<p>had now wandered; and the cut of such articles would have attracted</p>

<p>attention in the settle of a tavern.  He soon returned, with food</p>

<p>enough for half-a-dozen people and two bottles of wine--enough to</p>

<p>last them for a day or more, should any emergency arise.</p>

<p>They sat down upon some dead boughs and shared their meal.  Between</p>

<p>one and two o'clock they packed up the remainder and went on again.</p>

<p>"I feel strong enough to walk any distance," said she.</p>

<p>"I think we may as well steer in a general way towards the interior</p>

<p>of the country, where we can hide for a time, and are less likely to</p>

<p>be looked for than anywhere near the coast," Clare remarked.  "Later</p>

<p>on, when they have forgotten us, we can make for some port."</p>

<p>She made no reply to this beyond that of grasping him more tightly,</p>

<p>and straight inland they went.  Though the season was an English May,</p>

<p>the weather was serenely bright, and during the afternoon it was</p>

<p>quite warm.  Through the latter miles of their walk their footpath</p>

<p>had taken them into the depths of the New Forest, and towards</p>

<p>evening, turning the corner of a lane, they perceived behind a brook</p>

<p>and bridge a large board on which was painted in white letters, "This</p>

<p>desirable Mansion to be Let Furnished"; particulars following, with</p>

<p>directions to apply to some London agents.  Passing through the gate</p>

<p>they could see the house, an old brick building of regular design and</p>

<p>large accommodation.</p>

<p>"I know it," said Clare.  "It is Bramshurst Court.  You can see that</p>

<p>it is shut up, and grass is growing on the drive."</p>

<p>"Some of the windows are open," said Tess.</p>

<p>"Just to air the rooms, I suppose."</p>

<p>"All these rooms empty, and we without a roof to our heads!"</p>

<p>"You are getting tired, my Tess!" he said.  "We'll stop soon."  And</p>

<p>kissing her sad mouth, he again led her onwards.</p>

<p>He was growing weary likewise, for they had wandered a dozen or</p>

<p>fifteen miles, and it became necessary to consider what they should</p>

<p>do for rest.  They looked from afar at isolated cottages and little</p>

<p>inns, and were inclined to approach one of the latter, when their</p>

<p>hearts failed them, and they sheered off.  At length their gait</p>

<p>dragged, and they stood still.</p>

<p>"Could we sleep under the trees?" she asked.</p>

<p>He thought the season insufficiently advanced.</p>

<p>"I have been thinking of that empty mansion we passed," he said.</p>

<p>"Let us go back towards it again."</p>

<p>They retraced their steps, but it was half an hour before they stood</p>

<p>without the entrance-gate as earlier.  He then requested her to stay</p>

<p>where she was, whilst he went to see who was within.</p>

<p>She sat down among the bushes within the gate, and Clare crept</p>

<p>towards the house.  His absence lasted some considerable time, and</p>

<p>when he returned Tess was wildly anxious, not for herself, but for</p>

<p>him.  He had found out from a boy that there was only an old woman in</p>

<p>charge as caretaker, and she only came there on fine days, from the</p>

<p>hamlet near, to open and shut the windows.  She would come to shut</p>

<p>them at sunset.  "Now, we can get in through one of the lower</p>

<p>windows, and rest there," said he.</p>

<p>Under his escort she went tardily forward to the main front, whose</p>

<p>shuttered windows, like sightless eyeballs, excluded the possibility</p>

<p>of watchers.  The door was reached a few steps further, and one of</p>

<p>the windows beside it was open. Clare clambered in, and pulled Tess</p>

<p>in after him.</p>

<p>Except the hall, the rooms were all in darkness, and they ascended</p>

<p>the staircase.  Up here also the shutters were tightly closed,</p>

<p>the ventilation being perfunctorily done, for this day at least,</p>

<p>by opening the hall-window in front and an upper window behind.</p>

<p>Clare unlatched the door of a large chamber, felt his way across</p>

<p>it, and parted the shutters to the width of two or three inches.</p>

<p>A shaft of dazzling sunlight glanced into the room, revealing heavy,</p>

<p>old-fashioned furniture, crimson damask hangings, and an enormous</p>

<p>four-post bedstead, along the head of which were carved running</p>

<p>figures, apparently Atalanta's race.</p>

<p>"Rest at last!" said he, setting down his bag and the parcel of</p>

<p>viands.</p>

<p>They remained in great quietness till the caretaker should have come</p>

<p>to shut the windows: as a precaution, putting themselves in total</p>

<p>darkness by barring the shutters as before, lest the woman should</p>

<p>open the door of their chamber for any casual reason.  Between six</p>

<p>and seven o'clock she came, but did not approach the wing they</p>

<p>were in.  They heard her close the windows, fasten them, lock the</p>

<p>door, and go away.  Then Clare again stole a chink of light from</p>

<p>the window, and they shared another meal, till by-and-by they</p>

<p>were enveloped in the shades of night which they had no candle to</p>

<p>disperse.</p>

<p>LVIII</p>

<p>The night was strangely solemn and still.  In the small hours she</p>

<p>whispered to him the whole story of how he had walked in his sleep</p>

<p>with her in his arms across the Froom stream, at the imminent risk of</p>

<p>both their lives, and laid her down in the stone coffin at the ruined</p>

<p>abbey.  He had never known of that till now.</p>

<p>"Why didn't you tell me next day?" he said.  "It might have prevented</p>

<p>much misunderstanding and woe."</p>

<p>"Don't think of what's past!" said she.  "I am not going to think</p>

<p>outside of now.  Why should we!  Who knows what to-morrow has in</p>

<p>store?"</p>

<p>But it apparently had no sorrow.  The morning was wet and foggy, and</p>

<p>Clare, rightly informed that the caretaker only opened the windows</p>

<p>on fine days, ventured to creep out of their chamber and explore the</p>

<p>house, leaving Tess asleep.  There was no food on the premises, but</p>

<p>there was water, and he took advantage of the fog to emerge from the</p>

<p>mansion and fetch tea, bread, and butter from a shop in a little</p>

<p>place two miles beyond, as also a small tin kettle and spirit-lamp,</p>

<p>that they might get fire without smoke.  His re-entry awoke her; and</p>

<p>they breakfasted on what he had brought.</p>

<p>They were indisposed to stir abroad, and the day passed, and the</p>

<p>night following, and the next, and next; till, almost without their</p>

<p>being aware, five days had slipped by in absolute seclusion, not a</p>

<p>sight or sound of a human being disturbing their peacefulness, such</p>

<p>as it was.  The changes of the weather were their only events, the</p>

<p>birds of the New Forest their only company.  By tacit consent they</p>

<p>hardly once spoke of any incident of the past subsequent to their</p>

<p>wedding-day.  The gloomy intervening time seemed to sink into chaos,</p>

<p>over which the present and prior times closed as if it never had</p>

<p>been.  Whenever he suggested that they should leave their shelter,</p>

<p>and go forwards towards Southampton or London, she showed a strange</p>

<p>unwillingness to move.</p>

<p>"Why should we put an end to all that's sweet and lovely!" she</p>

<p>deprecated.  "What must come will come."  And, looking through the</p>

<p>shutter-chink: "All is trouble outside there; inside here content."</p>

<p>He peeped out also.  It was quite true; within was affection, union,</p>

<p>error forgiven: outside was the inexorable.</p>

<p>"And--and," she said, pressing her cheek against his, "I fear that</p>

<p>what you think of me now may not last.  I do not wish to outlive your</p>

<p>present feeling for me. I would rather not.  I would rather be dead</p>

<p>and buried when the time comes for you to despise me, so that it may</p>

<p>never be known to me that you despised me."</p>

<p>"I cannot ever despise you."</p>

<p>"I also hope that.  But considering what my life has been, I cannot</p>

<p>see why any man should, sooner or later, be able to help despising</p>

<p>me....  How wickedly mad I was!  Yet formerly I never could bear to</p>

<p>hurt a fly or a worm, and the sight of a bird in a cage used often to</p>

<p>make me cry."</p>

<p>They remained yet another day.  In the night the dull sky cleared,</p>

<p>and the result was that the old caretaker at the cottage awoke early.</p>

<p>The brilliant sunrise made her unusually brisk; she decided to open</p>

<p>the contiguous mansion immediately, and to air it thoroughly on such</p>

<p>a day.  Thus it occurred that, having arrived and opened the lower</p>

<p>rooms before six o'clock, she ascended to the bedchambers, and was</p>

<p>about to turn the handle of the one wherein they lay.  At that moment</p>

<p>she fancied she could hear the breathing of persons within.  Her</p>

<p>slippers and her antiquity had rendered her progress a noiseless one</p>

<p>so far, and she made for instant retreat; then, deeming that her</p>

<p>hearing might have deceived her, she turned anew to the door and</p>

<p>softly tried the handle.  The lock was out of order, but a piece of</p>

<p>furniture had been moved forward on the inside, which prevented her</p>

<p>opening the door more than an inch or two.  A stream of morning light</p>

<p>through the shutter-chink fell upon the faces of the pair, wrapped in</p>

<p>profound slumber, Tess's lips being parted like a half-opened flower</p>

<p>near his cheek.  The caretaker was so struck with their innocent</p>

<p>appearance, and with the elegance of Tess's gown hanging across a</p>

<p>chair, her silk stockings beside it, the pretty parasol, and the</p>

<p>other habits in which she had arrived because she had none else, that</p>

<p>her first indignation at the effrontery of tramps and vagabonds gave</p>

<p>way to a momentary sentimentality over this genteel elopement, as it</p>

<p>seemed.  She closed the door, and withdrew as softly as she had come,</p>

<p>to go and consult with her neighbours on the odd discovery.</p>

<p>Not more than a minute had elapsed after her withdrawal when Tess</p>

<p>woke, and then Clare.  Both had a sense that something had disturbed</p>

<p>them, though they could not say what; and the uneasy feeling which</p>

<p>it engendered grew stronger.  As soon as he was dressed he narrowly</p>

<p>scanned the lawn through the two or three inches of shutter-chink.</p>

<p>"I think we will leave at once," said he.  "It is a fine day. And I</p>

<p>cannot help fancying somebody is about the house.  At any rate, the</p>

<p>woman will be sure to come to-day."</p>

<p>She passively assented, and putting the room in order, they took up</p>

<p>the few articles that belonged to them, and departed noiselessly.</p>

<p>When they had got into the Forest she turned to take a last look at</p>

<p>the house.</p>

<p>"Ah, happy house--goodbye!" she said.  "My life can only be a</p>

<p>question of a few weeks.  Why should we not have stayed there?"</p>

<p>"Don't say it, Tess!  We shall soon get out of this district</p>

<p>altogether.  We'll continue our course as we've begun it, and keep</p>

<p>straight north.  Nobody will think of looking for us there.  We shall</p>

<p>be looked for at the Wessex ports if we are sought at all.  When we</p>

<p>are in the north we will get to a port and away."</p>

<p>Having thus persuaded her, the plan was pursued, and they kept a</p>

<p>bee-line northward.  Their long repose at the manor-house lent them</p>

<p>walking power now; and towards mid-day they found that they were</p>

<p>approaching the steepled city of Melchester, which lay directly in</p>

<p>their way.  He decided to rest her in a clump of trees during the</p>

<p>afternoon, and push onward under cover of darkness.  At dusk Clare</p>

<p>purchased food as usual, and their night march began, the boundary</p>

<p>between Upper and Mid-Wessex being crossed about eight o'clock.</p>

<p>To walk across country without much regard to roads was not new</p>

<p>to Tess, and she showed her old agility in the performance.  The</p>

<p>intercepting city, ancient Melchester, they were obliged to pass</p>

<p>through in order to take advantage of the town bridge for crossing a</p>

<p>large river that obstructed them.  It was about midnight when they</p>

<p>went along the deserted streets, lighted fitfully by the few lamps,</p>

<p>keeping off the pavement that it might not echo their footsteps.</p>

<p>The graceful pile of cathedral architecture rose dimly on their left</p>

<p>hand, but it was lost upon them now.  Once out of the town they</p>

<p>followed the turnpike-road, which after a few miles plunged across an</p>

<p>open plain.</p>

<p>Though the sky was dense with cloud, a diffused light from some</p>

<p>fragment of a moon had hitherto helped them a little.  But the moon</p>

<p>had now sunk, the clouds seemed to settle almost on their heads, and</p>

<p>the night grew as dark as a cave.  However, they found their way</p>

<p>along, keeping as much on the turf as possible that their tread might</p>

<p>not resound, which it was easy to do, there being no hedge or fence</p>

<p>of any kind.  All around was open loneliness and black solitude, over</p>

<p>which a stiff breeze blew.</p>

<p>They had proceeded thus gropingly two or three miles further when</p>

<p>on a sudden Clare became conscious of some vast erection close in</p>

<p>his front, rising sheer from the grass.  They had almost struck</p>

<p>themselves against it.</p>

<p>"What monstrous place is this?" said Angel.</p>

<p>"It hums," said she.  "Hearken!"</p>

<p>He listened.  The wind, playing upon the edifice, produced a booming</p>

<p>tune, like the note of some gigantic one-stringed harp.  No other</p>

<p>sound came from it, and lifting his hand and advancing a step or</p>

<p>two, Clare felt the vertical surface of the structure.  It seemed to</p>

<p>be of solid stone, without joint or moulding.  Carrying his fingers</p>

<p>onward he found that what he had come in contact with was a colossal</p>

<p>rectangular pillar; by stretching out his left hand he could feel a</p>

<p>similar one adjoining.  At an indefinite height overhead something</p>

<p>made the black sky blacker, which had the semblance of a vast</p>

<p>architrave uniting the pillars horizontally.  They carefully entered</p>

<p>beneath and between; the surfaces echoed their soft rustle; but they</p>

<p>seemed to be still out of doors.  The place was roofless.  Tess drew</p>

<p>her breath fearfully, and Angel, perplexed, said--</p>

<p>"What can it be?"</p>

<p>Feeling sideways they encountered another tower-like pillar, square</p>

<p>and uncompromising as the first; beyond it another and another.  The</p>

<p>place was all doors and pillars, some connected above by continuous</p>

<p>architraves.</p>

<p>"A very Temple of the Winds," he said.</p>

<p>The next pillar was isolated; others composed a trilithon; others</p>

<p>were prostrate, their flanks forming a causeway wide enough for a</p>

<p>carriage; and it was soon obvious that they made up a forest of</p>

<p>monoliths grouped upon the grassy expanse of the plain.  The couple</p>

<p>advanced further into this pavilion of the night till they stood in</p>

<p>its midst.</p>

<p>"It is Stonehenge!" said Clare.</p>

<p>"The heathen temple, you mean?"</p>

<p>"Yes.  Older than the centuries; older than the d'Urbervilles!  Well,</p>

<p>what shall we do, darling?  We may find shelter further on."</p>

<p>But Tess, really tired by this time, flung herself upon an oblong</p>

<p>slab that lay close at hand, and was sheltered from the wind by a</p>

<p>pillar.  Owing to the action of the sun during the preceding day, the</p>

<p>stone was warm and dry, in comforting contrast to the rough and chill</p>

<p>grass around, which had damped her skirts and shoes.</p>

<p>"I don't want to go any further, Angel," she said, stretching out her</p>

<p>hand for his.  "Can't we bide here?"</p>

<p>"I fear not.  This spot is visible for miles by day, although it does</p>

<p>not seem so now."</p>

<p>"One of my mother's people was a shepherd hereabouts, now I think of</p>

<p>it.  And you used to say at Talbothays that I was a heathen.  So now</p>

<p>I am at home."</p>

<p>He knelt down beside her outstretched form, and put his lips upon</p>

<p>hers.</p>

<p>"Sleepy are you, dear?  I think you are lying on an altar."</p>

<p>"I like very much to be here," she murmured.  "It is so solemn and</p>

<p>lonely--after my great happiness--with nothing but the sky above my</p>

<p>face.  It seems as if there were no folk in the world but we two;</p>

<p>and I wish there were not--except 'Liza-Lu."</p>

<p>Clare though she might as well rest here till it should get a little</p>

<p>lighter, and he flung his overcoat upon her, and sat down by her</p>

<p>side.</p>

<p>"Angel, if anything happens to me, will you watch over 'Liza-Lu for</p>

<p>my sake?" she asked, when they had listened a long time to the wind</p>

<p>among the pillars.</p>

<p>"I will."</p>

<p>"She is so good and simple and pure.  O, Angel--I wish you would</p>

<p>marry her if you lose me, as you will do shortly.  O, if you would!"</p>

<p>"If I lose you I lose all!  And she is my sister-in-law."</p>

<p>"That's nothing, dearest.  People marry sister-laws continually about</p>

<p>Marlott; and 'Liza-Lu is so gentle and sweet, and she is growing</p>

<p>so beautiful.  O, I could share you with her willingly when we are</p>

<p>spirits!  If you would train her and teach her, Angel, and bring her</p>

<p>up for your own self! ...  She had all the best of me without the bad</p>

<p>of me; and if she were to become yours it would almost seem as if</p>

<p>death had not divided us...  Well, I have said it.  I won't mention</p>

<p>it again."</p>

<p>She ceased, and he fell into thought.  In the far north-east sky he</p>

<p>could see between the pillars a level streak of light.  The uniform</p>

<p>concavity of black cloud was lifting bodily like the lid of a pot,</p>

<p>letting in at the earth's edge the coming day, against which the</p>

<p>towering monoliths and trilithons began to be blackly defined.</p>

<p>"Did they sacrifice to God here?" asked she.</p>

<p>"No," said he.</p>

<p>"Who to?"</p>

<p>"I believe to the sun.  That lofty stone set away by itself is in the</p>

<p>direction of the sun, which will presently rise behind it."</p>

<p>"This reminds me, dear," she said.  "You remember you never would</p>

<p>interfere with any belief of mine before we were married?  But I knew</p>

<p>your mind all the same, and I thought as you thought--not from any</p>

<p>reasons of my own, but because you thought so.  Tell me now, Angel,</p>

<p>do you think we shall meet again after we are dead?  I want to know."</p>

<p>He kissed her to avoid a reply at such a time.</p>

<p>"O, Angel--I fear that means no!" said she, with a suppressed sob.</p>

<p>"And I wanted so to see you again--so much, so much!  What--not even</p>

<p>you and I, Angel, who love each other so well?"</p>

<p>Like a greater than himself, to the critical question at the critical</p>

<p>time he did not answer; and they were again silent.  In a minute or</p>

<p>two her breathing became more regular, her clasp of his hand relaxed,</p>

<p>and she fell asleep.  The band of silver paleness along the east</p>

<p>horizon made even the distant parts of the Great Plain appear dark</p>

<p>and near; and the whole enormous landscape bore that impress of</p>

<p>reserve, taciturnity, and hesitation which is usual just before day.</p>

<p>The eastward pillars and their architraves stood up blackly against</p>

<p>the light, and the great flame-shaped Sun-stone beyond them; and the</p>

<p>Stone of Sacrifice midway.  Presently the night wind died out, and</p>

<p>the quivering little pools in the cup-like hollows of the stones lay</p>

<p>still.  At the same time something seemed to move on the verge of the</p>

<p>dip eastward--a mere dot.  It was the head of a man approaching them</p>

<p>from the hollow beyond the Sun-stone.  Clare wished they had gone</p>

<p>onward, but in the circumstances decided to remain quiet.  The figure</p>

<p>came straight towards the circle of pillars in which they were.</p>

<p>He heard something behind him, the brush of feet.  Turning, he saw</p>

<p>over the prostrate columns another figure; then before he was aware,</p>

<p>another was at hand on the right, under a trilithon, and another on</p>

<p>the left.  The dawn shone full on the front of the man westward, and</p>

<p>Clare could discern from this that he was tall, and walked as if</p>

<p>trained.  They all closed in with evident purpose.  Her story then</p>

<p>was true!  Springing to his feet, he looked around for a weapon,</p>

<p>loose stone, means of escape, anything.  By this time the nearest</p>

<p>man was upon him.</p>

<p>"It is no use, sir," he said.  "There are sixteen of us on the Plain,</p>

<p>and the whole country is reared."</p>

<p>"Let her finish her sleep!" he implored in a whisper of the men as</p>

<p>they gathered round.</p>

<p>When they saw where she lay, which they had not done till then, they</p>

<p>showed no objection, and stood watching her, as still as the pillars</p>

<p>around.  He went to the stone and bent over her, holding one poor</p>

<p>little hand; her breathing now was quick and small, like that of a</p>

<p>lesser creature than a woman.  All waited in the growing light, their</p>

<p>faces and hands as if they were silvered, the remainder of their</p>

<p>figures dark, the stones glistening green-gray, the Plain still a</p>

<p>mass of shade.  Soon the light was strong, and a ray shone upon her</p>

<p>unconscious form, peering under her eyelids and waking her.</p>

<p>"What is it, Angel?" she said, starting up.  "Have they come for me?"</p>

<p>"Yes, dearest," he said.  "They have come."</p>

<p>"It is as it should be," she murmured.  "Angel, I am almost glad--yes,</p>

<p>glad!  This happiness could not have lasted.  It was too much.  I</p>

<p>have had enough; and now I shall not live for you to despise me!"</p>

<p>She stood up, shook herself, and went forward, neither of the men</p>

<p>having moved.</p>

<p>"I am ready," she said quietly.</p>

<p>LIX</p>

<p>The city of Wintoncester, that fine old city, aforetime capital</p>

<p>of Wessex, lay amidst its convex and concave downlands in all the</p>

<p>brightness and warmth of a July morning.  The gabled brick, tile, and</p>

<p>freestone houses had almost dried off for the season their integument</p>

<p>of lichen, the streams in the meadows were low, and in the sloping</p>

<p>High Street, from the West Gateway to the mediжval cross, and from</p>

<p>the mediжval cross to the bridge, that leisurely dusting and sweeping</p>

<p>was in progress which usually ushers in an old-fashioned market-day.</p>

<p>From the western gate aforesaid the highway, as every Wintoncestrian</p>

<p>knows, ascends a long and regular incline of the exact length of a</p>

<p>measured mile, leaving the houses gradually behind.  Up this road</p>

<p>from the precincts of the city two persons were walking rapidly,</p>

<p>as if unconscious of the trying ascent--unconscious through</p>

<p>preoccupation and not through buoyancy.  They had emerged upon this</p>

<p>road through a narrow, barred wicket in a high wall a little lower</p>

<p>down.  They seemed anxious to get out of the sight of the houses and</p>

<p>of their kind, and this road appeared to offer the quickest means</p>

<p>of doing so.  Though they were young, they walked with bowed heads,</p>

<p>which gait of grief the sun's rays smiled on pitilessly.</p>

<p>One of the pair was Angel Clare, the other a tall budding</p>

<p>creature--half girl, half woman--a spiritualized image of Tess,</p>

<p>slighter than she, but with the same beautiful eyes--Clare's</p>

<p>sister-in-law, 'Liza-Lu.  Their pale faces seemed to have shrunk</p>

<p>to half their natural size.  They moved on hand in hand, and never</p>

<p>spoke a word, the drooping of their heads being that of Giotto's</p>

<p>"Two Apostles".</p>

<p>When they had nearly reached the top of the great West Hill the</p>

<p>clocks in the town struck eight.  Each gave a start at the notes,</p>

<p>and, walking onward yet a few steps, they reached the first</p>

<p>milestone, standing whitely on the green margin of the grass, and</p>

<p>backed by the down, which here was open to the road.  They entered</p>

<p>upon the turf, and, impelled by a force that seemed to overrule their</p>

<p>will, suddenly stood still, turned, and waited in paralyzed suspense</p>

<p>beside the stone.</p>

<p>The prospect from this summit was almost unlimited.  In the valley</p>

<p>beneath lay the city they had just left, its more prominent buildings</p>

<p>showing as in an isometric drawing--among them the broad cathedral</p>

<p>tower, with its Norman windows and immense length of aisle and nave,</p>

<p>the spires of St Thomas's, the pinnacled tower of the College, and,</p>

<p>more to the right, the tower and gables of the ancient hospice,</p>

<p>where to this day the pilgrim may receive his dole of bread and ale.</p>

<p>Behind the city swept the rotund upland of St Catherine's Hill;</p>

<p>further off, landscape beyond landscape, till the horizon was lost</p>

<p>in the radiance of the sun hanging above it.</p>

<p>Against these far stretches of country rose, in front of the other</p>

<p>city edifices, a large red-brick building, with level gray roofs,</p>

<p>and rows of short barred windows bespeaking captivity, the whole</p>

<p>contrasting greatly by its formalism with the quaint irregularities</p>

<p>of the Gothic erections.  It was somewhat disguised from the road in</p>

<p>passing it by yews and evergreen oaks, but it was visible enough up</p>

<p>here.  The wicket from which the pair had lately emerged was in the</p>

<p>wall of this structure.  From the middle of the building an ugly</p>

<p>flat-topped octagonal tower ascended against the east horizon, and</p>

<p>viewed from this spot, on its shady side and against the light, it</p>

<p>seemed the one blot on the city's beauty.  Yet it was with this blot,</p>

<p>and not with the beauty, that the two gazers were concerned.</p>

<p>Upon the cornice of the tower a tall staff was fixed.  Their eyes</p>

<p>were riveted on it.  A few minutes after the hour had struck</p>

<p>something moved slowly up the staff, and extended itself upon the</p>

<p>breeze.  It was a black flag.</p>

<p>"Justice" was done, and the President of the Immortals, in Aeschylean</p>

<p>phrase, had ended his sport with Tess.  And the d'Urberville knights</p>

<p>and dames slept on in their tombs unknowing.  The two speechless</p>

<p>gazers bent themselves down to the earth, as if in prayer, and</p>

<p>remained thus a long time, absolutely motionless: the flag continued</p>

<p>to wave silently.  As soon as they had strength, they arose, joined</p>

<p>hands again, and went on.</p>

<p>THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE</p>

<p>PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK</p>

<p>To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free</p>

<p>distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work</p>

<p>(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project</p>

<p>Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project</p>

<p>Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at</p>

<p>http://gutenberg.net/license).</p>

<p>Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm</p>

<p>electronic works</p>

<p>1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm</p>

<p>electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to</p>

<p>and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property</p>

<p>(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all</p>

<p>the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy</p>

<p>all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.</p>

<p>If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project</p>

<p>Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the</p>

<p>terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or</p>

<p>entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.</p>

<p>1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be</p>

<p>used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who</p>

<p>agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few</p>

<p>things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works</p>

<p>even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See</p>

<p>paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project</p>

<p>Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement</p>

<p>and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic</p>

<p>works.  See paragraph 1.E below.</p>

<p>1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"</p>

<p>or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project</p>

<p>Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the</p>

<p>collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an</p>

<p>individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are</p>

<p>located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from</p>

<p>copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative</p>

<p>works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg</p>

<p>are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project</p>

<p>Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by</p>

<p>freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of</p>

<p>this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with</p>

<p>the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by</p>

<p>keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project</p>

<p>Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.</p>

<p>1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern</p>

<p>what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in</p>

<p>a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check</p>

<p>the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement</p>

<p>before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or</p>

<p>creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project</p>

<p>Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning</p>

<p>the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United</p>

<p>States.</p>

<p>Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,</p>

<p>copied or distributed:</p>

<p>This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with</p>

<p>almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or</p>

<p>re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included</p>

<p>with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net</p>

<p>1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived</p>

<p>from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is</p>

<p>posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied</p>

<p>and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees</p>

<p>or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work</p>

<p>with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the</p>

<p>work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1</p>

<p>through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or</p>

<p>1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted</p>

<p>with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution</p>

<p>electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without</p>

<p>prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with</p>

<p>compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any</p>

<p>word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or</p>

<p>distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than</p>

<p>"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version</p>

<p>posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),</p>

<p>you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a</p>

<p>copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon</p>

<p>request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other</p>

<p>form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm</p>

<p>License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.</p>

<p>1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,</p>

<p>performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works</p>

<p>unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from</p>

<p>     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method</p>

<p>     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is</p>

<p>     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he</p>

<p>     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the</p>

<p>     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments</p>

<p>     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you</p>

<p>     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax</p>

<p>     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and</p>

<p>     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the</p>

<p>     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to</p>

<p>     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."</p>

<p>- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies</p>

<p>     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he</p>

<p>     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm</p>

<p>     License.  You must require such a user to return or</p>

<p>     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium</p>

<p>     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of</p>

<p>     Project Gutenberg-tm works.</p>

<p>- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any</p>

<p>     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the</p>

<p>     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days</p>

<p>     of receipt of the work.</p>

<p>- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free</p>

<p>     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.</p>

<p>1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm</p>

<p>electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set</p>

<p>forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from</p>

<p>both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael</p>

<p>Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the</p>

<p>Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.</p>

<p>1.F.</p>

<p>1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable</p>

<p>effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread</p>

<p>public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm</p>

<p>collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic</p>

<p>works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain</p>

<p>"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or</p>

<p>corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual</p>

<p>property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a</p>

<p>computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by</p>

<p>your equipment.</p>

<p>1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right</p>

<p>of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project</p>

<p>Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project</p>

<p>Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project</p>

<p>Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all</p>

<p>liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal</p>

<p>fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT</p>

<p>LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE</p>

<p>PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE</p>

<p>TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE</p>

<p>LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR</p>

<p>INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH</p>

<p>DAMAGE.</p>

<p>1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a</p>

<p>defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can</p>

<p>receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a</p>

<p>written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you</p>

<p>received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with</p>

<p>your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with</p>

<p>the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a</p>

<p>refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity</p>

<p>providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to</p>

<p>receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy</p>

<p>is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further</p>

<p>opportunities to fix the problem.</p>

<p>1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth</p>

<p>in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER</p>

<p>WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO</p>

<p>WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.</p>

<p>1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied</p>

<p>warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.</p>

<p>If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the</p>

<p>law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be</p>

<p>interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by</p>

<p>the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any</p>

<p>provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.</p>

<p>1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the</p>

<p>trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone</p>

<p>providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance</p>

<p>with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,</p>

<p>promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,</p>

<p>harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,</p>

<p>that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do</p>

<p>or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm</p>

<p>work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.</p>

<p>Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of</p>

<p>electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers</p>

<p>including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists</p>

<p>because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from</p>

<p>people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the</p>

<p>assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's</p>

<p>goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will</p>

<p>remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project</p>

<p>Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure</p>

<p>and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.</p>

<p>To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation</p>

<p>and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4</p>

<p>Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg</p>

<p>Literary Archive Foundation</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide</p>

<p>spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of</p>

<p>increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be</p>

<p>freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest</p>

<p>array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations</p>

<p>($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt</p>

<p>status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating</p>

<p>charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United</p>

<p>States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a</p>

<p>considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up</p>

<p>with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations</p>

<p>where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To</p>

<p>SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any</p>

<p>particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/donate</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we</p>

<p>have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition</p>

<p>against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who</p>

<p>approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make</p>

<p>any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from</p>

<p>outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation</p>

<p>methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other</p>

<p>ways including including checks, online payments and credit card</p>

<p>donations.  To donate, please visit:</p>

<p>http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/donate</p>

<p>Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic</p>

<p>works.</p>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm</p>

<p>concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared</p>

<p>with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project</p>

<p>Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed</p>

<p>editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.</p>

<p>unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily</p>

<p>keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:</p>

<p>     http://www.gutenberg.net</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,</p>

<p>including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary</p>

<p>Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to</p>

<p>subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
