<p><strong>Queer</strong></p>

<p><strong>by William S. Burroughs</strong></p>

<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>

<p>When I lived in Mexico City at the end of the 1940's, it was a city of one million people, with clear sparkling air and the sky that special shade of blue that goes so well with circling vultures, blood and  sand—the  raw  menacing  pitiless  Mexican  blue.  I  liked  Mexico  City  from  the  first  day  of  my first  visit  there.  In  1949,  it  was  a  cheap  place  to  live,  with  a  large  foreign  colony,  fabulous whorehouses  and  restaurants,  cockfights  and  bullfights,  and  every  conceivable  diversion.  A single  man  could  live  well  there  for  two  dollars  a  day.  My  New  Orleans  case  for  heroin  and marijuana possession looked so unpromising that I decided not to show up for the court date, and I rented an apartment in a quiet, middle-class neighborhood of Mexico City.</p>

<p>I knew that under the statute of limitations I could not return to the United States for five years, so I  applied  for  Mexican  citizenship  and  enrolled  in  some  courses  in  Mayan  and  Mexican archaeology at  Mexico  City  College. The  G.I.  Bill  paid  for  my books  and tuition,  and  a  seventy-five-dollar-per-month living allowance. I thought I might go into farming, or perhaps open a bar on the American border.</p>

<p>The City appealed to me. The slum areas compared favorably with anything in Asia for sheer filth and  poverty.  People  would  shit  all  over  the  street,  then  lie  down  and  sleep  in  it  with  the  flies crawling  in  and  out  of  their  mouths.  Entrepreneurs,  not  infrequently  lepers,  built  fires  on  street corners  and  cooked  up  hideous,  stinking,  nameless  messes  of  food,  which  they  dispensed  to passersby. Drunks slept right on the sidewalks  of the main drag,  and no cops bothered  them.  It seemed  to me  that  everyone  in  Mexico  had  mastered  the  art  of  minding  his  own  business.  If  a man wanted to wear a monocle or carry a cane, he did not hesitate to do it, and no one gave him a second glance. Boys and young men walked down the street arm in arm and no one paid them any  mind.  It  wasn't  that  people  didn't  care  what  others  thought;  it  simply  would  not  occur  to  a Mexican to expect criticism from a stranger, nor to criticize the behavior of others.</p>

<p>Mexico was basically an Oriental culture that reflected two thousand years of disease and poverty and degradation and stupidity and slavery and brutality and psychic and physical terrorism. It was sinister and gloomy and chaotic, with the special chaos of a dream. No Mexican really knew any other  Mexican,  and  when  a  Mexican  killed  someone  (which  happened  often),  it  was  usually  his best friend. Anyone who felt like it carried a gun, and I read of several occasions where drunken cops,  shooting  at  the  habitués  of  a  bar,  were  themselves  shot  by  armed  civilians.  As  authority figures, Mexican cops ranked with streetcar conductors.</p>

<p>All  officials  were  corruptible,  income  tax  was  very  low,  and  medical  treatment  was  extremely reasonable,  because  the doctors advertised  and cut  their prices.  You could get  a clap cured  for $2.40,  or  buy  the  penicillin  and  shoot  it  yourself.  There  were  no  regulations  curtailing  self-medication,  and  needles  and  syringes  could  be  bought  anywhere.  This  was  in  the  time  of Alemán, when the mordida was king, and a pyramid of bribes reached from the cop on the beat up to the Presidente. Mexico City was also the murder capital of the world, with the highest per-capita homicide rate. I remember newspaper stories every day, like these: A  campesino  is  in  from  the  country,  waiting  for  a  bus:  linen  pants,  sandals  made  from  a  tire,  a wide sombrero, a machete  at his belt.  Another  man is also waiting, dressed in  a suit, looking  at his wrist watch, muttering angrily. The campesino whips out his machete and cuts the man's head clean  off.  He  later  told  police:  "He  was  giving  me  looks  muy  feo  and  finally  I  could  not  contain myself." Obviously the man was annoyed because  the bus  was late,  and  was looking down  the road for the bus, when the campesino misinterpreted his action, and the next thing a head rolls in the gutter, grimacing horribly and showing gold teeth.</p>

<p>Two campesinos are sitting disconsolate by the roadside. They have no money for breakfast. But look:  a  boy leading  several  goats.  One  campesino picks  up a  rock  and bashes  the boy's  brains out. They take the goats to the nearest village and sell them. They are eating breakfast when they are apprehended by the police.</p>

<p>A man lives in a  little house. A stranger  asks  him  how to find  the  road  for  Ayahuasca.  "Ah,  this way,  señor."  He  is  leading  the  man  around  and  around:  "The  road  is  right  here."  Suddenly  he realizes he hasn't any idea where the road is, and why should he be bothered? So he picks up a rock and kills his tormentor.</p>

<p>Campesinos took  their toll with rock and machete. More murderous were the politicians and off-duty cops, each with his .45 automatic. One learned to hit the deck. Here is another actual story: A  gun-toting  político  hears  his  girl  is  cheating,  meeting  someone  in  this  cocktail  lounge.  Some American kid just happens in and sits next to her, when the macho bursts in: "¡CHINGOA!" Hauls out  his  .45  and  blasts  the  kid  right  off  his  bar  stool.  They  drag  the  body  outside  and  down  the street  a  ways.  When  the  cops  arrive,  the  bartender  shrugs  and  mops  his  bloody  bar,  and  says only: "Malos, esos muchachos!" ("Those bad boys!") Every country has its own special Shits, like the Southern law-man counting his Nigger notches, and  the  sneering  Mexican  macho  is  certainly  up  there  when  it  comes  to  sheer  ugliness.  And many of the Mexican middle class are about as awful as any bourgeoisie in the world. I remember that in Mexico the narcotic scripts were bright yellow, like a thousand-dollar bill, or a dishonorable discharge  from  the  Army.  One  time  Old  Dave  and  I  tried  to  fill  such  a  script,  which  he  had obtained quite legitimately from the Mexican government. The first pharmacist we hit jerked back snarling  from  such  a  sight:  "¡No  prestamos  servicio  a  los  viciosos!"  ("We  do  not  serve  dope fiends!")</p>

<p>From  one  farmacía  to  another  we  walked,  getting  sicker  with  every  step:  "No,  señor.  .  .  ."  We must have walked for miles.</p>

<p>"Never been in this neighborhood before."</p>

<p>"Well, let's try one more."</p>

<p>Finally we entered a tiny hole-in-the-wall farmacía. I pulled out the receta, and a gray-haired lady smiled at me. The pharmacist looked at the script, and said, "Two minutes, señor."</p>

<p>We sat  down to  wait. There  were  geraniums  in the  window.  A small boy  brought  me  a  glass  of water, and a cat rubbed against my leg. After awhile the pharmacist returned with our morphine.</p>

<p>"Gracias, señor"</p>

<p>Outside, the neighborhood now seemed enchanted: Little farmacías in a market, crates and stalls outside, a pulquería on the corner. Kiosks selling fried grasshoppers and peppermint candy black with  flies.  Boys  in  from  the  country  in  spotless  white  linen  and  rope  sandals,  with  faces  of burnished  copper  and  fierce  innocent  black  eyes,  like  exotic  animals,  of  a  dazzling  sexless beauty. Here  is  a  boy  with sharp features and  black skin, smelling of  vanilla, a  gardenia  behind his ear.  Yes,  you found  a  Johnson,  but  you  waded through  Shitville  to find  him.  You always  do.</p>

<p>Just when you think the earth is exclusively populated by Shits, you meet a Johnson.</p>

<p>One day there was a knock on my door at eight in the morning. I went to the door in my pyjamas, and there was an inspector from Immigration.</p>

<p>"Get your clothes on. You're under arrest." It seemed the woman next door had turned in a long report on my drunk and disorderly behavior, and also there was something wrong with my papers and where was the Mexican wife I was supposed to have? The Immigration officers were all set to  throw  me  in  jail  to  await  deportation  as  an  undesirable  alien.  Of  course,  everything  could  be straightened out with some money, but my interviewer was the head of the deporting department and  he  wouldn't  go  for  peanuts.  I  finally  had  to  get  up  off  of  two  hundred  dollars.  As  I  walked home from the Immigration Office, I imagined what I might have had to pay if I had really had an investment in Mexico City.</p>

<p>I thought of the constant problems the three American owners of the Ship Ahoy encountered. The cops came in all the time for a mordida, and then came the sanitary inspectors, then more cops trying to get something on the joint so they could take a real bite. They took the waiter downtown and beat the shit out of him. They wanted to know where was Kelly's body stashed? How many women  been  raped  in  the  joint? Who  brought  in  the  weed?  And  so  on.  Kelly  was  an  American hipster  who had been shot  in the Ship  Ahoy six months before, had recovered,  and was now in the U.S. Army. No woman was ever raped there, and no one ever smoked weed there. By now I had entirely abandoned my plans to open a bar in Mexico.</p>

<p>An  addict  has  little  regard  for  his  image.  He  wears  the  dirtiest,  shabbiest  clothes,  and  feels  no need  to  call  attention  to  himself.  During my  period  of  addiction  in  Tangiers,  I  was  known  as  "El Hombre  Invisible,"  The  Invisible  Man.  This  disintegration  of  self-image  often  results  in  an indiscriminate  image  hunger.  Billie  Holliday  said  she  knew  she  was  off  junk  when  she  stopped watching TV. In my first novel, Junky, the protagonist "Lee" comes across as integrated and self-contained,  sure  of  himself  and  where  he  is  going.  In  Queer  he  is  disintegrated,  desperately  in need of contact, completely unsure of himself and of his purpose.</p>

<p>The  difference  of  course  is  simple: Lee  on  junk  is  covered,  protected  and  also  severely  limited.</p>

<p>Not only does  junk short-circuit the sex  drive,  it also blunts emotional  reactions  to the vanishing point, depending on the dosage. Looking back over the action of Queer, that hallucinated month of  acute  withdrawal  takes  on  a  hellish  glow  of  menace  and  evil  drifting  out  of  neon-lit  cocktail bars,  the  ugly  violence,  the  .45  always  just  under  the  surface.  On  junk  I  was  insulated,  didn't drink, didn't go out much, just shot up and waited for the next shot.</p>

<p>When  the  cover  is  removed,  everything  that  has  been  held  in  check  by  junk  spills  out.  The withdrawing addict is subject to the emotional excesses of a child or an adolescent, regardless of his  actual  age.  And  the  sex  drive  returns  in  full  force.  Men  of  sixty  experience  wet  dreams  and spontaneous orgasms (an extremely unpleasant  experience,  agaçant as the French say, putting the teeth on edge). Unless the reader keeps this in mind, the metamorphosis of Lee's character will appear  as inexplicable  or psychotic.  Also bear  in  mind that the  withdrawal syndrome is self-limiting,  lasting  no  more  than  a  month.  And  Lee  has  a  phase  of  excessive  drinking,  which exacerbates  all  the  worst  and  most  dangerous  aspects  of  the  withdrawal  sickness:  reckless, unseemly, outrageous, maudlin—in a word, appalling—behavior.</p>

<p>After  withdrawal,  the  organism  readjusts  and  stabilizes  at  a  pre-junk  level.  In  the  narrative,  this stabilization is finally reached during the South American trip. No junk is available, nor any other drug,  after  the  paregoric  of  Panama.  Lee's  drinking  has  dwindled  to  several  good  stiff  ones  at sundown.  Not  so  different  from  the  Lee  of  the  later  Yage  Letters,  except  for  the  phantom presence of Allerton.</p>

<p>So I had written Junky, and the motivation for that was comparatively simple: to put down in the most  accurate  and  simple  terms  my  experiences  as  an  addict.  I  was  hoping  for  publication, money,  recognition.  Kerouac  had  published  The  Town  and  the  City  at  the  time  I  started  writing Junky. I remember writing in a letter to him, when his book was published, that money and fame were now assured. As you can see, I knew nothing about the writing business at the time.</p>

<p>My motivations to write Queer  were more complex, and are not clear to me at the present time.</p>

<p>Why should I wish to chronicle so carefully these extremely painful and unpleasant and lacerating memories? While  it  was  I  who  wrote  Junky, I  feel  that  I  was  being  written  in  Queer.  I  was  also taking  pains  to  ensure  further  writing, so  as  to set  the  record  straight:  writing  as  inoculation.  As soon  as  something  is  written,  it  loses  the  power  of  surprise,  just  as  a  virus  loses  its  advantage when a weakened virus has created alerted antibodies. So I achieved some immunity from further perilous ventures along these lines by writing my experience down.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the Queer manuscript fragment, having returned from the insulation of junk to the  land  of  the  living  like  a  frantic  inept  Lazarus,  Lee  seems  determined  to  score,  in  the  sexual sense  of  the  word.  There  is  something  curiously systematic  and unsexual about  his  quest  for  a suitable  sex  object,  crossing  one  prospect  after  another  off  a  list  which  seems  compiled  with ultimate failure in mind. On some very deep level he does not want to succeed, but will go to any length to avoid the realization that he is not really looking for sex contact.</p>

<p>But Allerton was definitely some sort of contact. And what was the contact that Lee was looking for? Seen from here, a very confused concept that had nothing to do with Allerton as a character.</p>

<p>While  the  addict  is  indifferent  to  the  impression  he  creates  in  others,  during  withdrawal  he  may feel  the  compulsive  need  for  an  audience,  and  this  is  clearly  what  Lee  seeks  in  Allerton:  an audience,  the  acknowledgement  of  his  performance,  which  of  course  is  a  mask,  to  cover  a shocking  disintegration.  So  he  invents  a  frantic  attention-getting  format  which  he  calls  the Routine: shocking, funny, riveting. "It is an Ancient Mariner, and he stoppeth one of three. . . ."</p>

<p>The  performance  takes  the  form  of  routines:  fantasies  about  Chess  Players,  the  Texas  Oilman, Corn Hole Gus's Used-Slave Lot. In Queer, Lee addresses these routines to an actual audience.</p>

<p>Later, as he develops as a writer, the audience becomes internalized. But the same mechanism that produced A.J. and Doctor Benway, the same creative impulse, is dedicated to Allerton, who is forced into the role of approving Muse, in which he feels understandably uncomfortable.</p>

<p>What  Lee  is  looking  for  is  contact  or  recognition,  like  a  photon  emerging  from  the  haze  of insubstantiality  to  leave  an  indelible  recording  in  Allerton's  consciousness.  Failing  to  find  an adequate  observer,  he  is  threatened  by painful  dispersal,  like  an  unobserved  photon.  Lee  does not know that he is already committed to writing, since this is the only way he has of making an indelible  record,  whether  Allerton  is  inclined  to  observe  or  not.  Lee  is  being  inexorably  pressed into the world of fiction. He has already made the choice between his life and his work.</p>

<p>The manuscript trails off in Puyo, End of the Road town. . . . The search for Yage has failed. The mysterious Doctor Cotter wants only to be rid of his unwelcome guests. He suspects them to be agents of his treacherous  partner Gill, intent on stealing his genius work of isolating curare from the composite arrow poison. I heard later that the chemical companies decided simply to buy up the arrow poison in quantity and extract the curare in their American laboratories. The drug was soon synthesized, and is now a standard substance found in many muscle-relaxing preparations.</p>

<p>So it would seem that Cotter really had nothing to lose: his efforts were already superseded.</p>

<p>Dead end.  And  Puyo  can  serve  as  a  model for  the Place  of  Dead Roads:  a  dead,  meaningless conglomerate  of  tin-roofed  houses  under  a  continual  downpour  of  rain.  Shell  has  pulled  out, leaving prefabricated bungalows and rusting machinery behind. And Lee has reached the end of his line, an end implicit in the beginning. He is left with the impact of unbridgeable distances, the defeat and weariness of a long, painful journey made for nothing, wrong turnings, the track lost, a bus waiting in the rain . . . back to Ambato, Quito, Panama, Mexico City.</p>

<p>When I started to write this companion text to Queer, I was paralyzed with a heavy reluctance, a writer's block like a straitjacket: "I glance at the manuscript of Queer and feel I simply can't read it.</p>

<p>My past  was  a  poisoned  river  from  which one  was fortunate  to  escape,  and  by  which  one  feels immediately threatened, years after the events recorded. —Painful to an extent I find it difficult to read, let alone to write about. Every word and gesture sets the teeth on edge." The reason for this reluctance  becomes  clearer  as  I  force  myself  to  look:  the  book  is  motivated  and  formed  by  an event which is never mentioned, in fact is carefully avoided: the accidental shooting death of my wife, Joan, in September 1951.</p>

<p>While I was writing The Place of Dead Roads, I felt in spiritual contact with the late English writer Denton Welch, and modelled the novel's hero, Kim Carson, directly on him. Whole sections came to  me  as  if  dictated,  like  table-tapping.  I  have  written  about  the  fateful  morning  of  Denton's accident, which left him an invalid for the remainder of his short life. If he had stayed a little longer here, not so long there, he would have missed his appointment with the female motorist who hit his bicycle from behind for no apparent reason. At one point Denton had stopped to have coffee, and looking at the brass hinges on the café's window shutters, some of them broken, he was hit by  a  feeling  of  universal  desolation  and  loss.  So  every  event  of  that  morning  is  charged  with special  significance,  as  if  it  were  underlined.  This  portentous  second  sight  permeates  Welch's writing:  a  scone,  a  cup  of  tea,  an  inkwell  purchased  for  a  few  shillings,  become  charged  with  a special and often sinister significance.</p>

<p>I get exactly the same feeling to an almost unbearable degree as I read the manuscript of Queer.</p>

<p>The  event towards  which Lee feels himself inexorably driven is the death  of his wife by his  own hand, the knowledge of possession, a dead hand waiting to slip over his like a glove. So a smog of menace and evil rises from the pages, an evil that Lee, knowing and yet not knowing, tries to escape with frantic flights of fantasy: his routines, which set one's teeth on edge because of the ugly menace just behind or to one side of them, a presence palpable as a haze.</p>

<p>Brion  Gysin  said  to  me  in  Paris:  "For  ugly  spirit  shot  Joan  because  .  .  ."  A  bit  of  mediumistic message that was not completed—or was it? It doesn't need to be completed, if you read it: "ugly spirit  shot  Joan  to  be  cause,"  that  is,  to  maintain  a  hateful  parasitic  occupation.  My  concept  of possession is closer to the medieval model than to modern psychological explanations, with their dogmatic  insistence  that  such  manifestations  must  come  from  within  and  never,  never,  never from  without.  (As  if  there  were  some  clear-cut  difference  between  inner  and  outer.)  I  mean  a definite possessing entity. And indeed, the psychological concept  might well have  been devised by the possessing entities, since nothing is more dangerous to a possessor than being seen as a separate  invading creature by the host  it has invaded.  And for  this reason the possessor shows itself only when absolutely necessary.</p>

<p>In  1939,  I  became  interested  in  Egyptian  hieroglyphics  and  went  out  to  see  someone  in  the Department of Egyptology at the University of Chicago. And something was screaming in my ear:</p>

<p>"YOU  DONT  BELONG  HERE!"  Yes,  the  hieroglyphics  provided  one  key  to  the  mechanism  of possession. Like a virus, the possessing entity must find a port of entry.</p>

<p>This  occasion  was  my  first  clear  indication  of  something  in  my  being  that  was  not  me,  and  not under my control. I remember a dream from this period: I worked as an exterminator in Chicago, in the late 1930's, and lived in a rooming house on the near North Side. In the dream I am floating up  near  the  ceiling  with  a  feeling  of  utter  death  and  despair,  and  looking  down  I  see  my  body walking out the door with deadly purpose.</p>

<p>One  wonders  if  Yage could  have  saved  the  day  by  a  blinding  revelation.  I  remember  a  cut-up  I made  in  Paris  years  later:  "Raw  peeled  winds  of  hate  and  mischance  blew  the  shot."  And  for years  I  thought  this  referred  to blowing  a  shot  of  junk,  when  the junk  squirts  out  the side  of  the syringe or dropper owing to an obstruction. Brion Gysin pointed out the actual meaning: the shot that killed Joan.</p>

<p>I had bought  a Scout knife in Quito. It had a metal handle and a curious  tarnished old look, like something from a turn-of-the-century junk shop. I can see it in a tray of old knives and rings, with the  silver  plate  flaking  off.  It  was  about  three  o'clock  in  the  afternoon,  a  few  days  after  I  came back to Mexico City, and I decided to have the knife sharpened. The knife-sharpener had a little whistle and a fixed route, and as I walked down the street towards his cart a feeling of loss and sadness  that had  weighed  on me all day so  I could  hardly breathe  intensified to such an extent that I found tears streaming down my face.</p>

<p>"What on earth is wrong?" I wondered.</p>

<p>This  heavy  depression  and  a  feeling  of  doom  occurs  again  and  again  in  the  text.  Lee  usually attributes it to his failures with Allerton: "A heavy drag slowed movement and thought. Lee's face was rigid, his voice toneless." Allerton has just refused a dinner invitation and left abruptly: "Lee stared  at  the  table,  his  thoughts  slow,  as  if  he  were  very  cold."  (Reading  this  /  am  cold  and depressed.)</p>

<p>Here  is  a  precognitive  dream  from  Cotter's  shack  in  Ecuador:  "He  was  standing  in  front  of  the Ship Ahoy. The place looked deserted. He could hear someone crying. He saw his little son, and knelt down and took the child in his arms. The sound of crying came closer, a wave of sadness.</p>

<p>... He  held  little Willy  close  against  his  chest.  A group  of  people  were  standing  there  in  Convict suits. Lee wondered what they were doing there and why he was crying."</p><empty-line /><p>I  have  constrained  myself  to  remember  the  day  of  Joan's  death,  the  overwhelming  feeling  of doom  and  loss  .  .  .  walking  down  the  street  I  suddenly  found  tears  streaming  down  my  face.</p>

<p>"What  is  wrong  with  me?"  The  small  Scout  knife  with  a  metal  handle,  the  plating  peeling  off,  a smell  of  old  coins,  the  knife-sharpener's  whistle.  Whatever  happened  to  this  knife  I  never reclaimed?</p>

<p>I  am  forced  to  the  appalling  conclusion  that  I  would  never  have  become  a  writer  but  for  Joan's death,  and  to  a  realization  of  the  extent  to  which  this  event  has  motivated  and  formulated  my writing.  I  live  with  the  constant  threat  of  possession,  and  a  constant  need  to  escape  from possession, from Control. So the death of Joan brought me in contact with the invader, the Ugly Spirit, and maneuvered me into a lifelong struggle, in which I have had no choice except to write my way out.</p>

<p>I have constrained myself to escape death. Denton Welch is almost my face. Smell of old coins.</p>

<p>Whatever  happened  to  this  knife  called  Allerton,  back  to  the  appalling  Margaras  Inc.  The realization is basic formulated <strong>doing? </strong> The day of Joan's doom and loss. Found tears streaming down from Allerton peeling off the same person as a Western shootist. <strong>What are you rewriting? </strong></p>

<p>A lifelong  preoccupation with Control  and Virus. Having gained  access  the virus uses the host's energy, blood, flesh and bones to make copies of itself. Model of dogmatic insistence never never from without was screaming in my ear, "YOU DON'T BELONG HERE!"</p>

<p>A straitjacket notation carefully paralyzed with heavy reluctance. To escape their prewritten lines years  after  the  events  recorded.  A  writers  block  avoided  Joans  death.  Denton  Welch  is  Kim Carson's voice through a cloud underlined broken table tapping.</p>

<p>William S. Burroughs February 1985</p>

<p><strong>Chapter 1</strong></p>

<p>Lee turned his attention to a Jewish boy named Carl Steinberg, whom he had known casually for about a year. The first time he saw Carl, Lee thought, "I could use that, if the family jewels weren't in pawn to Uncle Junk."</p>

<p>The  boy  was  blond,  his  face  thin  and  sharp  with  a  few  freckles,  always  a  little  pink  around  the ears and nose as though he had just washed. Lee had never known anyone to look as clean as Carl. With  his  small  round  brown  eyes  and  fuzzy  blond  hair,  he  reminded  Lee  of  a  young  bird.</p>

<p>Born in Munich, Carl had grown up in Baltimore. In manner and outlook he seemed European. He shook hands with traces of a heel-click. In general, Lee found European youths easier to talk to than Americans. The rudeness of many Americans depressed him, a rudeness based on a solid ignorance  of  the  whole  concept  of  manners,  and  on  the proposition  that  for  social  purposes,  all people are more or less equal and interchangeable.</p>

<p>What Lee looked  for  in any relationship  was the feel  of  contact.  He  felt  some  contact  with Carl.</p>

<p>The  boy  listened  politely  and  seemed  to  understand  what  Lee  was  saying.  After  some  initial balking,  he  accepted  the  fact  of  Lee's  sexual  interest  in  his  person.  He  told  Lee,  "Since  I  can't change my mind about you, I will have to change my mind about other things."</p>

<p>But  Lee  soon  found  out  he  could  make  no  progress.  "If  I  got  this  far  with  an  American  kid,"  he reasoned, "I could get the rest of the way. So he's not queer. People can be obliging. What is the obstacle?" Lee finally guessed the answer: "What makes it impossible is that his mother wouldn't like it." And Lee knew it was time to pack in. He recalled a homosexual Jewish friend who lived in Oklahoma  City.  Lee  had  asked,  "Why  do  you  live  here?  You  have  enough  money  to  live anywhere  you  like."  The  reply  was,  "It  would  kill  my  mother  if  I  moved  away."  Lee  had  been speechless.</p>

<p>One afternoon Lee was walking with Carl by the Amsterdam Avenue park. Suddenly Carl bowed slightly and shook Lee's hand. "Best of luck," he said, and ran for a streetcar.</p>

<p>Lee  stood  looking  after  him,  then  walked  over  into  the  park  and  sat  down  on  a  concrete  bench that was molded to resemble wood. Blue flowers from a blossoming tree had fallen on the bench and on the walk in front of it. Lee sat there watching the flowers move along the path in a warm spring wind. The sky was clouding up for an afternoon shower. Lee felt lonely and defeated.  "I'll have  to  look  for  someone  else,"  he  thought.  He  covered  his  face  with  his  hands.  He  was  very tired.</p>

<p>He saw a shadowy line of boys. As each boy came to the front of the line, he said "Best of luck,"</p>

<p>and ran for a streetcar.</p>

<p>"Sorry . . . wrong number ... try again . . . somewhere else . . . someplace else . . . not here. . . not me ... can't use it, don't need it, don't want it. Why pick on me?" The last face was so real and so ugly, Lee said aloud, "Who asked you, you ugly son of a bitch?"</p>

<p>Lee opened his eyes and looked around. Two Mexican adolescents walked by, their arms around each other's necks. He looked after them, licking his dry, cracked lips.</p>

<p>Lee  continued  to  see  Carl  after  that,  until  finally  Carl  said  "Best  of  luck"  for  the  last  time,  and walked away. Lee heard later he had gone with his family to Uruguay.</p>

<p>Lee was sitting with Winston Moor in the Rathskeller, drinking double tequilas. Cuckoo clocks and moth-eaten deer heads gave the restaurant a dreary, out-of-place, Tyrolean look. A smell of spilt beer,  overflowing toilets  and  sour  garbage hung  in  the  place like  a  thick fog  and drifted  out into the street  through  narrow,  inconvenient  swinging  doors.  A television  set  which  was  out  of  order half the time and which emitted horrible, guttural squawks was the final touch of unpleasantness.</p>

<p>"I was in here last night," Lee said to Moor. "Got talking to a queer doctor and his boyfriend. The doctor was a major in the Medical Corps. The  boyfriend is some kind of vague engineer.  Awful-looking little bitch. So the doctor invites me to have a drink with them, and the boyfriend is getting jealous, and I don't want a beer anyway, which the doctor takes as a reflection on Mexico and on his own person. He begins the do-you-like-Mexico routine. So I tell him Mexico is okay, some of it, but he personally is a pain in the ass. Told him this in a nice way, you understand. Besides, I had to go home to my wife in any case.</p>

<p>"So he says, 'You don't have any wife, you are just as queer as I am.' I told him, 'I don't know how queer  you  are,  Doc,  and  I  ain't  about  to  find  out.  It  isn't  as  if  you  was  a  good-looking  Mexican.</p>

<p>You're  a  goddamned  old  ugly-looking  Mexican.  And  that  goes  double  for  your  moth-eaten boyfriend.' I was hoping, of course, the deal wouldn't come to any extreme climax. . . .</p>

<p>"You never knew Hatfield? Of course not. Before  your time. He killed a cargador in a pulquería.</p>

<p>The deal cost him five hundred dollars. Now, figuring a cargador as rock bottom, think how much it would cost you to shoot a major in the Mexican Army."</p>

<p>Moor  called  the  waiter  over.  "Yo  quiero  un  sandwich,"  he  said,  smiling  at  the  waiter.  "¿Quel sandwiches tiene?"</p>

<p>"What do you want?" Lee asked, annoyed at the interruption.</p>

<p>"I  don't  know  exactly,"  said  Moor,  looking  through  the  menu.  "I  wonder  if  they  could  make  a melted cheese sandwich on toasted whole-wheat bread?" Moor turned back to the waiter, with a smile that was intended to be boyish.</p>

<p>Lee  closed  his  eyes  as  Moor  launched  an  attempt  to  convey  the  concept  of  melted  cheese  on wholewheat  toast.  Moor  was  being  charmingly  helpless  with  his  inadequate  Spanish.  He  was putting  down  a  little-boy-in-a-foreign-country  routine.  Moor  smiled  into  an  inner  mirror,  a  smile without  a  trace  of  warmth,  but  it  was  not  a  cold  smile:  it  was  the  meaningless  smile  of  senile decay,  the  smile that  goes  with false  teeth,  the  smile of  a  man grown  old  and  stir-simple  in  the solitary confinement of exclusive self-love.</p>

<p>Moor was a thin young man with blond hair that was habitually somewhat long. He had pale blue eyes and very white skin. There were dark patches under his eyes and two deep lines around the mouth.  He  looked  like  a  child,  and  at  the  same  time  like  a  prematurely  aged  man.  His  face showed  the  ravages  of  the  death  process,  the  inroads  of  decay  in  flesh  cut  off  from  the  living charge of contact. Moor was motivated, literally kept alive and moving, by hate, but there was no passion  or  violence  in  his  hate.  Moor's  hate  was  a  slow,  steady  push,  weak  but  infinitely persistent,  waiting to  take  advantage  of  any  weakness  in another.  The  slow  drip  of  Moor's  hate had etched the lines of decay in his face. He had aged without experience of life, like a piece of meat rotting on a pantry shelf.</p>

<p>Moor  made a  practice  of  interrupting  a  story just  before  the  point  was reached.  Often  he  would start a long conversation with a waiter or anybody else handy, or he would go vague and distant, yawn, and say, "What was that?" as though recalled to dull reality from reflections of which others could have no concept.</p>

<p>Moor  began  talking  about  his  wife.  "At  first,  Bill,  she  was  so  dependent  on  me  that  she  used literally to have  hysterics  when I  had to go to the museum  where I  work. I managed to build  up her ego to the point where she didn't need me, and after that the only thing I could do was leave.</p>

<p>There was nothing more I could do for her."</p>

<p>Moor was putting down his sincere act. "My God," Lee thought, "he really believes it."</p>

<p>Lee ordered another double tequila. Moor stood up. "Well, I have to get going," he said. "I have a lot of things to do."</p>

<p>"Well, listen," said Lee. "How about dinner tonight?"</p>

<p>Moor said, "Well, all right."</p>

<p>"At six in the K.C. Steak House."</p>

<p>"All right. "Moor left.</p>

<p>Lee drank half the tequila the waiter put in front of him. He had known Moor off and on in N.Y. for several years and never liked him. Moor disliked Lee, but then Moor didn't like anybody. Lee told himself, "You must be crazy, making passes in that direction, when you know what a bitch he is.</p>

<p>These borderline characters can out-bitch any fag."</p>

<p>When  Lee  arrived  at  the  K.C.  Steak  House,  Moor  was  already  there.  With  him  he  had  Tom Williams, another Salt Lake City boy. Lee thought, "He brought along a chaperone."</p>

<p>"... I like the guy, Tom, but I can't stand to be alone with him. He keeps  trying to go to bed with me. That's what I don't like about queers. You can't keep it on a basis of friendship. ..." Yes, Lee could hear that conversation.</p>

<p>During dinner Moor and Williams talked about a boat they planned to build at Ziuhuatenejo. Lee thought this was a silly project. "Boat building is a job for a professional, isn't it?" Lee asked. Moor pretended not to hear.</p>

<p>After dinner Lee walked back to Moor's rooming house with Moor and Williams. At the door Lee asked,  "Would  you  gentlemen  care  for  a  drink?  I'll  get  a  bottle.  .  .  ."He  looked  from  one  to  the other.</p>

<p>Moor said, "Well, no. You see we want to work on the plans for this boat we are going to build."</p>

<p>"Oh," said Lee. "Well, I'll see you tomorrow. How about meeting me for a drink in the Rathskeller?</p>

<p>Say around five."</p>

<p>"Well, I expect I'll be busy tomorrow."</p>

<p>"Yes, but you have to eat and drink."</p>

<p>"Well,  you see,  this  boat  is  more  important  to me  than  anything  right  now.  It  will  take  up  all  my time."</p>

<p>Lee said, "Suit yourself," and walked away.</p>

<p>Lee was deeply hurt. He could hear Moor saying, "Thanks for running interference, Tom. Well, I hope he got the idea. Of course Lee is an interesting guy and all that . . . but this queer situation is just more than I can take." Tolerant, looking at both sides of the question, sympathetic up to a point, finally forced to draw a tactful but firm line. "And he really believes that," Lee thought. "Like that crap about building up his wife's ego. He can revel  in the satisfactions of virulent bitchiness and simultaneously see himself as a saint. Quite a trick."</p>

<p>Actually  Moor's  brush-off  was  calculated  to  inflict  the  maximum  hurt  possible  under  the circumstances.  It  put  Lee  in  the  position  of  a  detestably  insistent  queer,  too  stupid  and  too insensitive to realize that his attentions were not wanted, forcing Moor to tbe distasteful necessity of drawing a diagram.</p>

<p>Lee  leaned  against  a  lamppost  for  several  minutes.  The  shock  had  sobered  him,  drained  away his drunken euphoria. He realized how tired he was, and how weak, but he was not ready yet to go home.</p>

<p><strong>Chapter 2</strong></p>

<p>Everything  made  in  this  country  falls  apart,"  Lee  thought.  He  was  examining  the  blade  of  his stainless-steel  pocketknife.  The  chrome  plating  was  peeling  off  like  silver  paper.  "Wouldn't surprise me if I picked up a boy in the Alameda and his. . . . Here comes honest Joe."</p>

<p>Joe Guidry sat down at the table with Lee, dropping bundles on the table and in the empty chair.</p>

<p>He  wiped off  the top  of  a  beer  bottle  with his  sleeve  and drank  half  the beer  in  a  long  gulp.  He was a large man with a politician's red Irish face.</p>

<p>"What you know?" Lee asked.</p>

<p>"Not  much,  Lee.  Except  someone  stole  my  typewriter.  And  I  know  who  took  it.  It  was  that Brazilian, or whatever he is. You know him. Maurice."</p>

<p>"Maurice? Is that the one you had last week? The wrestler?"</p>

<p>"You  mean Louie,  the gym  instructor.  No,  this  is  another  one. Louie  has  decided  all that  sort  of thing is very wrong and he tells me that I am going to burn in hell, but he is going to heaven."</p>

<p>"Serious?"</p>

<p>"Oh,  yes. Well,  Maurice  is  as  queer  as  I  am."  Joe  belched.  "Excuse  me.  If  not  queerer.  But  he won't  accept  it.  I  think  stealing  my  typewriter  is  a  way  he  takes  to  demonstrate  to  me  and  to himself that he is just in it for all he can get. As a matter of fact, he's so queer I've lost interest in him.  Not  completely  though.  When  I  see  the  little  bastard  I'll  most  likely  invite  him  back  to  my apartment, instead of beating the shit out of him like I should."</p>

<p>Lee tipped  his  chair back  against the wall and looked around the room. Someone was writing a letter at the next table. If he had overheard the conversation, he gave no sign. The proprietor was reading  the  bullfight  section  of  the  paper,  spread  out  on  the  counter  in  front  of  him.  A  silence peculiar to Mexico seeped into the room, a vibrating, soundless hum.</p>

<p>Joe  finished  his  beer,  wiped  his  mouth  with  the  hack  of  his  hand,  and  stared  at  the  wall  with watery,  bloodshot  blue  eyes.  The  silence  seeped  into  Lee's  body,  and  his  face  went  slack  and blank. The effect was curiously spectral, as though you could see through his face. The face was ravaged  and  vicious  and  old,  but  the  clear,  green  eyes  were  dreamy  and  innocent.  His  light-brown  hair  was  extremely  fine  and  would  not  stay  combed.  Generally  it  fell  down  across  his forehead, and on occasion brushed the food he was eating or got in his drink.</p>

<p>"Well, I have to be going,"  said Joe. He gathered up his bundles and nodded to Lee, bestowing on him one of his sweet politician smiles, and walked out, his fuzzy, half-bald head outlined for a moment in the sunlight before he disappeared from view.</p>

<p>Lee  yawned  and  picked  up  a  comic  section  from  the  next  table.  It  was  two  days  old.  He  put  it down and yawned again. He got up and paid for his drink and walked out into the late afternoon sun.  He  had  no  place  to  go,  so  he  went  over  to  Sears'  magazine  counter  and  read  the  new magazines for free.</p><empty-line /><p>He  cut  back  past  the  K.C.  Steak  House.  Moor  beckoned to  him  from  inside the  restaurant.  Lee went  in  and  sat  down  at  his  table.  "You  look  terrible,"  he  said.  He  knew  that  was  what  Moor wanted to hear.  As a matter of fact,  Moor did look worse than usual.  He had always been pale; now he was yellowish.</p>

<p>The boat project had fallen through. Moor and</p>

<p>Williams  and Williams' wife,  Lil,  were  back  from  Ziuhuatenejo.  Moor  was not  on  speaking  terms with the Williamses.</p>

<p>Lee  ordered  a  pot  of  tea.  Moor  started  talking  about  Lil.  "You  know,  Lil  ate  the  cheese  down there.  She  ate  everything  and  she  never  got  sick.  She  won't  go  to  a  doctor.  One  morning  she woke up blind in one eye and she could barely see out the other. But she wouldn't have a doctor.</p>

<p>In a few days she could see again, good as ever. I was hoping she'd go blind."</p>

<p>Lee realized Moor was perfectly serious. "He's insane," Lee thought.</p>

<p>Moor  went on about  Lil.  She had made advances  to him,  of course.  He had paid  more than his share of the rent and food. She was a terrible cook. They had left him there sick. He shifted to the subject of his health. "Just let me show you my urine test," Moor said with boyish enthusiasm. He spread the piece of paper out on the table. Lee looked at it without interest.</p>

<p>"Look here." Moor pointed. "Urea thirteen. Normal is fifteen to twenty-two. Is that serious, do you think?"</p>

<p>"I'm sure I don't know."</p>

<p>"And  traces  of  sugar.  What  does  the  whole  picture  mean?"  Moor  obviously  considered  the question of intense interest.</p>

<p>"Why don't you take it to a doctor?" "I did. He said he would have to take a twenty-four-hour test, that is, samples of urine over a twenty-four-hour period, before he could express any opinion. . . .</p>

<p>You know, I have a dull pain in the chest, right here. I wonder if it could be tuberculosis?"</p>

<p>"Take an x-ray."</p>

<p>"I did. The  doctor is going  to take a skin reaction test. Oh, another thing, I think I have undulant fever. ... Do you think I have fever now?" He pushed his forehead forward for Lee to feel. Lee felt an ear lobe. "I don't think so," he said.</p>

<p>Moor went on and on, following the circular route of the true hypochondriac, back to tuberculosis and the urine test.  Lee thought  he had never  heard anything  as tiresome and depressing. Moor did  not  have  tuberculosis  or  kidney  trouble  or  undulant  fever.  He  was  sick  with  the  sickness  of death.  Death  was  in  every  cell  of  his  body.  He  gave  off  a  faint,  greenish  steam  of  decay.  Lee imagined he would glow in the dark.</p>

<p>Moor talked with boyish eagerness. "I think I need an operation."</p>

<p>Lee said he really had to go.</p>

<p>Lee turned down Coahuila, walking with one foot falling directly in front of the other, always fast and  purposeful,  as  if  he  were  leaving  the  scene  of  a  holdup.  He  passed  a  group  in  expatriate uniform:  red-checked  shirt  outside  the  belt,  blue  jeans  and  beard,  and  another  group  of  young men  in  conventional,  if  shabby,  clothes.  Among  these  Lee  recognized  a  boy  named  Eugene Allerton.  Allerton  was  tall  and  very  thin,  with  high  cheekbones,  a  small,  bright-red  mouth,  and amber-colored eyes that took on a faint violet flush when he was drunk. His gold-brown hair was differentially bleached by the sun  like  a sloppy dyeing job.  He had straight, black  eyebrows  and black  eyelashes.  An  equivocal  face,  very  young,  clean-cut  and  boyish,  at  the  same  time conveying  an  impression  of  makeup,  delicate  and  exotic  and  Oriental.  Allerton  was  never completely neat or clean, but you did not think of him as being dirty. He was simply careless and lazy to the point of appearing, at times, only half awake. Often he did not hear what someone said a  foot  from  his  ear.  "Pellagra,  I  expect,"  thought  Lee  sourly. He  nodded  to  Allerton  and  smiled.</p>

<p>Allerton nodded, as if surprised, and did not smile.</p><empty-line /><p>Lee walked on, a little depressed. "Perhaps I can accomplish something in that direction. Well, a ver. . . ." He froze in front of a restaurant like a bird dog: "Hungry . . . quicker to eat here than buy something  and cook it." When Lee  was hungry, when he  wanted a  drink or a shot  of morphine, delay was unbearable.</p>

<p>He went in, ordered steak a la Mexicana and a glass of milk, and waited with his mouth watering for food. A young man with a round face and a loose mouth came into the restaurant.  Lee said,</p>

<p>"Hello, Horace," in a clear voice. Horace nodded without speaking and sat down as far from Lee as he could  get in the small restaurant. Lee smiled. His  food  arrived  and he ate  quickly, like an animal,  cramming  bread  and  steak  into  his  mouth  and  washing  it  down  with  gulps  of  milk.  He leaned back in his chair and lit a cigarette.</p>

<p>"Un  café  sólo,"  he  called  to  the  waitress  as  she  walked  by,  carrying  a  pineapple  soda  to  two young  Mexicans  in  double-breasted  pinstripe  suits.  One  of  the  Mexicans  had  moist  brown  pop-eyes  and  a  scraggly  moustache  of  greasy  black  hairs.  He  looked  pointedly  at  Lee,  and  Lee looked  away.  "Careful,"  he  thought,  "or  he  will  be  over  here  asking  me  how  I  like  Mexico."  He dropped  his  half-smoked  cigarette  into  half  an  inch  of  cold  coffee,  walked  over  to  the  counter, paid  the  bill,  and  was  out  of  the  restaurant  before  the  Mexican  could  formulate  an  opening sentence. When Lee decided to leave some place, his departure was abrupt.</p>

<p>The  Ship  Ahoy  had  a  few  phony  hurricane  lamps  by  way  of  a  nautical  atmosphere.  Two  small rooms with tables,  the bar  in one room, and four  high,  precarious  stools.  The  place  was always dimly lit and sinister-looking. The patrons were tolerant, but in no way bohemian. The bearded set never  frequented  the  Ship  Ahoy.  The  place  existed  on  borrowed  time,  without  a  liquor  license, under many changes of management. At this time it was run by an American named Tom Weston and an American-born Mexican.</p>

<p>Lee walked directly to the bar and ordered a drink. He drank it and ordered a second one before looking around the room to see if Allerton was there. Allerton was alone at a table, tipped back in a chair  with one  leg crossed  over  the other,  holding  a  bottle  of beer  on his knee. He  nodded  to Lee. Lee tried to achieve a greeting at once friendly and casual, designed to show interest without pushing their short acquaintance. The result was ghastly.</p>

<p>As  Lee  stood  aside  to  bow  in  his  dignified  old-world  greeting,  there  emerged  instead  a  leer  of naked  lust,  wrenched  in  the  pain  and  hate  of  his  deprived  body  and,  in  simultaneous  double exposure,  a  sweet  child's  smile  of  liking  and  trust,  shockingly  out  of  time  and  out  of  place, mutilated and hopeless.</p>

<p>Allerton  was  appalled.  "Perhaps  he  has  some  sort  of  tic,"  he  thought.  He  decided  to  remove himself  from  contact  with  Lee  before  the  man  did  something  even  more  distasteful.  The  effect was like a broken connection. Allerton was not cold or hostile; Lee simply wasn't there so far as he  was  concerned.  Lee  looked  at  him  helplessly  for  a  moment,  then  turned  back  to  the  bar, defeated and shaken.</p>

<p>Lee  finished  his  second  drink.  When  he  looked  around  again,  Allerton  was  playing  chess  with Mary, an American girl with dyed red hair and carefully applied makeup, who had come into the bar in the meantime. "Why waste time here?" Lee thought. He paid for the two drinks and walked out.</p>

<p>He  took  a  cab  to  the  Chimu  Bar,  which  was  a  fag  bar  frequented  by  Mexicans,  and  spent  the night with a young boy he met there.</p>

<p>At  that  time  the  G.I.  students  patronized  Lola's  during  the  daytime  and  the  Ship  Ahoy  at  night.</p>

<p>Lola's was not exactly a bar. It was a small beer-and-soda joint. There was a Coca-Cola box full of beer and soda and ice at the left of the door as you came in. A counter with tube-metal stools covered  in  yellow  glazed  leather  ran  down  one  side  of  the  room  as  far  as  the  juke  box.  Tables were lined along the wall opposite the counter. The stools had long since lost the rubber caps for the  legs,  and  made  horrible  screeching  noises  when  the  maid  pushed  them  around  to  sweep.</p>

<p>There  was  a  kitchen  in  back,  where  a  slovenly  cook  fried  everything  in  rancid  fat.  There  was neither past nor future in Lola's. The place was a waiting room, where certain people checked in at certain times.</p>

<p>Several days after his pick-up in the Chimu, Lee was sitting in Lola's, reading aloud from Últimas Notícias  to  Jim  Cochan.  There  was  a  story  about  a  man  who  murdered  his  wife  and  children, Cochan looked about for a means to escape, but every time he made a move to go, Lee pinned him down with: "Get a load of this. . . . 'When his wife came home from the market, her husband, already drunk, was brandishing his .45.' Why do they always have to brandish it?"</p>

<p>Lee read to himself for a moment. Cochan stirred uneasily. "Jesus Christ," said Lee, looking up.</p>

<p>"After  he  killed  his  wife  and  three  children  he  takes  a  razor  and  puts  on  a  suicide  act."  He returned  to  the  paper:  "'But  resulted  only  with  scratches  that  did  not  require  medical  attention.'</p>

<p>What  a  slobbish  performance!"  He  turned  the  page  and  began  reading  the  leads  half-aloud:</p>

<p>'They're  cutting  the  butter  with  Vaseline.  Fine  thing.  Lobster  with  drawn  K.Y.  .  .  .  Here's  a  man was surprised in his taco stand with a dressed-down dog ... a great long skinny hound dog at that.</p>

<p>There's  a  picture  of  him  posing  in  front  of  his  taco  stand  with  the  dog.  .  ,  .  One  citizen  asked another for a light. The party in second part don't have a match so first part pulls an ice pick and kills him. Murder is the national neurosis of Mexico."</p>

<p>Cochan stood up. Lee was on his feet instantly. "Sit down on your ass, or what's left of it after four years in the Navy," he said.</p>

<p>"I got to go."</p>

<p>"What are you, henpecked?"</p>

<p>"No kidding. I been out too much lately. My old lady. . . ."</p>

<p>Lee wasn't listening. He had just seen Allerton stroll by outside the door and look in. Allerton had not  greeted  Lee,  but  walked  on  after  a  momentary  pause.  "I  was  in  the  shadow,"  Lee  thought.</p>

<p>"He couldn't see me from the door." Lee did not notice Cochan's departure.</p>

<p>On a sudden impulse he rushed out the door. Allerton was half a block away. Lee overtook him.</p>

<p>Allerton turned, raising  his  eyebrows,  which  were straight  and black as a pen stroke.  He looked surprised and a bit alarmed, since he was dubious of Lee's sanity. Lee improvised desperately.</p>

<p>"I just wanted to tell you Mary was in Lola's a little while ago. She asked me to tell you she would be in the Ship Ahoy later on, around five." This was partly true. Mary had been in and had asked Lee if he had seen Allerton.</p>

<p>Allerton was relieved. "Oh, thank you," he said, quite cordial now. "Will you be around tonight?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I think so." Lee nodded and smiled, and turned away quickly.</p>

<p>Lee left  his  apartment  for  the Ship  Ahoy  just  before  five. Allerton  was  sitting  at the  bar.  Lee  sat down and ordered a drink, then turned to Allerton with a casual greeting, as though they were on familiar  and  friendly  terms.  Allerton  returned  the  greeting  automatically  before  he  realized  that Lee had somehow established himself on a familiar basis, whereas he had previously decided to have as little to do with Lee as possible. Allerton had a talent for ignoring people, but he was not competent at dislodging someone from a position already occupied.</p>

<p>Lee  began  talking—casual,  unpretentiously  intelligent,  dryly  humorous.  Slowly  he  dispelled Allerton's impression that he was a peculiar and undesirable character. When Mary arrived, Lee greeted her with a tipsy old-world gallantry and, excusing himself, left them to a game of chess.</p>

<p>"Who is he?" asked Mary when Lee had gone outside.</p>

<p>"I have no idea," said Allerton. Had he ever met Lee? He could not be sure. Formal introductions were not expected among the G.I. students. Was Lee a student? Allerton had never seen him at the  school.  There  was  nothing  unusual  in  talking  to  someone  you  didn't  know,  but  Lee  put Allerton on guard. The man was somehow familiar to him. When Lee talked, he seemed to mean more  than  what  he  said.  A  special  emphasis  to  a  word  or  a  greeting  hinted  at  a  period  of familiarity  in  some  other  time  and  place.  As  though  Lee  were  saying,  "You  know  what  I  mean.</p>

<p>You remember."</p><empty-line /><p>Allerton shrugged  irritably and began arranging the chess pieces on the board. He looked like a sullen child unable to locate the source of his ill temper. After a few minutes of play his customary serenity returned, and he began humming.</p>

<p>It was after midnight when Lee returned to the Ship Ahoy. Drunks seethed around the bar, talking as if everyone else were stone deaf. Allerton stood on the edge of this group, apparently unable to make himself heard. He greeted Lee warmly, pushed in to the bar, and emerged with two rum Cokes. "Let's sit down over here," he said.</p>

<p>Allerton  was  drunk.  His  eyes  were flushed  a  faint  violet  tinge,  the  pupils  widely dilated.  He  was talking  very  fast  in  a  high,  thin  voice,  the  eerie,  disembodied  voice  of  a  young  child.  Lee  had never heard Allerton talk like this before. The effect was like the possession voice of a medium.</p>

<p>The boy had an inhuman gaiety and innocence.</p>

<p>Allerton was telling a story about his experience with the Counter-intelligence Corps in Germany.</p>

<p>An informant had been giving the department bum steers.</p>

<p>"How did you check the accuracy of information?" Lee asked. "How did you know ninety percent of what your informants told you wasn't fabricated?"</p>

<p>"Actually we didn't, and we got sucked in on a lot of phony deals. Of course, we cross-checked all information with other informants and we had our own agents in the field. Most of our informants turned in some phony information, but this one character made all of it up. He had our agents out looking  for  a  whole  fictitious  network  of  Russian  spies.  So  finally  the  report  comes  back  from Frankfurt—it is all a lot of crap. But instead of clearing out of town before the information could be checked, he came back with more.</p>

<p>"At  this  point  we'd  really had  enough  of  his  bullshit.  So  we  locked  him  up in  a  cellar.  The  room was pretty cold and uncomfortable, but that was all we could do. We had to handle prisoners very careful.</p>

<p>He kept typing out confessions, enormous things."</p>

<p>This  story  clearly  delighted  Allerton,  and  he  kept  laughing  while  he  was  telling  it.  Lee  was impressed  by  his  combination  of  intelligence  and  childlike  charm.  Allerton  was  friendly  now, without reserve or defense, like a child who has never been hurt. He was telling another story.</p>

<p>Lee watched  the thin  hands, the beautiful violet  eyes,  the flush of excitement on the boy's  face.</p>

<p>An  imaginary  hand  projected  with  such  force  it  seemed  Allerton  must  feel  the  touch  of ectoplasmic fingers caressing his ear, phantom thumbs smoothing his eyebrows, pushing the hair back from his face. Now Lee's hands were running down over the ribs, the stomach. Lee felt the aching pain of desire in his lungs. His mouth was a little open, showing his teeth in the half-snarl of a baffled animal. He licked his lips.</p>

<p>Lee  did  not  enjoy  frustration.  The  limitations  of  his  desires  were  like  the  bars  of  a  cage,  like  a chain  and  collar,  something  he  had  learned  as  an  animal  learns,  through  days  and  years  of experiencing the snub  of the chain, the unyielding bars. He had never resigned himself, and his eyes  looked  out  through  the  invisible  bars,  watchful,  alert,  waiting  for  the  keeper  to  forget  the door, for the frayed collar, the loosened bar . . . suffering without despair and without consent.</p>

<p>"I went to the door and there he was with a branch in his mouth," Allerton was saying.</p>

<p>Lee  had  not  been  listening.  "A  branch  in  his  mouth,"  said  Lee,  then  added  inanely,  "A  big branch?"</p>

<p>"It was about two feet long. I told him to drop dead, then a few minutes later he appeared at the window.  So  I  threw  a  chair  at  him  and  he  jumped  down  to  the  yard  from  the  balcony.  About eighteen  feet.  He  was  very  nimble.  Almost  inhuman.  It  was  sort  of  uncanny,  and  that's  why  I threw the chair. I was scared. We all figured he was putting on an act to get out of the Army."</p>

<p>"What did he look like?" Lee asked.</p>

<p>"Look like? I don't remember especially. He was around eighteen. He looked like a clean-cut boy.</p><empty-line /><p>We  threw  a  bucket  of  cold  water  on  him  and  left  him  on  a  cot  downstairs.  He  began  flopping around  but  he  didn't  say  anything.  We  all  decided  that  was  an  appropriate  punishment.  I  think they took him to the hospital next day."</p>

<p>"Pneumonia?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. Maybe we shouldn't have thrown water on him."</p>

<p>Lee left Allerton at the door of his building.</p>

<p>"You go in here?" Lee asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, I have a sack here."</p>

<p>Lee said good night and walked home.</p>

<p>After  that,  Lee  met  Allerton  every  day  at  five  in  the  Ship  Ahoy.  Allerton  was  accustomed  to choose  his  friends  from  people  older  than  himself,  and  he  looked  forward  to  meeting  Lee.  Lee had conversational routines that Allerton had never heard. But he felt at times oppressed by Lee, as though Lee's presence shut off everything else. He thought he was seeing too much of Lee.</p>

<p>Allerton  disliked  commitments,  and  had  never  been  in  love  or  had  a  close  friend.  He  was  now forced to ask himself: "What does he want from me?" It did not occur to him that Lee was queer, as  he  associated  queerness  with  at  least  some  degree  of  overt  effeminacy.  He  decided  finally that Lee valued him as an audience.</p>

<p><strong>Chapter 3</strong></p>

<p>At  was  a  beautiful,  clear  afternoon  in  April.  Punctually  at  five,  Lee  walked  into  the  Ship  Ahoy.</p>

<p>Allerton  was  at  the  bar  with  Al  Hyman,  a  periodic  alcoholic  and  one  of  the  nastiest,  stupidest, dullest drunks Lee had ever known. He was, on the other hand, intelligent and simple in manner, and nice enough when sober. He was sober now.</p>

<p>Lee had a yellow scarf around his neck, and a pair of two-peso sunglasses. He took off the scarf and dark  glasses  and dropped  them  on the bar.  "A  hard  day  at the  studio,"  he  said,  in affected theatrical accents. He ordered a rum Coke. "You know, it looks like we might bring in an oil well.</p>

<p>They're drilling now over in quadrangle four, and from that rig you could almost spit over into Tex-Mex where I got my hundred-acre cotton farm."</p>

<p>"I always wanted to be an oilman," Hyman said.</p>

<p>Lee looked him over and shook his head. "I'm afraid not. You see, it isn't everybody can qualify.</p>

<p>You must have the calling. First thing, you must look like an oilman. There are no young oilmen.</p>

<p>An oilman should  be  about  fifty.  His  skin is  cracked and  wrinkled  like  mud that  has  dried  in the sun,  and  especially  the  back  of  his  neck  is  wrinkled,  and  the  wrinkles  are  generally  full  of  dust from looking over blocks and quadrangles. He wears gabardine slacks and a white short-sleeved sport shirt. His shoes are covered with fine dust, and a faint haze of dust follows him everywhere like a personal dust storm.</p>

<p>"So you got the calling and the proper appearance. You go around taking up leases. You get five or  six  people  lined  up  to  lease  you  their  land  for  drilling.  You  go  to  the  bank  and  talk  to  the president:  'Now  Clem  Farris,  as  fine  a  man  as  there  is  in  this  Valley  and  smart  too, he's  in  this thing up to his balls, and Old Man Scranton and Fred Crockly and Roy Spigot and Ted Bane, all of them good old boys. Now let me show you a few facts.  I could set here and  gas all morning, taking up your time,  but I know  you're a man accustomed to deal in facts  and figures  and that's exactly what I'm here to show you.'</p>

<p>"He goes out to his car, always a coupe or a roadster—never saw an oilman with a sedan—and reaches in hack of the seat and gets out his maps, a huge bundle of maps as big as carpets. He spreads them out on the bank president's desk, and great clouds of dust spring up from the maps and fill the bank. "'You see this quadrangle here? That's Tex-Mex. Now there's a fault runs right along here through Jed Marvin's place. I saw Old Jed too, the other day when I was out there, a good old boy. There isn't a finer man in this Valley than Jed Marvin. Well now, Socony drilled right over here.'</p>

<p>"He  spreads  out  more  maps.  He  pulls  over  another  desk  and  anchors  the  maps  down  with cuspidors.  'Well,  they  brought  in  a  dry  hole,  and  this  map.  .  .  .'  He  unrolls  another  one.  'Now  if you'll kindly sit on the other end so it don't roll up on us, I'll show you exactly why it was a dry hole and why they should never have drilled there in the first place, 'cause you can see just where this here  fault  runs  smack  between  Jed's  artesian  well  and  the  Tex-Mex  line  over  into  quadrangle four. Now that block was surveyed last time in 1922. I guess you know the old boy done the job.</p>

<p>Earl Hoot was his name, a good old boy too. He had his home up in Nacogdoches, but his son-in-law  owned  a  place  down  here,  the  old  Brooks  place  up  north  of  Tex-Mex,  just  across  the  line from. . . .'</p>

<p>"By  this  time  the  president  is  punchy  with  boredom,  and  the  dust  is  getting  down  in  his  lungs-oilmen are constitutionally immune to the effects of dust—so he says, 'Well, if it's good enough for those boys I guess it's good enough for me. I'll go along.'</p>

<p>"So the oilman goes back and pulls the same routine on his prospects. Then he gets a geologist down  from  Dallas  or  somewhere,  who  talks  some  gibberish  about  faults  and  seepage  and intrusions and shale and sand, and selects some place, more or less at random, to start drilling.</p>

<p>"Now the driller. He has to be a real rip-snorting character. They look for him in Boy's Town—the whore  district  in  border  towns—and  they  find  him  in  a  room  full  of  empty  bottles  with  three whores. So they bust a bottle over his head and drag him out and sober him up, and he looks at the drilling site and spits and says, 'Well, it's your hole.'</p>

<p>"Now  if  the  well  turns  out  dry  the  oilman  says,  'Well,  that's  the  way  it  goes.  Some  holes  got lubrication,  and some is dry as a  whore's cunt  on Sunday morning.' There  was  one oilman, Dry Hole Dutton they called him—all right, Allerton, no cracks about Vaseline—brought in twenty dry holes before he got cured. That means 'get rich,' in the salty lingo of the oil fraternity."</p>

<p>Joe Guidry came in, and Lee slid off his stool to shake hands. He was hoping Joe would bring up the  subject  of  queerness  so  he  could  gauge  Allerton's  reaction.  He  figured  it  was  time  to  let Allerton know what the score was—such a thing as playing it too cool.</p>

<p>They sat down at a table. Somebody had stolen Guidry's radio, his riding boots and wrist watch.</p>

<p>"The trouble with me is," said Guidry, "I like the type that robs me."</p>

<p>"Where you make your mistake is bringing them to your apartment," Lee said, "That's what hotels are for."</p>

<p>"You're  right  there.  But  half  the  time  I  don't  have  money  for  a  hotel.  Besides,  I  like  someone around to cook breakfast and sweep the place out."</p>

<p>"Clean the place out."</p>

<p>"I don't mind the watch and the radio, but it really hurt, losing those boots. They were a thing of beauty and a joy forever." Guidry leaned forward, and glanced at Allerton. "I don't know whether I ought to say things like this in front of Junior here. No offense, kid."</p>

<p>"Go ahead," said Allerton.</p>

<p>"Did I tell you how I made the cop on the beat?</p>

<p>He's the vigilante, the watchman out where I live. Every time he sees the light on in my room, he comes  in  for  a  shot  of  rum.  Well,  about  five  nights  ago  he  caught  me  when  I  was  drunk  and horny, and one thing led to another and I ended up showing him how the cow ate the cabbage. . .</p>

<p>.</p>

<p>"So  the  night  after  I  make  him  I  was  walking  by  the  beer  joint  on  the  corner  and  he  comes  out borracho  and  says,  'Have  a  drink.'  I  said,  'I  don't  want  a  drink,'  So  he  takes  out  his  pistola  and says,  'Have  a  drink.'  I  proceeded  to  take  his  pistola  away  from  him,  and  he  goes  into  the  beer joint  to  phone  for  reinforcements.  So  I  had  to  go  in  and  rip  the  phone  off  the  wall.  Now  they're billing me for the phone. When I got back to my room, which is on the ground floor, he had written</p>

<p>'El  Puto  Gringo'  on  the  window  with  soap.  So,  instead  of  wiping  it  off,  I  left  it  there.  It  pays  to advertise."</p>

<p>The drinks kept coming. Allerton went to the W.C. and got in a conversation at the bar when he returned. Guidry was accusing Hyman of being queer and pretending not to be. Lee was trying to explain  to  Guidry that  Hyman  wasn't  really  queer,  and  Guidry  said  to  him,  "He's  queer  and  you aren't, Lee. You just go around pretending you're queer to get in on the act."</p>

<p>"Who wants to get in on your tired old act?" Lee said. He saw Allerton at the bar talking to John Dumé</p>

<p>Dume  belonged  to  a  small  clique  of  queers  who  made  their  headquarters  in  a  beer  joint  on Campeche  called  The  Green  Lantern.  Dumé  himself  was  not  an  obvious  queer,  but  the  other Green Lantern boys were screaming fags who would not have been welcome at the Ship Ahoy.</p>

<p>Lee walked over to the  bar  and started  talking to the  bartender.  He thought,  "I hope  Dumé tells him about me." Lee felt uncomfortable in dramatic "something-I-have-to-tell-you" routines and he knew, from unnerving experience, the difficulties of a casual come-on: "I'm  queer, you know, by the way." Sometimes they don't hear right and yell, "What?" Or you toss in: "If you were as queer as I am." The other yawns and changes the subject, and you don't know whether he understood or not.</p>

<p>The bartender was saying, "She asks me why I drink. What can I tell her? I don't know why. Why did you have the monkey on your back? Do you know why? There isn't any why, but try to explain that to someone like Jerri. Try to explain that to any woman." Lee nodded sympathetically. "She says  to  me,  why  don't  you  get  more  sleep  and  eat  better?  She  don't  understand  and  I  can't explain it. Nobody can explain it."</p>

<p>The  bartender moved away to  wait on some  customers.  Dumé came  over to Lee. "How  do  you like this character?" he said, indicating Allerton with a wave of his beer bottle. Allerton was across the room talking to Mary and a chess player from Peru. "He comes to me and says, 'I thought you were one of the Green Lantern boys.' So I said, "Well, I am.' He wants me to take him around to some of the gay places here."</p>

<p>Lee and Allerton went to see Cocteau's Orpheus. In the dark theater Lee could feel his body pull towards  Allerton,  an  amoeboid  protoplasmic  projection,  straining  with  a  blind  worm  hunger  to enter  the other's  body,  to breathe  with his  lungs,  see  with his  eyes,  learn the  feel  of  his  viscera and  genitals.  Allerton  shifted  in  his  seat.  Lee  felt  a  sharp  twinge,  a  strain  or  dislocation  of  the spirit. His eyes ached. He took off his glasses and ran his hand over his closed eyes.</p>

<p>When they left the theater, Lee felt exhausted. He fumbled and bumped into things. His voice was toneless  with strain.  He  put  his  hand  up to  his  head  from  time  to time,  an awkward,  involuntary gesture of pain. "I need a drink," he said. He pointed to a bar across the street. "There," he said.</p>

<p>He sat down in a booth and ordered a double tequila. Allerton ordered rum and Coke. Lee drank the tequila straight down, listening down into himself for the effect. He ordered another.</p>

<p>"What did you think of the picture?" Lee asked.</p>

<p>"Enjoyed parts of it."</p>

<p>"Yes."  Lee  nodded,  pursing  his  lips  and  looking  down  into  his  empty  glass.  "So  did  I."  He pronounced the words very carefully, like an elocution teacher.</p>

<p>"He  always  gets  some  innaresting  effects."  Lee  laughed.  Euphoria  was  spreading  from  his stomach. He drank half the second tequila. "The innaresting thing about Cocteau is his ability to bring the myth alive in modern terms."</p>

<p>"Ain't it the truth?" said Allerton.</p>

<p>They  went  to  a  Russian  restaurant  for  dinner.  Lee  looked  through  the  menu.  "By  the  way,"  he said, "the law was in putting the bite on the Ship Ahoy again. Vice squad. Two hundred pesos. I can see them in the station house after a hard day shaking down citizens of the Federal District.</p>

<p>One cop says, 'Ah, Gonzalez, you should see what I got today. Oh la la, such a bite!"</p>

<p>"'Aah,  you  shook  down  a  puto  queer  for  two  pesetas  in  a  bus  station  crapper.  We  know  you, Hernandez, and your cheap tricks. You're the cheapest cop inna Federal District.'"</p>

<p>Lee  waved  to  the  waiter.  "Hey,  Jack.  Dos  martinis,  much  dry.  Seco.  And  dos  plates  Sheeshka Babe. Sabe?n</p>

<p>The waiter nodded. "That's two dry martinis and two orders of shish kebab. Right, gentlemen?"</p>

<p>"Solid, Pops. . . . So how was your evening with Dumé?"</p>

<p>"We  went  to  several  bars  full  of  queers.  One  place  a  character  asked  me  to  dance  and propositioned me."</p>

<p>"Take him up?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Dumé is a nice fellow."</p>

<p>Allerton  smiled.  "Yes,  but  he  is  not  a  person  I  would  confide  too  much  in.  That  is,  anything  I wanted to keep private."</p>

<p>"You refer to a specific indiscretion?"</p>

<p>"Frankly, yes."</p>

<p>"I see." Lee thought, "Dumé never misses."</p>

<p>The  waiter put two martinis on the table. Lee held his martini up to the candle, looking at it with distaste. "The inevitable watery martini with a decomposing olive," he said.</p>

<p>Lee bought a lottery ticket from a boy of ten or so, who had rushed in when the waiter went to the kitchen.  The  boy  was  working  the  last-ticket  routine.  Lee  paid  him  expansively,  like  a  drunk American.</p>

<p>"Go buy yourself some marijuana, son," he said. The boy smiled and turned to leave. "Come back in five years and make an easy ten pesos," Lee called after him.</p>

<p>Allerton smiled. "Thank god," Lee thought. "I won't have to contend with middle-class morality."</p>

<p>"Here you are, sir," said the waiter, placing the shish kebab on the table.</p>

<p>Lee  ordered  two  glasses  of  red  wine.  "So  Dumé  told  you  about  my,  uh,  proclivities?"  he  said abruptly.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Allerton, his mouth full.</p>

<p>"A curse. Been in our family for generations. The Lees have always been perverts. I shall never forget  the  unspeakable  horror  that  froze  the  lymph  in  my  glands—the  lymph  glands  that  is,  of course— when the baneful word seared my reeling brain: <strong>I was a homosexual</strong>. I thought of the painted,  simpering  female  impersonators  I  had  seen  in  a  Baltimore  night  club.  Could  it  be possible that I was one of those subhuman things? I walked the streets in a daze, like a man with a  light  concussion—just  a  minute,  Doctor  Kildare,  this  isn't  your  script.  I  might  well  have destroyed myself, ending an existence  which seemed to offer  nothing but grotesque  misery and humiliation. Nobler, I thought, to die a man than live on, a sex monster. It was a wise old queen—</p>

<p>Bobo, we called her—who taught me that I had a duty to live and to bear my burden proudly for all  to see,  to  conquer  prejudice  and  ignorance  and  hate  with knowledge  and  sincerity  and  love.</p>

<p>Whenever  you  are  threatened  by  a  hostile  presence,  you  emit  a  thick  cloud  of  love  like  an octopus squirts out ink. . . .</p>

<p>"Poor Bobo came to a sticky end. He was riding in the Duc de Ventre's Hispano-Suiza when his falling  piles  blew  out  of  the car  and wrapped  around  the  rear  wheel. He  was  completely  gutted, leaving  an  empty  shell  sitting  there  on  the  giraffe-skin  upholstery.  Even  the  eyes  and  the  brain went, with a horrible  shlupping sound.  The  Duc says  he will carry that ghastly shlup  with him to his mausoleum. . . .</p>

<p>"Then I knew the meaning of loneliness. But Bobo's  words came back to me from the tomb, the sibilants  cracking  gently.  'No  one  is  ever  really  alone.  You  are  part  of  everything  alive.'  The difficulty is to convince someone else he is really part of you, so what the hell? Us parts ought to work together. Reet?"</p>

<p>Lee paused, looking at Allerton speculatively. "Just where do I stand with the kid?" he wondered.</p>

<p>He  had  listened  politely,  smiling  at  intervals.  "What  I  mean  is,  Allerton,  we  are  all  parts  of  a tremendous  whole.  No  use  fighting  it."  Lee  was  getting  tired  of  the  routine.  He  looked  around restlessly for some place to put it down. "Don't these gay bars depress you? Of course, the queer bars here aren't to compare with Stateside queer joints."</p>

<p>"I wouldn't know," said Allerton. "I've never been in any queer joints except those Dumé took me to. I guess there's kicks and kicks."</p>

<p>"You haven't, really?"</p>

<p>"No, never."</p>

<p>Lee paid the bill and they walked out into the cool night. A crescent moon was clear and green in the sky. They walked aimlessly.</p>

<p>"Shall we go to my place for a drink? I have some Napoleon brandy."</p>

<p>"All right," said AUerton.</p>

<p>'This is a completely unpretentious little brandy, you understand, none of this tourist treacle with obvious  effects  of  flavoring,  appealing  to  the  mass  tongue.  My  brandy  has  no  need  of  shoddy devices to shock and coerce the palate. Come along." Lee called a cab.</p>

<p>'Three pesos to Insurgentes and Monterrey," Lee said to the driver in his atrocious Spanish. The driver said four. Lee waved him on. The driver muttered something, and opened the door.</p>

<p>Inside,  Lee  turned  to  Allerton.  'The  man plainly harbors  subversive  thoughts.  You  know,  when I was  at  Princeton,  Communism  was  the  thing.  To  come  out  flat  for  private  property and  a  class society,  you marked  yourself  a  stupid  lout  or  suspect  to be  a  High  Episcopalian  pederast.  But  I held out against the infection—of Communism I mean, of course."</p>

<p>"Aquí." Lee handed three pesos to the driver, who muttered some more and started the car with a vicious clash of gears.</p>

<p>"Sometimes I think they don't like us," said Allerton.</p>

<p>"I  don't  mind  people  disliking  me,"  Lee  said.  "The  question  is,  what  are  they  in  a  position  to  do about it? Apparently nothing, at present. They don't have the green light. This driver, for example, hates  gringos.  But  if  he  kills  someone—and  very  possibly  he  will—it  will  not  be  an  American.  It will be another Mexican. Maybe his good friend. Friends are less frightening than strangers."</p>

<p>Lee opened  the  door  of his  apartment  and turned on  the light. The  apartment  was pervaded  by seemingly  hopeless  disorder.  Here  and  there,  ineffectual  attempts  had  been  made  to  arrange things in piles. There were no lived-in touches. No pictures, no decorations. Clearly, none of the furniture  was his. But Lee's presence permeated the apartment.  A coat over the back  of a chair and a hat on the table were immediately recognizable as belonging to Lee.</p>

<p>"I'll fix you a drink." Lee got two water glasses from the kitchen and poured two inches of Mexican brandy in each glass.</p>

<p>Allerton tasted the brandy. "Good Lord," he said. "Napoleon must have pissed in this one."</p>

<p>"I was afraid of that. An untutored palate. Your generation has never learned the pleasures that a trained palate confers on the disciplined few."</p>

<p>Lee took a long drink of the brandy. He attempted an ecstatic "aah," inhaled some of the brandy, and  began  to  cough.  "It  is  god-awful,"  he  said  when  he  could  talk.  "Still,  better  than  California brandy. It has a suggestion of cognac taste."</p>

<p>There was a long silence. Allerton was sitting with his head leaning back against the couch. His eyes were half closed.</p>

<p>"Can I show you over the house?" said Lee, standing up. "In here we have the bedroom."</p>

<p>Allerton got to his feet slowly. They went into the bedroom, and Allerton lay down on the bed and lit a cigarette. Lee sat in the only chair.</p>

<p>"More brandy?" Lee asked. Allerton nodded. Lee sat down on the edge of the bed, and filled his glass and handed it to him. Lee touched his sweater. "Sweet stuff, dearie," he said. "That wasn't made in Mexico."</p>

<p>"I bought it in Scotland," he said. He began to hiccough violently, and got up and rushed for the bathroom.</p>

<p>Lee stood in the doorway. "Too bad," he said.</p>

<p>"What could be the matter? You didn't drink much." He filled a glass with water and handed it to Allerton. "You all right now?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, I think so." Allerton lay down on the bed again.</p>

<p>Lee  reached  out  a  hand  and  touched  Allerton's  ear,  and  caressed  the  side  of  his  face.  Allerton reached up and covered one of Lee's hands and squeezed it.</p>

<p>"Let's get this sweater off."</p>

<p>"O.K.," said Allerton. He took off the sweater and then lay down again. Lee took off his own shoes and  shirt.  He  opened  Allerton's  shirt  and  ran  his  hand  down  Allerton's  ribs  and  stomach,  which contracted beneath his fingers. "God, you're skinny," he said.</p>

<p>"I'm pretty small."</p>

<p>Lee took off Allerton's shoes and socks. He loosened Allerton's belt and unbuttoned his trousers.</p>

<p>Allerton  arched  his  body,  and  Lee  pulled  the  trousers  and  drawers  off.  He  dropped  his  own trousers and shorts and lay down beside him. Allerton responded without hostility or disgust, but in his eyes Lee saw a curious detachment, the impersonal calm of an animal or a child.</p>

<p>Later, when they lay side by side smoking, Lee said, "Oh, by the way, you said you had a camera in pawn  you were about to lose?" It occurred  to Lee that to bring the matter up at this time  was not tactful, but he decided the other was not the type to take offense.</p>

<p>"Yes. In for four hundred pesos. The ticket runs out next Wednesday."</p>

<p>"Well, let's go down tomorrow and get it out." Allerton raised one bare shoulder off the sheet.</p>

<p>"O.K.,"he said.</p>

<p><strong>Chapter 4</strong></p>

<p>Friday  night  Allerton  went  to  work.  He  was  taking  his  roommate's  place  proofreading  for  an English newspaper.</p>

<p>Saturday  night  Lee  met  Allerton  in  the  Cuba,  a  bar  with  an  interior  like  the  set  for  a  surrealist ballet. The walls were covered with murals depicting underwater scenes. Mermaids and mermen in  elaborate  arrangements  with  huge  goldfish  stared  at  the  customers  with  fixed,  identical expressions  of  pathic  dismay.  Even  the  fish  were  invested  with  an  air  of  ineffectual  alarm.  The effect was disquieting, as though these androgynous beings were frightened by something behind or to one side of the customers, who were made uneasy by this inferred presence. Most of them took their business someplace else.</p><empty-line /><p>Allerton was somewhat sullen, and Lee felt depressed and ill at ease until he had put down two martinis. "You know, Allerton . . . ," he said after a long silence. Allerton was humming to himself, drumming on the  table  and  looking around restlessly.  Now  he stopped humming, and raised  an eyebrow.</p>

<p>"This  punk  is  getting  too  smart,"  Lee  thought.  He  knew  he  had  no  way  of  punishing  him  for indifference or insolence.</p>

<p>"They have the most incompetent tailors in Mexico I have encountered in all my experience as a traveller.  Have  you  had  any  work  done?"  Lee  looked  pointedly at  Allerton's  shabby clothes.  He was  as  careless  of  his  clothes  as  Lee  was.  "Apparently  not.  Take  this  tailor  I'm  hung  up  with.</p>

<p>Simple job. I bought a pair of ready-made trousers. Never took time for a fitting. Both of us could get in those pants."</p>

<p>"It wouldn't look right," said Allerton.</p>

<p>"People  would  think  we  were  Siamese  twins.  Did  I  ever  tell  you  about  the  Siamese  twin  who turned  his  brother  in  to  the  law  to  get  him  off  the  junk?  But  to  get  back  to  this  tailor.  I  took  the pants in with another pair. These pants is too voluminous,' I told him. 'I want them sewed down to the same size as this other pair here.' He promised to do the job in two days. That was more than two  months  ago.  'Mañana,'  'más  tarde,'  'ahora,'  'ahorita,'  and  every  time  I  come  to  pick  up  the pants it's 'todavía no'—not yet. Yesterday I had all the 'ahora' routine I can stand still for. So I told him,  'Ready  or  no,  give  me  my  pants.'  The  pants  was  all  cut  down  the  seams.  I  told  him,  Two months and all you have done is disembowel my trousers.' I took them to another tailor and told him, 'Sew them up.' Are you hungry?"</p>

<p>"I am, as a matter of fact."</p>

<p>"How about Pat's Steak House?"</p>

<p>"Good idea."</p>

<p>Pat's  served  excellent  steaks.  Lee  liked  the  place  because  it  was  never  crowded.  At  Pat's  he ordered a double dry martini. Allerton had rum and Coke. Lee began talking about telepathy.</p>

<p>"I know telepathy to be a fact, since I have experienced it myself. I have no interest to prove it, or, in fact, to prove anything to anybody. What interests me is, how can I use it? In South America at the headwaters of the Amazon grows a plant called Yage that is supposed to increase telepathic sensitivity. Medicine  men  use  it  in  their  work.  A  Colombian  scientist,  whose  name  escapes  me, isolated from Yage a drug he called Telepathine. I read all this in a magazine article.</p>

<p>"Later I see another article—the Russians are using Yage in experiments on slave labor. It seems they want to induce states of automatic obedience and ultimately, of course, thought control. The basic con. No build-up, no spiel, no routine, just move in on someone's psyche and give orders. I have a theory the Mayan priests developed a form of one-way telepathy to con the peasants into doing all the work. The deal is certain to backfire eventually, because telepathy is not of its nature a one-way setup, nor a setup of sender and receiver at all.</p>

<p>"By  now  the  U.S.  is  experimenting  with  Yage,  unless  they  are  dumber  even  than  I  think.  Yage may  be  a  means  to  usable  knowledge  of  telepathy.  Anything  that  can  be  accomplished chemically  can  be  accomplished  in  other  ways."  Lee  saw  that  Allerton  was  not  especially interested, and dropped the subject.</p>

<p>"Did  you  read  about  the  old  Jew  who  tried  to  smuggle  out  ten  pounds  of  gold  sewed  in  his overcoat?"</p>

<p>"No. What about it?"</p>

<p>"Well, this old Jew was nailed at the airport on his way to Cuba. I hear they got like a mine finder out at the airport rings a bell if anybody passes the gate with an outlandish quantity of metal on his  person.  So it  says  in  the  papers,  after  they give  this  Jew  a  shake  and find  the  gold,  a  large number  of  Jewish-looking  foreigners  were  seen  looking  into  the  airport  window  in  a  state  of excitement. 'Oy, gefilte fish! They are putting the snatch on Abe!' Back in Roman times the Jews rose  up—in  Jerusalem  I  think  it was—and  killed  fifty  thousand  Romans.  The  she-Jews—that  is, the young Jewish ladies, I must be careful not to lay myself open to a charge of anti-Semitism—</p>

<p>done strip teases with Roman intestines.</p>

<p>"Speaking of intestines, did I ever tell you about my friend Reggie? One of the unsung heroes of British  Intelligence.  Lost  his  ass  and  ten  feet  of  lower  intestine  in  the  service.  Lived  for  years disguised as an Arab boy known only as 'Number 69' at headquarters. That was wishful thinking, though,  because  the  Arabs  are  strictly  one  way.  Well,  a  rare  Oriental  disease  set  in,  and  poor Reggie lost the bulk of his tripes. For God and country, what? He didn't want any speeches, any medals, just to know that he had served, that was enough. Think of those patient years, waiting for another piece of the jigsaw puzzle to fall into place.</p>

<p>"You never hear of operators like Reggie, but it is their information, gathered in pain and danger, that  gives  some  front-line  general  the  plan  for  a  brilliant  counter-offensive  and  covers  his  chest with medals. For  example, Reggie  was the first  to guess  the enemy  was running  short  of petrol when the K. Y. jelly gave out, and that was only one of his brilliant coups. How about the T-bone steak for two?"</p>

<p>"That's fine."</p>

<p>"Rare?"</p>

<p>"Medium rare."</p>

<p>Lee was looking at the menu. "They list baked Alaska," he said. "Ever eat it?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Real good. Hot on the outside and cold inside."</p>

<p>"That's why they call it baked Alaska I imagine."</p>

<p>"Got an idea for a new dish. Take a live pig and throw it into a very hot oven so the pig is roasted outside and when you cut into it, it's still alive and twitching inside. Or, if we run a dramatic joint, a screaming pig covered with burning brandy rushes out of the kitchen and dies right by your chair.</p>

<p>You can reach down and pull off the crispy, crackly ears and eat them with your cocktails."</p>

<p>Outside, the City lay under a violet haze. A warm spring wind blew through the trees in the park.</p>

<p>They  walked  through  the  park  back  to  Lee's  place,  occasionally  stopping  to  lean  against  each other,  weak  from  laughing.  A  Mexican  said,  "Cabrones,"  as  he  walked  by. Lee  called  after  him,</p>

<p>"Chinga tu madre," then added in English, "Here I come to your little jerkwater country and spend my good American dollars  and what happens? Insulted inna public street." The  Mexican turned, hesitating, Lee unbuttoned his coat and hooked his thumb under the pistol at his waistband. The Mexican walked on.</p>

<p>"Someday they won't walk away," said Lee.</p>

<p>At Lee's apartment they had some brandy. Lee put his arm around Allerton's shoulder.</p>

<p>"Well, if you insist," said Allerton.</p>

<p>Sunday night Allerton had dinner at Lee's apartment. Lee cooked chicken livers, because Allerton always  wanted  to  order  chicken  liver  in  restaurants,  and  usually  restaurant  chicken  liver  isn't fresh. After dinner Lee began making love to Allerton, but he rejected Lee's advances and said he wanted  to  go  to  the  Ship  Ahoy  and  drink  a  rum  Coke.  Lee  turned  out  the  light  and  embraced Allerton before they started out the door. Allerton's body was rigid with annoyance.</p>

<p>When  they  arrived  at  the  Ship  Ahoy,  Lee  went  to  the  bar  and  ordered  two  rum  Cokes.  "Make those extra strong," he said to the bartender.</p>

<p>Allerton  was  sitting  at  a  table  with  Mary.  Lee  brought  the  rum  Coke  over  and  set  it  down  by Allerton. Then he sat down at a table with Joe Guidry. Joe Guidry had a young man with him. The young  man  was  telling  how  he  was  treated  by  an  Army  psychiatrist.  "So  what  did  you  find  out from your psychiatrist?" said Guidry. His voice had a nagging, derogatory edge.</p><empty-line /><p>"I found out I was an Oedipus, I found out I love my mother."</p>

<p>"Why, everybody loves their mother, son," said Guidry.</p>

<p>"I mean I love my mother physically."</p>

<p>"I don't believe that, son," said Guidry. This struck Lee as funny, and he began to laugh.</p>

<p>"I hear Jim Cochan has gone back to the States," said Guidry. "He plans to work in Alaska."</p>

<p>"Thank  God  I  am  a  gentleman  of  independent  means,  and  don't  have  to  expose  myself  to  the inclemencies  of  near-Arctic  conditions,"  said  Lee.  "By  the  way,  did  you  ever  meet  Jim's  wife, Alice? My god, she is an American bitch that won't quit. I never yet see her equal. Jim does not have one friend he can take to the house. She has forbidden him to eat out, as she does not want he should take in any nourishment unless she is there to watch him eat it. Did you ever hear the likes of that? Needless to say, my place is out of bounds to Jim, and he always has that hunted look  when  he  comes  to  see  me.  I  don't  know  why  American  men  put  up  with  such  shit  from  a woman.</p>

<p>Of course I am no expert judge of female flesh, but Alice has 'lousy lay' writ all over her scrawny, unappetizing person."</p>

<p>"You're coming on mighty bitchy tonight, Lee," said Guidry.</p>

<p>"And not without reason. Did I tell you about this Wigg person? He is an American hipster around town,  a  junky  who  is  said  to  play  a  cool  bass  fiddle.  Strictly  on  the  chisel,  even  though  he  has gold, and he's always mooching junk, saying 'No, I don't want to buy any. I'm kicking. I just want half  a  fix.'  I  have  had  all  I  can  stand  still  for  from  this  character.  Driving  around  in a  new  three-thousand-dollar Chrysler, and too cheap to buy his own junk. What am I, the Junky's Benevolent Society for christ sake? This Wigg is as ugly as people get."</p>

<p>"You making it with him?" asked Guidry, which seemed to shock his young friend.</p>

<p>"Not  even.  I  got  bigger  fish  to  fry,"  said  Lee.  He  glanced  over  at  Allerton,  who  was  laughing  at something Mary had said.</p>

<p>"Fish is right," quipped Guidry. "Cold, slippery, and hard to catch."</p>

<p><strong>Chapter 5</strong></p>

<p>Lee  had  an  appointment  with  Allerton  for  eleven  o'clock  Monday  morning  to  go  to  the  National Pawn  Shop  and  get  his  camera  out  of  hock.  Lee  came  to  Allerton's  room  and  woke  him  up exactly at eleven. Allerton was sullen. He seemed on the point of going back to sleep. Finally Lee said, "Well, are you going to get up now, or . . ."</p>

<p>Allerton opened his eyes and blinked like a turtle. "I'm getting up," he said.</p>

<p>Lee sat  down and read  a  newspaper,  careful  to avoid  watching Allerton  dress.  He  was trying to control  his  hurt  and  anger,  and  the  effort  exhausted  him.  A  heavy  drag  slowed  movement  and thought. Lee's face was rigid, his voice toneless. The strain continued through breakfast. Alierton sipped tomato juice in silence.</p>

<p>It took all day to get the camera. Alierton had lost the ticket. They went from one office to another.</p>

<p>The  officials  shook  their  heads  and  drummed  on  the  table,  waiting.  Lee  put  out  two  hundred pesos extra in bites. He finally paid the four hundred pesos, plus interest and various charges. He handed the camera to Alierton, who took it without comment.</p>

<p>They  went  back  to  the  Ship  Ahoy  in  silence.  Lee  went  in  and  ordered  a  drink.  Alierton disappeared. About an hour later he came in and sat with Lee.</p>

<p>"How about dinner tonight?" asked Lee.</p>

<p>Allerton said, "No, I think I'll work tonight."</p><empty-line /><p>Lee was depressed and shattered. The  warmth and laughter of Saturday night  was lost, and he did not know why. In any relation of love or friendship Lee attempted to establish contact on the non-verbal  level of intuition, a silent  exchange  of thought  and feeling. Now Alierton had abruptly shut off contact, and Lee felt a physical pain as though a part of himself tentatively stretched out towards  the  other  had  been  severed,  and  he  was  looking  at  the  bleeding  stump  in  shock  and disbelief.</p>

<p>Lee said, "Like the Wallace administration, I subsidize non-production. I will pay you twenty pesos not to work tonight." Lee was about to develop the idea, but Allerton's impatient coolness stopped him. He fell silent, looking at Allerton with shocked, hurt eyes.</p>

<p>Allerton was nervous and irritable, drumming on the table and looking around. He did not himself understand why Lee annoyed him.</p>

<p>"How about a drink?" Lee said.</p>

<p>"No. Not now. Anyway, I have to go."</p>

<p>Lee got up jerkily. "Well, I'll see you," he said. "I'll see you tomorrow."</p>

<p>"Yes. Good night."</p>

<p>He  left  Lee  standing  there,  trying  to  formulate  a  plan  to  keep  Allerton  from  going,  to  make  an appointment for the next day, to mitigate in some way the hurt he had received.</p>

<p>Allerton was gone. Lee felt for the back of his chair and lowered himself into it, like a man weak from illness. He stared at the table, his thoughts slow, as if he were very cold.</p>

<p>The bartender placed a sandwich in front of Lee. "Huh?" said Lee. "What's this?"</p>

<p>"The sandwich you ordered."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes." Lee took a few bites out of the sandwich, washing it down with water. "On my bill, Joe,"</p>

<p>he called to the bartender.</p>

<p>He  got up and  walked  out.  He  walked  slowly.  Several  times  he leaned  on a  tree,  looking  at the ground as if his stomach hurt. Inside his apartment he took off his coat and shoes, and sat down on the bed. His throat began to ache, moisture hit his eyes, and he fell across the bed, sobbing convulsively.  He  pulled  his  knees  up  and  covered  his  face  with  his  hands,  the  fists  clenched.</p>

<p>Towards  morning  he  turned  on  his  back  and  stretched  out.  The  sobs  stopped,  and  his  face relaxed in the morning light.</p>

<p>Lee woke up around noon, and sat for a long time on the edge of the bed with one shoe dangling from his hand. He dabbed water on his eyes, put on his coat, and went out.</p>

<p>Lee  went  down  to  the  Zócalo  and  wandered  around  for  several  hours.  His  mouth  was  dry.  He went into a Chinese restaurant, sat down in a booth and ordered a Coke. Misery spread through his  body,  now  that  he  was  sitting  down  with  no  motion  to  distract  him.  "What  happened?"  he wondered.</p>

<p>He forced himself to look at the facts. Allerton was not queer enough to make a reciprocal relation possible. Lee's affection irritated him. Like many people who have nothing to do, he was resentful of any claims on his time. He had no close friends. He disliked definite appointments. He did not like  to  feel  that  anybody  expected  anything  from  him.  He  wanted,  so  far  as  possible,  to  live without external pressure. Allerton resented Lee's action in paying to recover the camera. He felt he was "being sucked in on a phony deal," and that an obligation he did not want had been thrust upon him.</p>

<p>Allerton did not recognize friends who made six-hundred-peso gifts, nor could he feel comfortable exploiting  Lee.  He  made  no  attempt  to  clarify  the  situation.  He  did  not  want  to  see  the contradiction involved in resenting a favor which he accepted. Lee found that he could tune in on Allerton's  viewpoint,  though  the  process  caused  him  pain,  since  it  involved  seeing  the  extent  of Allerton's  indifference.  "I liked  him  and I  wanted him  to like me," Lee thought.  "I wasn't  trying  to buy anything."</p><empty-line /><p>"I have to leave town," he decided. "Go somewhere. Panama, South America." He went down to the station to find out when the next train left for Veracruz. There was a train that night, but he did not  buy  a  ticket.  A  feeling  of  cold  desolation  came  over  him  at  the  thought  of  arriving  alone  in another country, far away from Allerton.</p>

<p>Lee took a cab to the Ship Ahoy. Allerton was not there, and Lee sat at the bar for three hours, drinking. Finally Allerton looked in the door, waved to Lee vaguely, and went upstairs with Mary.</p>

<p>Lee knew they had probably gone to the owner's apartment, where they often ate dinner.</p>

<p>He went up to Tom Weston's apartment. Mary and Allerton were there. Lee sat down and tried to engage Allerton's interest, but he was too drunk to make sense. His attempt to carry on a casual, humorous conversation was painful to watch.</p>

<p>Ale must have slept. Mary and Allerton were gone. Tom Weston brought him some hot coffee. He drank the coffee, got up and staggered out of the apartment. Exhausted, he slept till the following morning.</p>

<p>Scenes  from  the  chaotic,  drunken  month  passed  before  his  eyes.  There  was  a  face  he  did  not recognize, a good-looking kid with amber eyes, yellow hair and beautiful straight black eyebrows.</p>

<p>He saw himself asking someone he barely knew to buy him a beer in a bar on Insurgentes, and getting a nasty brush. He saw himself pull a gun on someone who followed him out of a clip joint on Coahuila and tried to roll him. He felt the friendly, steadying hands of people who had helped him home. "Take it easy, Bill." His childhood friend Rollins standing there, solid and virile, with his elkhound.  Carl  running  for  a  streetcar.  Moor  with  his  malicious  hitch  smile.  The  faces  blended together  in  a  nightmare,  speaking  to  him  in  strange  moaning  idiot  voices  that  he  could  not understand at first, and finally could not hear.</p>

<p>Lee  got  up  and  shaved  and  felt  better.  He  found  he  could  eat  a  roll  and  drink  some  coffee.  He smoked and read the paper, trying not to think about Allerton. Presently he went downtown and looked  through  the  gun  stores.  He  found  a  bargain  in  a  Colt  Frontier,  which  he  bought  for  two hundred  pesos.  A  32-20  in  perfect  condition,  serial  number  in  the  three  hundred  thousands.</p>

<p>Worth at least a hundred dollars Stateside.</p>

<p>Lee  went  to  the  American  bookstore  and  bought  a  book  on  chess.  He  took  the  book  out  to Chapultepec, sat down in a soda stand on the lagoon, and began to read. Directly in front of him was  an  island  with  a  huge  cypress  tree  growing  on  it.  Hundreds  of  vultures  roosted  in  the  tree.</p>

<p>Lee wondered what they ate. He threw a piece of bread, which landed on the island. The vultures paid no attention.</p>

<p>Lee  was  interested  in  the  theory  of  games  and  the  strategy  of  random  behavior.  As  he  had supposed,  the  theory  of  games  does  not  apply  to  chess,  since  chess  rules  out  the  element  of chance and approaches elimination of the unpredictable human factor. If the mechanism of chess were completely understood, the outcome could be predicted after any initial move. "A game for thinking machines," Lee thought. He read on, smiling from time to time. Finally he got up, sailed the book out over the lagoon, and walked away.</p>

<p>Lee  knew  he  could  not  find  what  he  wanted  with  Allerton.  The  court  of  fact  had  rejected  his petition. But Lee could not give up. "Perhaps I can discover a way to change fact," he thought. He was ready to take any risk, to proceed to any extreme of action. Like a saint or a wanted criminal with  nothing  to  lose,  Lee  had  stepped  beyond  the  claims  of  his  nagging,  cautious,  aging, frightened flesh.</p>

<p>He  took  a  taxi  to  the  Ship  Ahoy.  Allerton  was  standing  in  front  of  the  Ship  Ahoy,  blinking sluggishly in the sunlight. Lee looked at him and smiled. Allerton smiled back.</p>

<p>"How are you?"</p>

<p>"Sleepy.  Just  got  up."  He  yawned  and  started  into  the  Ship  Ahoy.  He  moved  one  hand—"See you"— and  sat  down at the  bar  and ordered  tomato  juice. Lee  went in  and sat  beside  him,  and ordered a double rum Coke. Allerton moved and sat down at a table with Tom Weston. "Bring the tomato juice over here, will you, Joe?" he called to the bartender.</p><empty-line /><p>Lee  sat  at  the  table  next  to  Allerton's.  Tom  Weston  was  leaving.  Allerton  followed  him  out.  He came back in and sat in the other room, reading the papers. Mary came in and sat down with him.</p>

<p>After talking for a few minutes, they set up the chess board.</p>

<p>Lee had thrown down three drinks. He walked over and pulled up a chair to the table where Mary and Allerton were playing chess. "Howdy," he said. "Don't mind if I kibitz?"</p>

<p>Mary looked up annoyed, but smiled when she met Lee's steady, reckless gaze.</p>

<p>"I was reading up on chess. Arabs invented it, and I'm not surprised. Nobody can sit like an Arab.</p>

<p>The  classical  Arab  chess  game  was  simply  a  sitting  contest.  When  both  contestants  starved  to death it was a stalemate." Lee paused and took a long drink.</p>

<p>"During the Baroque period of chess the practice of harrying your opponent with some annoying mannerism came into general use. Some players used dental floss, others cracked their joints or blew saliva bubbles. The  method was constantly developed. In the 1917 match at Baghdad, the Arab Arachnid  Khayam  defeated  the German master Kurt Schlemiel by  humming 'I'll Be Around When You're Gone' forty-thousand times, and each time reaching his hand towards the board as if he intended to make a move. Schlemiel went into convulsions finally.</p>

<p>"Did you ever have the good fortune to see the Italian master Tetrazzini perform?" Lee lit Mary's cigarette. "I say 'perform' advisedly, because he was a great showman, and like all showmen, not above charlatanism and at times downright trickery. Sometimes he used smoke screens  to hide his maneuvers from the opposition—I mean literal smoke screens, of course. He had a corps of trained idiots who would rush in at a given signal and eat all the pieces. With defeat staring him in the face—as it often did, because actually he knew nothing of chess but the rules and wasn't too sure  of  those—he  would  leap  up  yelling,  'You  cheap  bastard!  I  saw  you  palm  that  queen!'  and ram  a  broken  teacup  into  his  opponent's  face.  In  1922  he  was  rid  out  of  Prague  on  a  rail.  The next  time  I  saw  Tetrazzini  was  in  the  Upper  Ubangi.  A  complete  wreck.  Peddling  unlicensed condoms. That was the year of the rinderpest, when everything died, even the hyenas."</p>

<p>Lee paused. The routine was coming to him like dictation. He did not know what he was going to say  next,  but  he suspected  the monologue  was about  to get dirty.  He  looked at Mary.  She  was exchanging  significant  glances  with  Allerton.  "Some  sort  of  lover  code,"  Lee  decided.  "She  is telling him they have to go now." Allerton got up, saying he had to have a haircut before going to work. Mary and Allerton left. Lee was alone in the bar.</p>

<p>The monologue continued. "I was working as Aide-de-camp under General Von Klutch. Exacting.</p>

<p>A  hard  man  to  satisfy.  I  gave  up  trying  after  the  first  week.  We  had  a  saying  around  the wardroom: 'Never expose your flank to old Klutchy.' Well, I couldn't take Klutchy another night, so I  assembled  a  modest  caravan  and  hit  the  trail  with  Abdul,  the  local  Adonis.  Ten  miles  out  of Tanhajaro, Abdul came down with the rinderpest and I had to leave him there to die. Hated to do it, but there was no other way. Lost his looks completely, you understand.</p>

<p>"At the  headwaters  of  the Zambesi, I  ran  into an old  Dutch  trader.  After  considerable haggling  I gave him a keg of paregoric for a boy, half Effendi and half Lulu. I figured the boy would get me as far as Timbuktu, maybe all the way to Dakar. But the Lulu-Effendi was showing signs of wear even  before  I  hit  Timbuktu,  and  I  decided  to  trade  him  in  on  a  straight  Bedouin  model.  The crossbreeds make  a  good appearance,  but  they  don't  hold up.  In Timbuktu I went to Corn  Hole Gus's Used-Slave Lot to see what he could do for me on a trade-in.</p>

<p>"Gus  rushes  out  and  goes  into  the  spiel:  'Ah,  Sahib  Lee.  Allah  has  sent  you!  I  have  something right  up  your  ass,  I  mean,  alley.  Just  came  in.  One  owner  and  he  was  a  doctor.  A  once-over-lightly, twice-a-week-type citizen. It's young and it's tender. In fact, it talks baby talk . . . behold!'</p>

<p>"'You call those senile slobberings baby talk? My grandfather got a clap off that one. Come again, Gussie. '</p>

<p>"'You do not like it? A pity. Well, everyone has a taste, feller say. Now here I have a one-hundred-percent desert-bred Bedouin  with a pedigree goes straight back to the Prophet.  Dig his bearing.</p>

<p>Such pride! Such fire!'</p><empty-line /><p>"'A good appearance job, Gus, but not good enough. It's an albino Mongolian idiot. Look, Gussie, you are dealing with the oldest faggot in the Upper Ubangi, so come off the peg. Reach down into your grease pit and dredge out the best-looking punk you got in this moth-eaten bazaar.'</p>

<p>"'All  right  Sahib  Lee,  you  want  quality,  right?  Follow  me,  please.  Here  it  is.  What  can  I  say?</p>

<p>Quality speaks for itself. Now, I get a lotta cheap-type customers in here wanna see quality and then scream at the price. But you know and I know that quality runs high. As a matter of fact, and this I swear by the Prophet's prick, I lose money on this quality merchandise.'</p>

<p>"'Uh huh. Got some hidden miles on him, but he'll do. How about a trial run?'</p>

<p>"'Lee,  for  christ  sake,  I  don't  run  a  house.  This  joint  is  strictly  package.  No  consumption  on premises. I could lose my license.'</p>

<p>"'I  don't  aim  to  get  caught  short  with  one  of  your  Scotch-tape  and  household-cement reconditioned  jobs  a  hundred  miles  from  the  nearest  Soukh.  Besides,  how  do  I  know  it  ain't  a Liz?'</p>

<p>"'Sahib Lee! This is an ethical lot!'</p>

<p>"'I was beat that way one time in Marrakesh. Citizen passed a transvestite Jew  Lizzie on me as an Abyssinian prince.'</p>

<p>"'Ha ha ha, full of funny jokes, aren't  you? How is this: stay over in town tonight  and try it out. If you don't want it in the morning, I refund every piaster. Fair enough?'</p>

<p>"'O. K., now,  what can  you give me on this Lulu-Effendi? Perfect  condition. Just  overhauled.  He don't eat much and he don't say nothing.'</p>

<p>"'Jesus, Lee! You know I'd cut off my right nut for you, but I swear by my mother's cunt, may I fall down  and  be  paralyzed  and  my  prick  fall  off  if  these  mixed  jobs  ain't  harder  to  move  than  a junky's bowels.'</p>

<p>"'Skip the routine. How much?' "Gus stands in front of the Lulu-Effendi with his hands on his hips.</p>

<p>He smiles and shakes his head. He  walks around the boy. He reaches  in and points to a small, slightly varicose vein behind the knee. 'Look at that,' he says, still smiling and shaking his head.</p>

<p>He walks around again. . . . 'Got piles too.' He shakes his head. 'I don't know. I really don't know what to say to you. Open up, kid. . . . Two teeth missing.' Gus has stopped smiling. He is talking in low, considerate tones, like an undertaker.</p>

<p>"'I'm going to be honest  with you, Lee. I've got a lotful of this stuff now. I'd rather just forget this job and talk cash on the other.'</p>

<p>"'What am I going to do with it? Peddle it on the public street?'</p>

<p>"'Might take it along as a spare. Ha, ha. . . .'</p>

<p>"'Ha. What can you give me?'</p>

<p>"'Well  .  .  .  now  don't  get  mad  .  .  .  two  hundred  piasters.'  Gus  makes  a  skittish  little  run  as  if  to escape my anger, and throws up a huge cloud of dust in the courtyard."</p>

<p>The routine ended suddenly, and Lee looked around. The bar was nearly empty. He paid for his drinks and walked out into the night.</p>

<p><strong>Chapter 6</strong></p>

<p>Thursday  Lee  went  to  the  races,  on  the  recommendation  of  Tom  Weston.  Weston  was  an amateur astrologer, and he assured Lee the signs were right. Lee lost five races, and took a taxi back to the Ship Ahoy.</p>

<p>Mary  and  Allerton  were  sitting  at  a  table  with  the  Peruvian  chess  player.  Allerton  asked  Lee  to come over and sit down at the table.</p><empty-line /><p>"Where's that phony whore caster?" Lee said, looking around.</p>

<p>"Tom give you a bum steer?" asked Allerton.</p>

<p>"He did that."</p>

<p>Mary left with the Peruvian. Lee finished his third drink and turned to Allerton. "I figure to go down to South America soon," he said. "Why don't you come along? Won't cost you a cent."</p>

<p>"Perhaps not in money."</p>

<p>"I'm  not a  difficult man to get along  with. We  could reach  a  satisfactory arrangement. What you got to lose?"</p>

<p>"Independence."</p>

<p>"So who's going to cut in on your independence? You can lay all the women in South America if you want to. All I ask is be nice to Papa, say twice a week. That isn't excessive, is it? Besides, I will buy you a round-trip ticket so you can leave at your discretion."</p>

<p>Allerton shrugged. "I'll think it over," he said. "This job runs ten days more. I'll give you a definite answer when the job folds."</p>

<p>"Your job. . . ." Lee was about to say, "I'll give you ten days' salary." He said, "All right."</p>

<p>Allerton's  newspaper  job  was  temporary,  and  he  was  too  lazy  to  hold  a  job  in  any  case.</p>

<p>Consequently  his answer meant "No." Lee figured to talk  him over in ten days. "Better not force the issue now," he thought.</p>

<p>Allerton planned a three-day trip to Morelia with his co-workers in the newspaper office. The night before he left, Lee was in a state of manic excitement. He collected a noisy table  full of people.</p>

<p>Allerton  was  playing  chess  with  Mary,  and  Lee  made  all  the  noise  he  could.  He  kept  his  table laughing, but they all looked vaguely uneasy, as if they would prefer to be someplace else. They thought Lee was a little crazy. But just when he seemed on the point of some scandalous excess of speech or behavior, he would check himself and say something completely banal.</p>

<p>Lee leaped  up to embrace a new arrival.  "Ricardo! Amigo mío!" he said. "Haven't seen  you in a dog's age. Where you been? Having a baby? Sit down on your ass, or what's left of it after four years in the Navy. What's troubling you, Richard? Is it women? I'm glad you came to me instead of those quacks on the top floor."</p>

<p>At this  point  Allerton and  Mary left, after  consulting for  a moment in low tones.  Lee looked after them  in silence. "I'm  playing  to an empty  house  now,"  he thought.  He  ordered  another  rum  and swallowed four Benzedrine tablets. Then he went into the head and smoked a roach of tea. "Now I will ravish my public," he thought.</p>

<p>The  busboy  had  caught  a  mouse  and  was  holding  it  up  by  the  tail.  Lee  pulled  out  an  old-fashioned .22 revolver he sometimes carried. "Hold the son of a bitch out and I'll blast it," he said, striking  a  Napoleonic  pose.  The  boy  tied  a  string  to  the  mouse's  tail  and  held  it  out  at  arm's length. Lee fired from a distance of three feet. His bullet tore the mouse's head off.</p>

<p>"If you'd got any closer the mouse would have clogged the muzzle," said Richard.</p>

<p>Tom  Weston  came  in.  "Here  comes  the  old  whore  caster,"  Lee  said.  'That  retrograde  Saturn dragging your ass, man?"</p>

<p>"My ass is dragging because I need a beer," said Weston.</p>

<p>"Well,  you've  come  to  the  right  place.  A  beer  for  my  astrologizing  friend.  .  .  .  What's  that?  I'm sorry, old man," Lee said, turning to Weston, "but the bartender say the signs aren't right to serve you a beer.  You see, Venus is in the sixty-ninth house  with a randy Neptune and he couldn't let you  have  a  beer  under  such  auspices."  Lee  washed  down  a  small  piece  of  opium  with  black coffee.</p>

<p>Horace  walked  in  and  gave  Lee  his  brief,  cold  nod.  Lee  rushed  over  and  embraced  him.  "This thing is bigger than both of us, Horace," he said. "Why hide our love?"</p>

<p>Horace thrust out his arms rigidly. "Knock it off," he said. "Knock it off."</p>

<p>"Just a Mexican abrazo, Horace. Custom of the country. Everyone does it down here."</p>

<p>"I don't care what the custom is. Just keep away from me."</p>

<p>"Horace! Why are you so cold?"</p>

<p>Horace said, "Knock it off, will you?" and walked out. A little later he came back and stood at the end of the bar drinking a beer.</p>

<p>Weston and Al and Richard came over and stood with Lee. "We're with you, Bill," Weston said. "If he lays a finger on you I'll break a beer bottle over his head."</p>

<p>Lee did not want to push the routine past a joking stage. He said, "Oh, Horace is okay, I guess.</p>

<p>But there's a limit to what I can stand still for. Two years he hands me these curt nods. Two years he walks  into Lola's  and looks around—'Nothing  in here  but fags,'  he says and  goes  out on the street to drink his beer. Like I say, there is a limit."</p>

<p>Allerton came back from his trip to Morelia sullen and irritable. When Lee asked if he had a good trip, he muttered,  "Oh, all  right,"  and  went in  the other  room  to play chess  with  Mary.  Lee felt  a charge of anger pass through his body. "I'll make him pay for this somehow," he thought.</p>

<p>Lee  considered  buying  a  half-interest  in  the  Ship  Ahoy.  Allerton  existed  on  credit  at  the  Ship Ahoy, and owed four hundred pesos. If Lee was half-owner of the joint, Allerton would not be in a position to ignore him. Lee did not actually want retaliation. He felt a desperate need to maintain some special contact with Allerton.</p>

<p>Lee managed to re-establish contact. One afternoon Lee and Allerton went to visit Al Hyman, who was in the hospital with jaundice. On the way home they stopped in the Bottoms Up for a cocktail.</p>

<p>"What about this trip to South America?" Lee said abruptly.</p>

<p>"Well, it's always nice to see places you haven't seen before," said Allerton.</p>

<p>"Can you leave anytime?"</p>

<p>"Anytime."</p>

<p>Next  day  Lee  started  collecting  the  necessary  visas  and  tickets.  "Better  buy  some  camping equipment here," he said. "We may have to trek back into the jungle to find the Yage. When we get where the Yage is, we'll dig a hip cat and ask him, 'Where can we score for Yage?'"</p>

<p>"How  will you know where  to look for  the Yage?" "I aim to find that out in Bogotá.  A Colombian scientist who lives in Bogotá isolated Telepathine from Yage. We must find that scientist."</p>

<p>"Suppose he won't talk?"</p>

<p>"They all talk when Boris goes to work on them."</p>

<p>"You Boris?"</p>

<p>"Certainly  not.  We  pick  up  Boris  in  Panama.  He  did  excellent  work  with  the  Reds  in  Barcelona and  with  the  Gestapo  in  Poland.  A  talented  man.  All  his  work  has  the  Boris  touch.  Light,  but persuasive.  A  mild  little  fellow  with  spectacles.  Looks  like  a  bookkeeper.  I  met  him  in  a  Turkish bath in Budapest."</p>

<p>A blond Mexican boy went by pushing a cart. "Jesus Christ!" Lee said, his mouth dropping open.</p>

<p>"One  of  them  blond-headed  Mexicans!  'Tain't  as  if  it  was  being  queer,  Allerton.  After  all,  they's only Mexicans. Let's have a drink."</p>

<p>They  left  by  bus  a  few  days  later,  and  by  the  time  they  reached  Panama  City,  Allerton  was already complaining that Lee was too demanding in his desires. Otherwise, they got on very well.</p>

<p>Now that Lee could spend days and nights with the object of his attentions, he felt relieved of the gnawing emptiness and fear. And Allerton was a good travelling companion, sensible and calm.</p>

<p><strong>Chapter 7</strong></p>

<p>They  flew  from  Panama  to  Quito,  in  a  tiny  plane  which  had  to  struggle  to  climb  above  an overcast. The  steward plugged in the oxygen. Lee sniffed the oxygen hose.  "It's  cut!" he said in disgust.</p>

<p>They drove into Quito in a windy, cold twilight. The  hotel looked a hundred  years old. The room had a high ceiling with black beams and white piaster walls. They sat on the beds, shivering. Lee was a little junk sick.</p>

<p>They walked around the main square. Lee hit a drugstore—no paregoric  without a script. A cold wind  from  the  high  mountains  blew  rubbish  through  the  dirty  streets.  The  people  walked  by  in gloomy  silence.  Many  had  blankets  wrapped  around  their  faces.  A  row  of  hideous  old  hags, huddled  in  dirty  blankets  that  looked  like  old  burlap  sacks,  were  ranged  along  the  walls  of  a church.</p>

<p>"Now, son, I want you to know I am different from other citizens you might run into. Some people will give you the women-are-no-good routine. I'm not like that. You just pick yourself one of these señoritas and take her right hack to the hotel with you."</p>

<p>Allerton looked at him. "I think I will get laid tonight," he said.</p>

<p>"Sure," Lee said. "Go right ahead. They don't have much pulchritude in this dump, but that hadn't oughta deter you young fellers. Was it Frank Harris said he never saw an ugly woman till he was thirty? It was, as a matter of fact. . . . Let's go back to the hotel and have a drink."</p>

<p>The bar was drafty. Oak chairs with black leather seats. They ordered martinis. At the next table a red-faced American in an expensive brown gabardine suit was talking about some deal involving twenty thousand acres. Across from Lee was an Ecuadoran man, with a long nose and a spot of red  on  each  cheekbone,  dressed  in  a  black  suit  of  European  cut.  He  was  drinking  coffee  and eating sweet cakes.</p>

<p>Lee  drank  several  cocktails.  He  was  getting  sicker  by  the  minute.  "Why don't  you  smoke  some weed?" Allerton suggested. 'That might help."</p>

<p>"Good idea. Let's go up to the room."</p>

<p>Lee smoked a stick of tea on the balcony. "My god, is it cold out on that balcony," he said, coming back into the room.</p>

<p>"'. . . And when twilight falls on the beautiful old colonial city of Quito and those cool breezes steal down from the Andes, walk out in the fresh  of the evening  and look over the beautiful señoritas who  seat  themselves,  in  colorful  native  costume,  along  the  wall  of  the  sixteenth-century  church that  overlooks  the  main  square.  .  .  .'  They  fired  the  guy  wrote  that.  There  are  limits,  even  in  a travel folder. . . .</p>

<p>"Tibet must be about like this. High and cold and full of ugly-looking people and llamas and yaks.</p>

<p>Yak  milk  for  breakfast,  yak  curds  for  lunch, and for  dinner a  yak  boiled in his  own butter, and  a fitting punishment for a yak, too, if you ask me.</p>

<p>"You can smell one of those holy men ten miles downwind on a clear day. Sitting there pulling on his old prayer wheel so nasty. Wrapped in dirty old burlap sacks, with bedbugs  crawling around where  his  neck  sticks  out  of  the  sack.  His  nose  is  all  rotted  away  and  he  spits  betel  nut  out through the nose holes like a spitting cobra. . . . Give me that Wisdom-of-the-East routine.</p>

<p>"So we got like a holy man and some bitch reporter comes to interview him. He sits there chewing on his betel nut. After a while, he says to one of his acolytes, 'Go down to the Sacred Well and bring  me  a  dipper  of  paregoric.  I'm  going  to  make  with  the Wisdom  of  the  East.  And  shake  the lead out of your loin cloth!' So he drinks the P.G. and goes into a light trance, and makes cosmic contact—we  call  it  going  on  the  nod  in  the  trade.  The  reporter  says,  'Will  there  be  war  with Russia, Mahatma? Will Communism destroy the civilized world? Is the soul immortal? Does God exist?'</p>

<p>"The Mahatma opens his eyes and compresses his lips and spits two long, red streams of betel nut juice  out  through  his  nose  holes.  It  runs  down  over  his  mouth  and  he  licks  it back  in  with  a long, coated tongue and says, 'How in the fuck should I know?' The acolyte says, 'You heard the man. Now cut. The Swami wants to be alone with his medications.' Come to think of it, that is the wisdom of the East. The Westerner thinks there is some secret he can discover. The East says,</p>

<p>'How the fuck should I know?'"</p>

<p>That night Lee dreamed he was in a penal colony. All around were high, bare mountains. He lived in a boardinghouse that was never warm. He went out for a walk. As he stepped off a streetcomer onto a dirty cobblestone street, the cold mountain wind hit him. He tightened the belt of his leather jacket and felt the chill of final despair.</p>

<p>Lee woke up and called to Allerton, "Are you awake, Gene?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Cold?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Can I come over with you?"</p>

<p>"Ahh, well all right."</p>

<p>Lee got in bed with Allerton. He was shaking with cold and junk sickness.</p>

<p>"You're  twitching  all  over,"  said  Allerton.  Lee  pressed  against  him,  convulsed  by  the  adolescent lust of junk sickness.</p>

<p>"Christ almighty, your hands are cold."</p>

<p>When Allerton was asleep, he rolled over and threw his knee across Lee's body. Lee lay still so he wouldn't wake up and move away.</p>

<p>The next day Lee was really sick. They wandered around Quito. The more Lee saw of Quito, the more the place brought him down. The town was hilly, the streets narrow. Allerton stepped off the high curb and a car grazed him. "Thank god you're not hurt,"</p>

<p>Lee said. "I sure would hate to be stuck in this town."</p>

<p>They sat down in a little coffeehouse where some German refugees hung out, talking about visas and extensions and work permits, and got into a conversation with a man at the next table. The man was thin and blond, his head caved in at the temples. Lee could see the blue veins pulsing in the cold, high-mountain sunlight that covered the man's weak, ravaged face and spilled over the scarred oak table onto the worn wooden floor. Lee asked the man if he liked Quito.</p>

<p>"To be or not to be, that is the question. I have to like it."</p>

<p>They walked out of the coffeehouse, and up the street to a park. The trees were stunted by wind and cold. A few boys were rowing around and around in a small pond. Lee watched them, torn by lust and curiosity. He saw himself desperately rummaging through bodies and rooms and closets in  a  frenzied  search,  a  recurrent  nightmare.  At  the  end  of  the  search  was  an  empty  room.  He shivered in the cold wind.</p>

<p>Allerton said, "Why don't you ask in the coffee shop for the name of a doctor?"</p>

<p>"That's a good idea."</p>

<p>The doctor lived in a yellow stucco villa on a quiet side street. He was Jewish, with a smooth, red face,  and  spoke  good  English.  Lee  put  down  a  dysentery  routine.  The  doctor  asked  a  few questions.  He  started  to  write  out  a  prescription.  Lee  said,  "The  prescription  that  works  best  is paregoric with bismuth."</p><empty-line /><p>The  doctor  laughed.  He  gave  Lee  a  long  look.  Finally  he said,  "Tell  the truth  now."  He  raised  a forefinger, smiling. "Are you addicted to opiates? Better you tell me. Otherwise I cannot help you."</p>

<p>Lee said, "Yes."</p>

<p>"Ah ha," said the doctor, and he crumpled up the prescription he was writing and dropped it in the wastebasket.  He  asked  Lee  how  long  the  addiction  had  lasted.  He  shook  his  head,  looking  at Lee.</p>

<p>"Ach,"  he said,  "you are  a  young  person.  You must stop this  habit.  So  you lose  your life.  Better you should suffer now than continue this habit." The doctor gave Lee a long, human look.</p>

<p>"My god," Lee thought, "what you have to put up with in this business." He nodded and said, "Of course,  Doctor,  and  I  want  to  stop.  But  I  have  to  get  some  sleep.  I  am  going  to  the  coast tomorrow, to Manta."</p>

<p>The  doctor  sat  back  in his  chair,  smiling. "You  must  stop this  habit." He  ran  through  the  routine again. Lee nodded abstractedly. Finally the doctor reached for his prescription pad: three c.c.'s of tincture.</p>

<p>The  drugstore  gave  Lee  paregoric  instead  of  tincture.  Three  c.c.'s  of  P.G.  Less  than  a teaspoonful.  Nothing.  Lee  bought  a  bottle  of  antihistamine  tablets  and  took  a  handful.  They seemed to help a little.</p>

<p>Lee and Allerton took a plane the next day for Manta.</p>

<p>The  Hotel  Continental  in  Manta  was  made  of  split  bamboo  and  rough  boards.  Lee  found  some knotholes  in the  wall of  their  room,  and plugged the  holes  up  with paper.  "We  don't  want to  get deported under a cloud," he said to Allerton. "I'm a little junk sick, you know, and that makes me sooo sexy. The neighbors could witness some innaresting sights."</p>

<p>"I  wish  to  register  a  complaint  concerning  breach  of  contract,"  said  Allerton.  "You  said  twice  a week."</p>

<p>"So  I  did.  Well,  of  course  the  contract  is  more  or  less  elastic  you  might  say.  But  you  are  right.</p>

<p>Twice  a  week  it  is,  sire.  Of  course,  if  you  get  hot  pants  between  times,  don't  hesitate  to  let  me know."</p>

<p>"I'll give you a buzz."</p>

<p>The  water was just  right for  Lee, who could not stand cold water. There  was no shock  when he plunged in. They swam for an hour or so, then sat on the beach looking at the sea. Allerton could sit for hours doing absolutely nothing. He said, "That boat out there has been warming up for the past hour."</p>

<p>"I am going into town to dig the local bodegas and buy a bottle of cognac," Lee told him.</p>

<p>The  town  looked  old,  with  limestone  streets  and  dirty  saloons  crowded  with  sailors  and dockworkers.  A  shoeshine  boy  asked  Lee  if  he  wanted  a  "nice  girl."  Lee  looked  at  the  boy  and said in English, "No, and I don't want you either."</p>

<p>He  bought  a  bottle  of  cognac  from  a  Turkish  trader.  The  store  had  everything:  ship  stores, hardware, guns, food, liquor. Lee priced the guns: three hundred dollars for a 30-30 lever-action Winchester carbine that sold for seventy-two dollars in the States. The Turk said duty was high on guns. That was the reason for this price.</p>

<p>Lee  walked  back  along  the  beach.  The  houses  were  all  split  bamboo  on  wood  frame,  the  four posts set directly in the ground. The simplest type of house construction: you set four heavy posts deep in the ground and nail the house to the posts. The houses  were built about six feet off the ground. The streets were mud. Thousands of vultures roosted on the houses and walked around the streets, pecking at offal. Lee kicked at a vulture, and the bird flapped away with an indignant squawk.</p>

<p>Lee passed  a bar,  a  large building  built directly  on the ground, and decided  to  go in for  a drink.</p><empty-line /><p>The split-bamboo walls shook with noise. Two middle-aged wiry little men were doing an obscene mambo routine opposite each other, their leathery faces creased in toothless smiles. The waiter came up and smiled at Lee. He didn't have any front teeth either. Lee sat down on a short wood bench and ordered a cognac. A boy of sixteen or so came over and sat down with Lee and smiled an open, friendly smile. Lee smiled back and ordered a refresco for the boy. He dropped a hand on Lee's  thigh and squeezed it in thanks for  the drink.  The  boy had uneven teeth,  crowded  one over  the  other,  but  he  was  a  young boy. Lee  looked  at him  speculatively;  he  couldn't  figure  the score. Was the boy giving  him  a  come-on,  or  wars he just  friendly? He  knew  that  people  in the Latin  American  countries  were  not  self-conscious  about  physical  contact.  Boys  walked  around with  their  arms  around  each  other's  necks.  Lee  decided  to  play  it  cool.  He  finished  his  drink, shook hands with the boy, and walked back to the hotel.</p>

<p>Allerton  was  still  sitting  on  the  porch  in  his  swimming  trunks  and  a  short-sleeved  yellow  shirt, which  flapped  around  his  thin  body  in  the  evening  wind.  Lee  went  inside  to  the  kitchen  and ordered ice and water and glasses. He told Allerton about the Turk, the town and the boy. "Let's go dig that bar after dinner," he said.</p>

<p>"And get felt up by those young boys?" said Allerton. "I should say not."</p>

<p>Lee laughed. He was feeling surprisingly well. The antihistamine cut his junk sickness to a vague malaise, something he would not have noticed if he did not know what it was. He looked out over the bay, red in the setting sun. Boats of all sizes were anchored in the bay. Lee wanted to buy a boat and sail up and down the coast. Allerton liked the idea.</p>

<p>"While we are  in Ecuador  we must score for  Yage," Lee said. "Think  of it: thought control.  Take anyone  apart  and  rebuild  to  your  taste.  Anything  about  somebody  bugs  you,  you  say,  'Yage!  I want that routine took clear out of his mind.' I could think of a few changes I might make in you, doll."  He  looked  at  Allerton  and  licked  his  lips.  "You'd  be  so  much  nicer  after  a  few  alterations.</p>

<p>You're nice now, of course,  but you do have those  irritating  little peculiarities. I mean, you won't do exactly what I want you to do all the time."</p>

<p>"Do you think there is anything in it, really?" Allerton asked.</p>

<p>"The  Russians  seem  to think  so.  I  understand  Yage  is  the most  efficient confession  drug.  They have also used peyote. Ever try it?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Horrible  stuff.  Made  me  sick  like  I  wanted  to  die.  I  got  to  puke  and  I  can't.  Just  excruciating spasms  of  the  asparagras,  or  whatever  you  call  that  gadget.  Finally  the  peyote  conies  up  solid like a ball of hair, solid all the  way up, clogging  my throat. As nasty a sensation as I ever stood still for. The high is interesting, but hardly worth the sick stage. Your face swells around the eyes, and  the  lips  swell,  and  you  look  and  feel  like  an  Indian,  or  what  you  figure  an  Indian  feels  like.</p>

<p>Primitive,  you  understand.  Colors  are  more  intense,  but  somehow  flat  and  two-dimensional.</p>

<p>Everything looks like a peyote plant. There is a nightmare undercurrent.</p>

<p>"I had nightmares after using it, one after the other, every time I went back to sleep. In one dream I had rabies and looked in the mirror and my face changed and I began howling. Another dream I had a chlorophyll habit. Me and five other chlorophyll addicts are waiting to score. We turn green and  we  can't  kick  the chlorophyll  habit.  One  shot  and  you are  hung  for  life. We are  turning  into plants. You know anything about psychiatry? Schizophrenia?"</p>

<p>"Not much."</p>

<p>"In  some  cases  of  schizophrenia  a  phenomenon  occurs  known  as  automatic  obedience.  I  say,</p>

<p>'Stick  out  your  tongue,'  and  you  can't  keep  yourself  from  obeying.  Whatever  I  say,  whatever anyone says,  you must do. Get the picture? A pretty picture, isn't  it, so long as you are the one giving  the  orders  that  are  automatically  obeyed.  Automatic  obedience,  synthetic  schizophrenia, mass-produced  to  order.  That  is  the  Russian  dream,  and  America  is  not  far  behind.  The bureaucrats  of  both  countries  want  the  same  thing:  Control.  The  superego,  the  controlling agency, gone cancerous and berserk. Incidentally, there  is a connection between schizophrenia and telepathy. Schizos are very telepathically sensitive, but are strictly receivers. Dig the tie-in?"</p>

<p>"But you wouldn't know Yage if you saw it?"</p>

<p>Lee  thought  a  minute.  "Much  as  I  dislike  the  idea,  I  will  have  to  go  back  to  Quito  and  talk  to  a botanist at the Botanical Institute there."</p>

<p>"I'm not going back to Quito for anything," said Allerton.</p>

<p>"I'm not going right away. I need some rest and I want to kick the Chinaman all the way out. No need for you to go. You stay on the beach. Papa will go and get the info."</p>

<p><strong>Chapter 8</strong></p>

<p>From Manta they flew on to Guayaquil. The road  was flooded, so the only way to get there  was by plane or boat.</p>

<p>Guayaquil  is built  along  a river,  a city with many parks  and squares  and statues. The  parks are full of tropical trees  and shrubs and vines.  A tree  that  fans  out like  an umbrella, as wide as it is tall, shades the stone benches. The people do a great deal of sitting.</p>

<p>One  day  Lee  got  up  early  and  went  to  the  market.  The  place  was  crowded.  A  curiously  mixed populace: Negro, Chinese, Indian, European, Arab, characters difficult to classify. Lee saw some beautiful boys of mixed Chinese and Negro stock, slender and graceful with beautiful white teeth.</p>

<p>A hunchback with withered legs was playing crude bamboo panpipes, a mournful Oriental music with the sadness of the high mountains. In deep sadness there is no place for sentimentality. It is as final as the mountains: a fact. There it is. When you realize it, you cannot complain.</p>

<p>People  crowded  around  the  musician,  listened  a  few  minutes,  and  walked  on.  Lee  noticed  a young man with the skin tight over his small face, looking exactly like a shrunken head. He could not have weighed more than ninety pounds.</p>

<p>The  musician  coughed  from  time  to  time.  Once  he  snarled  when  someone  touched  his  hump, showing  his  black  rotten  teeth.  Lee  gave  the  man  a  few  coins.  He  walked  on,  looking  at  every face he passed, looking into doorways and up at the windows of cheap hotels. An iron bedstead painted  light  pink,  a  shirt  out  to  dry  .  .  .  scraps  of  life.  Lee  snapped  at  them  hungrily,  like  a predatory fish cut off from his prey by a glass wall. He could not stop ramming his nose against the glass in the nightmare search of his dream. And at the end he was standing in a dusty room in the late afternoon sun, with an old shoe in his hand.</p>

<p>The city, like all Ecuador, produced a curiously baffling impression. Lee felt there was something going  on  here,  some  undercurrent  of  life  that  was  hidden  from  him.  This  was  the  area  of  the ancient  Chimu  pottery,  where  salt  shakers  and  water  pitchers  were  nameless  obscenities:  two men on all fours engaged in sodomy formed the handle for the top of a kitchen pot.</p>

<p>What happens when there is no limit? What is the fate of The Land Where Anything Goes? Men changing into huge centipedes . . . centipedes besieging the houses ... a man tied to a couch and a  centipede  ten  feet  long  rearing  up  over  him.  Is  this  literal?  Did  some  hideous  metamorphosis occur? What is the meaning of the centipede symbol?</p>

<p>Lee got on a  bus and rode to the end of the line. He  took  another bus. He  rode  out to the river and  drank  a  soda,  and  watched  some  boys  swimming  in  the  dirty  river.  The  river  looked  as  if nameless monsters might rise from the green-brown water. Lee saw a lizard two feet long run up the opposite bank.</p>

<p>He walked back towards town. He passed a group of boys on a corner. One of the boys was so beautiful  that  the  image  cut  Lee's  senses  like  a  wire  whip.  A  slight  involuntary  sound  of  pain escaped  from  Lee's  lips. He  turned around,  as  though  looking  at the  street  name.  The  boy  was laughing at some joke, a high-pitched laugh, happy and gay. Lee walked on.</p>

<p>Six or seven boys, aged twelve to fourteen, were playing in a heap of rubbish on the waterfront.</p><empty-line /><p>One of the boys was urinating against a post and smiling at the other boys. The boys noticed Lee.</p>

<p>Now  their  play  was  overtly  sexual,  with  an  undercurrent  of  mockery.  They  looked  at  Lee  and whispered and laughed. Lee looked at them openly, a cold, hard stare of naked lust. He felt the tearing ache of limitless desire.</p>

<p>He focused on one boy, the image sharp and clear, as if seen through a telescope with the other boys and the  waterfront  blacked out. The  boy vibrated  with life  like a  young animal. A wide grin showed sharp, white teeth. Under the torn shirt Lee glimpsed the thin body.</p>

<p>He could feel himself in the body of the boy. Fragmentary memories . . . the smell of cocoa beans drying in the sun, bamboo tenements, the warm dirty river, the swamps and rubbish heaps on the outskirts of the town. He was with the other boys, sitting on the stone floor of a deserted house.</p>

<p>The roof was gone. The stone walls were falling down. Weeds and vines grew over the walls and stretched across the floor.</p>

<p>The boys were taking down their torn pants. Lee lifted his thin buttocks to slip down his pants. He could feel the stone floor. He had his pants down to his ankles. His knees were clasped together, and the other boys were trying to pull them apart. He gave in, and they held his knees open. He looked at them and smiled, and slipped his hand down over his stomach. Another boy who was standing  up  dropped  his  pants  and  stood  there  with  his  hands  on  his  hips,  looking  down  at  his erect organ.</p>

<p>A boy sat down by Lee and reached  over between  his  legs. Lee felt the orgasm  blackout  in the hot sun.  He  stretched  out  and threw  his  arm  over his  eyes. Another  boy rested  his  head  on his stomach.  Lee  could  feel  the  warmth  of  the  other's  head,  itching  a  little  where  the  hair  touched Lee's stomach.</p>

<p>Now he was in a bamboo tenement. An oil lamp lit a woman's body. Lee could feel desire for the woman through the other's body. "I'm not queer," he thought. "I'm disembodied."</p>

<p>Lee walked on, thinking, "What can I do? Take them back to my hotel? They are willing enough.</p>

<p>For a few Sucres. ..." He felt a killing hate for the stupid, ordinary, disapproving people who kept him  from doing what he wanted to do. "Someday I  am going to have  things  just  like  I  want," he said to himself. "And if any moralizing son of a bitch gives me any static, they will fish him out of the river."</p>

<p>Lee's  plan  involved  a  river.  He  lived  on  the  river  and  ran  things  to  please  himself.  He  grew  his own weed and poppies and cocaine,  and he had a  young native boy for an all-purpose servant.</p>

<p>Boats were moored in the dirty river. Great masses of water hyacinths floated by. The river was a good half-mile across.</p>

<p>Lee walked up to a little park. There was a statue of Bolivar, "The Liberating Fool" as Lee called him,  shaking  hands  with  someone  else.  Both  of  them  looked  tired  and  disgusted  and  rocking queer,  so  queer  it  rocked  you.  Lee  stood  looking  at  the  statue.  Then  he  sat  down  on  a  stone bench facing the river. Everyone looked at Lee when he sat down. Lee looked back. He did not have  the  American  reluctance  to  meet  the  gaze  of  a  stranger.  The  others  looked  away,  and  lit cigarettes and resumed their conversations.</p>

<p>Lee  sat  there  looking  at  the  dirty  yellow  river.  He  couldn't  see  half  an  inch  under  the  surface.</p>

<p>From  time  to time,  small fish  jumped  ahead  of  a  boat.  There  were trim,  expensive  sailing  boats from  the  yacht  club,  with  hollow  masts  and  beautiful  lines.  There  were  dugout  canoes  with outboard motors and cabins of split bamboo. Two old rusty battleships were moored in the middle of the river—the  Ecuadoran Navy. Lee sat there a full hour, then got up and walked back to the hotel.  It  was  three  o'clock.  Allerton  was  still  in  bed.  Lee  sat  down  on  the  edge  of  the  bed.  "It's three o'clock, Gene. Time to get up."</p>

<p>"What for?"</p>

<p>"You want to spend your life in bed? Come on out and dig the town with me. I saw some beautiful boys on the  waterfront.  The  real uncut  boy stuff.  Such teeth, such smiles. Young boys  vibrating with life."</p><empty-line /><p>"All right. Stop drooling."</p>

<p>"What have they got that I want, Gene? Do you know?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"They  have  maleness,  of  course.  So  have  I.  I  want  myself  the  same  way  I  want  others.  I'm disembodied.  I  can't  use  my  own  body  for  some  reason."  He  put  out  his  hand.  Allerton  dodged away.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?"</p>

<p>"I thought you were going to run your hand down my ribs."</p>

<p>"I wouldn't do that. Think I'm queer or something?"</p>

<p>"Frankly, yes."</p>

<p>"You  do  have  nice  ribs.  Show  me  the  broken  one.  Is  that  it  there?"  Lee  ran  his  hand  halfway down Allerton's ribs. "Or is it further down?"</p>

<p>"Oh, go away."</p>

<p>"But, Gene ... I am due, you know."</p>

<p>"Yes, I suppose you are."</p>

<p>"Of  course,  if  you'd rather  wait until tonight. These  tropical nights  are so  romantic. That  way we could  take  twelve  hours  or  so  and  do  the  thing  right."  Lee  ran  his  hands  down  over  Allerton's stomach. He could see that Allerton was a little excited.</p>

<p>Allerton said, "Maybe it would be better now. You know I like to sleep alone."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know. Too bad. If I had my way we'd sleep every night all wrapped around each other like hibernating rattlesnakes."</p>

<p>Lee  was  taking off  his  clothes.  He  lay  down  beside  Allerton.  "Wouldn't it  be  booful if  we  should juth run together into one gweat big blob," he said in baby talk. "Am I giving you the horrors?"</p>

<p>"Indeed you are."</p>

<p>Allerton surprised Lee by an unusual intensity of response. At the climax he squeezed Lee hard around the ribs. He sighed deeply and closed his eyes.</p>

<p>Lee smoothed his eyebrows with his thumbs. "Do you mind that?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Not terribly."</p>

<p>"But you do enjoy it sometimes? The whole deal, I mean."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes."</p>

<p>Lee lay on his back with one cheek against Allerton's shoulder, and went to sleep.</p>

<p>Lee  decided  to  apply for  a  passport  before  leaving  Guayaquil.  He  was changing  clothes  to  visit the embassy, and talking to Allerton. "Wouldn't do to wear high shoes. The Consul is probably an elegant pansy. . . . 'My dear, can you believe it? High shoes. I mean real old button-hooky shoes.</p>

<p>I simply couldn't take my eyes off those shoes. I'm afraid I have no idea what he wanted.'</p>

<p>"I hear they are purging the State Department of queers. If they do, they will be operating with a skeleton staff , . . ah, here they are."Lee was putting on a pair of low shoes. "Imagine walking in on the Consul and asking him right out for money to eat on. ... He rears back and claps a scented handkerchief  over  his  mouth,  as  if  you  had  dropped  a  dead  lobster  on  his  desk:  'You're  broke!</p>

<p>Really,  I  don't  know  why  you  come  to  me  with  this  revolting  disclosure.  You  might  show  a modicum  of  consideration.  You  must  realize  how  distasteful  this  sort  of  thing  is.  Have  you  no pride?'"</p>

<p>Lee turned to Allerton. "How do I look? Don't want to look too good, or he will be trying to get in my pants. Maybe you'd better go. That way we'll get our passports by tomorrow."</p>

<p>Listen to this." Lee was reading from a</p>

<p>Guayaquil  paper.  "It  seems  that  the  Peruvian  delegates  at  the  anti-tuberculosis  congress  in Salinas appeared at the meeting carrying huge maps on which were shown the parts of Ecuador appropriated  by  Peru  in  the  1939  war.  The  Ecuadoran  doctors  might  go  to  the  meeting  twirling shrunken heads of Peruvian soldiers on their watch chains."</p>

<p>Allerton had found an article about the heroic fight put up by Ecuador's wolves of the sea.</p>

<p>"Their what?"</p>

<p>"That's  what it says: Lobos del Mar. It seems that one officer stuck by his gun, even though  the mechanism was no longer operating."</p>

<p>"Sounds simpleminded to me."</p>

<p>They decided to look for a boat in Las Playas. Las Playas was cold and the water was rough and muddy,  a  dreary  middle-class  resort.  The  food  was  terrible,  but  the  room  without  meals  was almost  the  same  as  full  pensión.  They  tried  one  lunch.  A  plate  of  rice  without  sauce,  without anything. Allerton said, "I am hurt." A tasteless soup with some fibrous material floating in it that looked like soft, white wood. The main course was a nameless meat as impossible to identify as to eat.</p>

<p>Lee said, "The cook has barricaded himself in the kitchen. He is shoving this slop out through a slot." The food was, as a matter of fact, passed out through a slot in a door from a dark, smoky room where, presumably, it was being prepared.</p>

<p>They decided they would go on to Salinas the next day. That night Lee wanted to go to bed with Allerton, but he refused and the next morning Lee said he was sorry he asked so soon after the last time, which was a breach of contract.</p>

<p>Allerton said, "I don't like people who apologize at breakfast."</p>

<p>Lee said, "Really, Gene, aren't you taking an unfair advantage? Like someone was junk sick and I don't use junk. I say, 'Sick, really? I don't know why you tell me about your disgusting condition.</p>

<p>You might at least have the decency to keep it to yourself if you are sick. I hate sick people. You must realize how distasteful it is to see you sneezing and yawning and retching. Why don't you go someplace  where  I  won't  have  to  look  at  you?  You've  no  idea  how  tiresome  you  are,  or  how disgusting. Have you no pride?'"</p>

<p>Allerton said, 'That isn't fair at all."</p>

<p>"It  isn't  supposed  to  be  fair.  Just  a  routine  for  your  amusement,  containing  a  modicum  of  truth.</p>

<p>Hurry and finish your breakfast. We'll miss the Salinas bus."</p>

<p>Salinas  had  the  quiet,  dignified  air  of  an  upper-class  resort  town.  They  had  come  in  the  off season.  When  they  went  to  swim  they  found  out  why  this  was  not  the  season:  the  Humboldt current  makes  the  water  cold  during  the  summer months.  Allerton  put  his  foot  in  the  water  and said, "It's nothing but cold," and refused to go in. Lee plunged in and swam for a few minutes.</p>

<p>Time  seemed  to speed  up  in  Salinas.  Lee  would  eat  lunch  and  lie  on  the  beach.  After  a  period that seemed like an hour, or at most two hours, he saw the sun low in the sky: six o'clock. Allerton reported the same experience.</p>

<p>Lee went to Quito to get information on the  Yage. Allerton stayed in Salinas. Lee  was back  five days later.</p>

<p>"Yage  is  also  known  to  the  Indians  as  Ayahuasca.  Scientific  name  is  Bannisteria  caapi,"  Lee spread a map out on the bed. "It grows in high jungle on the Amazon side of the Andes. We will go on to Puyo. That is the end of the road. We should be able to locate someone there who can deal with the Indians, and get the Yage."</p><empty-line /><p>They  spent  a  night  in  Guayaquil.  Lee  got  drunk  before  dinner  and  slept  through  a  movie. They went  back  to  the  hotel  to  go  to  bed  and  get  an  early  start  in  the  morning.  Lee  poured  himself some  brandy  and  sat  down  on  the  edge  of  Allerton's  bed.  "You  look  sweet  tonight,"  he  said, taking off his glasses. How about a little kiss? Huh?"</p>

<p>"Oh, go away," said Allerton.</p>

<p>"Okay kid, if you say so. There's plenty of time," Lee poured some more brandy in his glass and lay down on his own bed.</p>

<p>"You know, Gene, not only have they got poor people in this jerkwater country. They also got like rich people. I saw some on the train going up to Quito. I expect they keep  a plane  revved  up in the back yard. I can see them loading television sets and radios and golf clubs and tennis rackets and  shotguns  into  the  plane,  and  then  trying to  boot  a  prize  Brahma  bull  in  on  top  of  the  other junk, so the windup is the plane won't get off the ground.</p>

<p>"It's a small, unstable, undeveloped country. Economic setup exactly the way I figured  it: all raw materials,  lumber,  food,  labor,  rent,  very  cheap.  All  manufactured  goods  very  high,  because  of import duty. The duty is supposed to protect Ecuadoran industry. There is no Ecuadoran industry.</p>

<p>No  production  here.  The  people  who  can  produce  won't  produce,  because  they  don't  want  any money  tied  up  here.  They  want  to  be  ready  to  pull  out  right  now,  with  a  bundle  of  cold  cash, preferably  U.S.  dollars.  They  are  unduly  alarmed.  Rich  people  are  generally  frightened.  I  don't know  why.  Something  to  do  with  a  guilt  complex,  I  imagine.  ¿Quién  sabe?  I  have  not  come  to psychoanalyze Caesar, but to protect his person. At a price, of course. What they need here is a security department, to keep the underdog under."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Allerton. "We must secure uniformity of opinion."</p>

<p>"Opinion! What are we running here, a debating society? Give me one year and the people won't have any opinions. 'Now just fall in line here folks, for your nice tasty stew of fish heads and rice and oleomargarine. And over here for your ration of free lush laced with opium.' So if they get out of line, we jerk the junk out of the lush and they're all lying around shitting in their pants, too weak to move. An eating habit is the worst habit you can have. Another angle is malaria. A debilitating affliction, tailor-made to water down the revolutionary spirit."</p>

<p>Lee smiled. "Just imagine some old humanist German doctor. I say, 'Well, Doc, you done a great job here with malaria. Cut the incidence down almost to nothing.'</p>

<p>"'Ach, yes. We do our best, is it not? You see this line in the graph? The line shows the decline in this sickness in the past ten years since we commence with our treatment program.'</p>

<p>"'Yeah, Doc. Now look, I want to see that line go back where it came from.'</p>

<p>"'Ach, this you cannot mean.'</p>

<p>"'And another thing. See if you can't import an especially debilitating strain of hookworm.'</p>

<p>"The mountain people we can always immobilize by taking their blankets away, leaving them with the enterprise of a frozen lizard."</p>

<p>The inside wall to Lee's room stopped about three feet from the ceiling to allow for ventilating the next  room,  which  was  an  inside  room  with  no  windows.  The  occupant  of  the  next  room  said something in Spanish to the effect Lee should be quiet.</p>

<p>"Ah, shut up," said Lee, leaping to his feet. "I'll nail a blanket over that slot! I'll cut off your fucking air! You only breathe with my permission. You're the occupant of an inside room, a room without windows. So remember your place and shut your poverty-stricken mouth!"</p>

<p>A stream of chingas and cabrones replied.</p>

<p>"Hombre," Lee asked, "¿En dónde está su cultura?"</p>

<p>"Let's hit the sack," said Allerton. "I'm tired."</p><empty-line /><p><strong>Chapter 9</strong></p>

<p>They  took  a  river  boat  to  Babahoya.  Swinging  in  hammocks,  sipping  brandy,  and  watching  the jungle slide by. Springs, moss, beautiful clear streams and trees up to two hundred feet high. Lee and  Allerton  were  silent  as  the  boat  powered  upriver,  penetrating  the  jungle  stillness  with  its lawnmower  whine.  From  Babahoya  they  took  a  bus  over  the  Andes  to  Ambato,  a  cold,  jolting fourteen-hour  ride.  They  stopped  for  a  snack  of  chick-peas  at  a  hut  at  the  top  of  the  mountain pass, far above the tree line. A few young native men in gray felt hats ate their chickpeas in sullen resignation. Several guinea pigs were squeaking and scurrying around on the dirt floor of the hut.</p>

<p>Their cries reminded Lee of the guinea pig he owned as a child in the Fairmont Hotel in St.</p>

<p>Louis, when the family was waiting to move into their new house on Price Road. He remembered the way the pig shrieked, and the stink of its cage.</p>

<p>They passed the snow-covered peak of Chimborazo, cold in the moonlight and the constant wind of  the  high  Andes.  The  view  from  the  high  mountain  pass  seemed  from  another,  larger  planet than Earth. Lee and Allerton huddled together under a blanket, drinking brandy, the smell of wood smoke in their nostrils. They were both wearing Army-surplus jackets, zipped up over sweatshirts to keep out the cold and wind. Allerton seemed insubstantial as a phantom; Lee could almost see through him, to the empty phantom bus outside.</p>

<p>From  Ambato  to  Puyo,  along  the  edge  of  a  gorge  a  thousand  feet  deep.  There  were  waterfalls and forests and streams running down over the roadway, as they descended into the lush green valley. Several times the bus stopped to remove large stones that had slid down onto the road.</p>

<p>Lee was talking on the bus to an old prospector named Morgan, who had been thirty years in the jungle. Lee asked him about Ayahuasca.</p>

<p>"Acts on them like opium," Morgan said. "All my Indians use it. Can't get any work out of them for three days when they get on Ayahuasca."</p>

<p>"I think there may be a market for it," Lee said.</p>

<p>Morgan said, "I can get any amount."</p>

<p>They  passed  the  prefabricated  bungalows  of  Shell  Mara.  The  Shell  Company  had  spent  two years and twenty million dollars, found no oil, and pulled out. They got into Puyo late at night, and found a room in a ramshackle hotel near the general store.</p>

<p>Lee and Allerton were too exhausted to speak, and they fell asleep at once.</p>

<p>Next day Old Man Morgan went around with Lee, trying to score for Ayahuasca. Allerton was still sleeping.  They hit a  wall  of evasion.  One  man said he  would bring some the following day.  Lee knew he would not bring any.</p>

<p>They went to a little saloon run by a mulatto woman. She pretended not to know what Ayahuasca was.  Lee  asked  if  Ayahuasca  was  illegal.  "No,"  said  Morgan,  "but  the  people  are  suspicious  of strangers."</p>

<p>They sat there drinking aguardiente mixed with hot water and sugar and cinnamon. Lee said his racket  was  shrunk-down  heads.  Morgan  figured  they  could  start  a  head-shrinking plant.  "Heads rolling off the assembly line," he said. "You can't buy those heads at any price. The government forbids it, you know. The blighters were killing people to sell the heads."</p>

<p>Morgan had  an inexhaustible fund of old  dirty jokes. He  was talking  about some local character from Canada.</p>

<p>"How did he get down here?" Lee asked.</p>

<p>Morgan chuckled. "How did we all get down here? Spot of trouble in our own country, right?"</p>

<p>Lee nodded, without saying anything.</p><empty-line /><p>Old Man Morgan went back to Shell Mara on the afternoon bus to collect some money owed him.</p>

<p>Lee  talked  to  a  Dutchman  named  Sawyer  who  was  farming  near  Puyo.  Sawyer  told  him  there was an American botanist living in the jungle, a few hours out of Puyo.</p>

<p>"He  is  trying  to  develop  some  medicine.  I  forget  the  name.  If  he  succeeds  in  concentrating  this medicine, he says he will make a fortune. Now he is having a hard time. He has nothing to eat out there."</p>

<p>Lee said, "I am interested in medicinal plants. I may pay him a visit."</p>

<p>"He will be glad to see you. But take along some flour or tea or something. They have nothing out there."</p>

<p>Later Lee said to Allerton, "A botanist! What a break. He is our man. We will go tomorrow."</p>

<p>"We can hardly pretend we just happened by," said Allerton. "How are you going to explain your visit?"</p>

<p>"I will think of something. Best tell him right out I want to score for Yage. I figure maybe there is a buck in it for both of us. According to what I hear, he is flat on his ass. We are lucky to hit him in that condition. If he was in the chips and drinking champagne out of galoshes in the whorehouses of  Puyo,  he  would  hardly  be  interested  to  sell  me  a  few  hundred  Sucres'  worth  of  Yage.  And, Gene, for the love of Christ, when we do overhaul this character, please don't say, 'Doctor Cotter, I presume.'"</p>

<p>The  hotel  room  in Puyo  was  damp  and  cold.  The  houses  across  the street  were  blurred  by the pouring rain, like a city under water. Lee was picking up articles off the bed and shoving them into a  rubberized  sack.  A  .32  automatic  pistol,  some  cartridges  wrapped  in  oiled  silk,  a  small  frying pan, tea and flour packed in cans and sealed with adhesive tape, two quarts of Puro.</p>

<p>Allerton  said,  "This  booze  is  the heaviest  item,  and the  bottle's  got  like  sharp  edges. Why don't we leave it here?"</p>

<p>"We'll have to loosen his tongue," Lee said. He picked up the sack and handed  Allerton a shiny new machete.</p>

<p>"Let's wait till the rain stops," said Allerton.</p>

<p>"Wait till the rain stops!" Lee collapsed on the bed with loud, simulated laughter. "Haw haw haw!</p>

<p>Wait till the rain stops! They got a saying down here, like I'll pay you what I owe you when it stops raining in Puyo.' Haw haw."</p>

<p>"We had two clear days when we first got here."</p>

<p>"I know. A latter-day miracle. There's a movement on foot to canonize the local padre. Vámonos, cabrón."</p>

<p>Lee slapped Allerton's shoulder and they walked out in the rain, slipping on the wet cobblestones of the main street.</p>

<p>The trail was corduroy. The wood of the trail was covered with a film of mud. They cut long canes to keep from slipping, but it was slow walking. High jungle with hardwood forest on both sides of the  trail,  and  very  little  undergrowth.  Everywhere  was  water,  springs  and  streams  and  rivers  of clear, cold water.</p>

<p>"Good trout water," Lee said.</p>

<p>They  stopped  at  several  houses  to  ask  where  Cotter's  place  was.  Everyone  said  they  were headed right. How far? Two, three hours. Maybe more. Word seemed to have gone ahead. One man they met on the trail shifted his machete to shake hands and said at once, "You are looking for Cotter? He is in his house now."</p>

<p>"How far?" Lee asked.</p>

<p>The man looked at Lee and Allerton. "It will take you about three hours more."</p><empty-line /><p>They walked on and on. It was late afternoon now. They flipped a coin to see who would ask at the next house. Allerton lost.</p>

<p>"He says three more hours," Allerton said.</p>

<p>"We been hearing that for the past six hours."</p>

<p>Allerton wanted to rest. Lee said, "No. If  you rest, your legs get stiff. It's the worst thing you can do."</p>

<p>"Who told you that?"</p>

<p>"Old Man Morgan."</p>

<p>"Well, Morgan or no, I am going to rest."</p>

<p>"Don't  make  it too  long.  It  will be  a  hell  of  a  note  if  we  get caught  short,  stumbling over  snakes and jaguars in the dark and falling into quebrajas— that's what they call these deep crevices cut by streams of water. Some of them are sixty feet deep and four feet  wide. Just room enough to fall in."</p>

<p>They stopped to rest in a deserted house. The walls were gone, but there was a roof that looked pretty sound. "We could stop here in a pinch," said Allerton, looking around.</p>

<p>"A definite pinch. No blankets."</p>

<p>It  was  dark  when  they  reached  Cotter's  place,  a  small  thatched  hut  in  a  clearing.  Cotter  was  a wiry little man in his middle fifties. Lee observed that the reception was a bit cool. Lee brought out the liquor, and they all had a drink. Cotter's wife, a large, strong-looking, red-haired woman, made some tea with cinnamon to cut the kerosene taste of the Puro. Lee got drunk on three drinks.</p>

<p>Cotter  was  asking  Lee  a  lot  of  questions.  "How  did  you  happen  to  come  here? Where  are  you from?  How  long  have  you  been  in  Ecuador?  Who  told  you  about  me?  Are  you  a  tourist  or travelling on business?"</p>

<p>Lee  was  drunk.  He  began  talking  in  junky  lingo,  explaining  that  he  was  looking  for  Yage,  or Ayahuasca.  He  understood  the Russians and  the Americans  were experimenting  with this  drug.</p>

<p>Lee said he figured there might be a buck in the deal for both of them. The more Lee talked, the cooler Cotter's manner became. The man was clearly suspicious, but why or of what, Lee could not decide.</p>

<p>Dinner was pretty good, considering the chief ingredient was a sort of fibrous root and bananas.</p>

<p>After dinner, Cotter's wife said, 'These boys must be tired, Jim."</p>

<p>Cotter  led the  way with a  flashlight  that developed power  by pressing  a lever.  A cot about  thirty inches  wide made of bamboo  slats.  "I guess  you can  both make  out here," he said.  Mrs. Cotter was spreading a blanket on the cot as a mattress, with another blanket as cover. Lee lay down on the cot next to the wall. Allerton lay on the outside, and Cotter adjusted a mosquito net.</p>

<p>"Mosquitos?" Lee asked.</p>

<p>"No, vampire bats," Cotter said shortly. "Good night."</p>

<p>"Good night."</p>

<p>Lee's  muscles  ached  from  the  long  walk.  He  was  very  tired.  He  put  one  arm  across  Allerton's chest, and snuggled close to the boy's body. A feeling of deep tenderness flowed out from Lee's body  at  the  warm  contact.  He  snuggled  closer  and  stroked  Allerton's  shoulder  gently.  Allerton moved irritably, pushing Lee's arm away.</p>

<p>"Slack  off,  will you, and  go  to sleep,"  said  Allerton.  He  turned  on his  side,  with  his  back  to Lee.</p>

<p>Lee drew his arm back. His whole body contracted with the shock. Slowly he put his hand under his cheek. He felt a deep hurt, as though he were bleeding inside. Tears ran down his face.</p>

<p>He  was standing  in front  of the Ship  Ahoy. The  place  looked deserted.  He could  hear someone crying. He saw his little son, and knelt down and took the child in his arms. The sound of crying came closer, a wave of sadness, and now he was crying, his body shaking with sobs.</p>

<p>He held little Willy close against his chest. A group of people were standing there in convict suits.</p>

<p>Lee wondered what they were doing there and why he was crying.</p>

<p>When Lee woke up, he still felt the deep sadness of his dream. He stretched out a hand towards Allerton, then pulled it back. He turned around to face the wall.</p>

<p>Next  morning, Lee felt  dry  and irritable  and  empty of  feeling.  He  borrowed Cotter's  .22 rifle  and set out with Allerton to have a look at the jungle. The jungle seemed empty of life.</p>

<p>"Cotter says the Indians have cleaned most of the game out of the area," said Allerton. "They all have shotguns from the money they made working for Shell."</p>

<p>They walked along a trail. Huge trees, some over a hundred feet high, matted with vines, cut off the sunlight.</p>

<p>"May God grant we kill some living creature," Lee said. "Gene, I hear something squawking over there. I'm going to try and shoot it."</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>"How should I know? It's alive, isn't it?"</p>

<p>Lee  pushed  through  the  undergrowth  beside  the  trail.  He  tripped  on  a  vine  and  fell  into  a  saw-toothed plant. When he tried to get up, a hundred sharp points caught his clothes and stuck into his flesh.</p>

<p>"Gene!"  he  called.  "Help  me!  I  been  seized  by  a  man-eating  plant.  Gene,  cut  me  free  with  the machete!"</p>

<p>They did not see a living animal in the jungle.</p>

<p>Cotter  was  supposedly  trying  to  find  a  way  to  extract  curare  from  the  arrow  poison  the  Indians used.  He  told  Lee  there  were  yellow  crows  to  be  found  in  the  region,  and  yellow  catfish  with extremely poisonous spines. His wife had gotten spined, and Cotter had to administer morphine for the intense pain. He was a medical doctor.</p>

<p>Lee was struck by the story of the Monkey Woman: a brother and sister had come down to this part  of  Ecuador,  to  live  the  simple  healthful  life  on  roots  and  berries  and  nuts  and  palm  hearts.</p>

<p>Two years later a search-party had found them, hobbling along on improvised crutches, toothless and  suffering  from  half-healed  fractures.  It  seems  there  was  no  calcium  in  the  area.  Chickens couldn't  lay  eggs,  there  was  nothing  to  form  the  shell.  Cows  gave  milk,  but  it  was  watery  and translucent, with no calcium in it.</p>

<p>The  brother  went  back  to  civilization  and  steaks,  but  the  Monkey  Woman  was  still  there.  She earned  her  monicker  by  watching  what  monkeys  ate:  anything  a  monkey  eats,  she  can  eat, anybody can eat. It's a handy thing to know, if you get lost in the jungle. Also handy to bring along some calcium tablets. Even Cotter's wife had lost her teeth "inna thervith." His were long gone.</p>

<p>He had a five-foot viper guarding his house from prowlers after his precious curare notes. He also had two tiny monkeys, cute but ill-tempered and equipped with sharp little teeth, and a two-toed sloth. Sloths live on fruit in trees, swinging along upside down and making a sound like a crying baby.  On  the  ground  they  are  helpless.  This  one  just  lay  there  and  thrashed  about  and  hissed.</p>

<p>Cotter warned them not to touch it, even on the back of the neck, since it could reach around with its  strong,  sharp  claws  and  drive  them  through  one's  hand,  then  pull  it  to  its  mouth  and  start biting.</p>

<p>Cotter  was  evasive  when  Lee  asked  about  Ayahuasca.  He  said  he  was  not  sure  Yage  and Ayahuasca were the same plant. Ayahuasca was connected with Brujena—witchcraft. He himself was a white Brujo. He had access to Brujo secrets. Lee had no such access.</p>

<p>"It would take you years to gain their confidence."</p><empty-line /><p>Lee said he did not have years to spend on the deal. "Can't you get me some?" he asked.</p>

<p>Cotter looked at him sourly. "I have been out here three years," he said.</p>

<p>Lee tried to come on like a scientist. "I want to investigate the properties of this drug," he said. "I am willing to take some as an experiment."</p>

<p>Cotter said, "Well, I could take you down to Canela and talk to the Brujo. He will give you some if I say so."</p>

<p>"That would be very kind," said Lee.</p>

<p>Cotter did not say any more about going to Canela. He did say a lot about how short they were on supplies,  and  how  he  had  no  time  to  spare  from  his  experiments  with  a  curare  substitute.  After three  days  Lee  saw  he  was  wasting  time,  and  told  Cotter  they  were  leaving.  Cotter  made  no attempt to conceal his relief.</p>

<p><strong>Epilogue:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Mexico City Return</strong></p>

<p>Every time I hit Panama, the place is exactly one month, two months, six months more nowhere, like  the  course  of  a  degenerative  illness.  A  shift  from  arithmetical  to  geometrical  progression seems  to have  occurred.  Something ugly and  ignoble  and subhuman is cooking in this  mongrel town of pimps and whores and recessive genes, this degraded leech on the Canal.</p>

<p>A  smog  of  bum  kicks  hangs  over  Panama  in  the  wet  heat.  Everyone  here  is  telepathic  on  the paranoid level. I walked around with my camera and saw a wood and corrugated iron shack on a limestone cliff in Old Panama, like a penthouse. I wanted a picture of this excrescence, with the albatrosses and vultures wheeling over it against the hot gray sky. My hands holding the camera were slippery with sweat, and my shirt stuck to my body like a wet condom.</p>

<p>An old hag in the shack saw me taking the picture. They always know when you are taking their picture, especially in Panama. She went into an angry consultation with some other ratty-looking people I could not see clearly. Then she  walked to the edge of a perilous balcony and made an ambiguous  gesture  of  hostility. Many so-called  primitives  are  afraid  of  cameras.  There  is  in fact something obscene and sinister about photography, a desire to imprison, to incorporate, a sexual intensity  of  pursuit.  I  walked  on  and  shot  some  boys—young,  alive,  unconscious—  playing baseball. They never glanced in my direction.</p>

<p>Down by the waterfront I saw a dark young Indian on a fishing boat. He knew I wanted to take his picture,  and  every  time  I  swung  the  camera  into  position  he  would  look  up  with  young  male sulkiness. I finally caught him leaning against the bow of the boat with languid animal grace, idly scratching one  shoulder.  A long  white scar  across  right shoulder  and collarbone. I put away my camera and leaned over the hot concrete wall, looking at him. In my mind I was running a finger along  the  scar,  down  across  his  naked  copper  chest  and  stomach,  every  cell  aching  with deprivation. I pushed away from the wall muttering</p>

<p>"Oh Jesus" and walked away, looking around for something to photograph.</p>

<p>A Negro with a felt hat was leaning on the porch rail of a wooden house built on a dirty limestone foundation. I was across the street under a movie marquee. Every time I prepared my camera he would lift his hat and look at me, muttering insane imprecations. I finally snapped him from behind a  pillar.  On  a  balcony  over  this  character  a  shirtless  young  man  was  washing.  I  could  see  the Negro and Near Eastern blood in him, the rounded face and café-au-lait mulatto skin, the smooth body of undifferentiated flesh with not a muscle showing. He looked up from his washing like an animal  scenting  danger.  I  caught  him  when the  five  o'clock  whistle blew.  An  old  photographer's trick: wait for a distraction.</p>

<p>I went into Chico's Bar for a rum Coke. I never liked this place, nor any other bar in Panama, but it used to be endurable and had some good numbers on the juke box. Now there was nothing but this  awful  Oklahoma  honky-tonk  music,  like  the  bellowings  of  an  anxious  cow:  "You're  Drivin'</p>

<p>Nails in my Coffin"— "It Wasn't God Made Honky Tonk Angels"—"Your Cheatin' Heart."</p>

<p>The  servicemen in the joint all had that light-concussion  Canal Zone  look: cow-like and blunted, as  if  they  had  undergone  special  G.I.  processing  and  were  immunized  against  contact  on  the intuition  level,  telepathic  sender  and  receiver  excised.  You  ask  them  a  question,  they  answer without  friendliness  or  hostility.  No  warmth,  no  contact.  Conversation  is  impossible.  They  just have nothing  to say. They sit around  buying  drinks  for  the B-girls, making lifeless passes  which the girls brush off like flies, and playing that whining music on the juke box. One young man with a pimply adenoidal face kept trying to touch a girl's breast. She would brush his hand away, then it  would  creep  back  as  if  endowed  with  autonomous  insect  life.  A  B-girl  sat  next  to  me,  and  I bought her one drink. She ordered good Scotch,  yet. "Panama, how I hate  your cheatin' guts," I thought.  She  had  a  shallow  bird  brain  and  perfect  Stateside  English,  like  a  recording.  Stupid people can learn a language quick and easy because there is nothing going on in there to keep it out.</p>

<p>She wanted another  drink.  I said "No."  She said, "Why  are  you so mean?" I said, "Look,  if I run out of money, who is going to buy my drinks? Will you?"</p>

<p>She looked surprised, and said slowly, "Yes. You are right. Excuse me."</p>

<p>I walked down the main drag. A pimp seized my arm. "I gotta fourteen-year-old girl, Jack. Puerto Rican. How's about it?"</p>

<p>"She's  middle-aged  already,"  I  told  him.  "I  want  a  six-year-old  virgin  and  none  of  that  sealed-while-you-wait shit.  Don't  try  palming  your old  fourteen-year-old  bats  off  on me." I  left  him  there with his mouth open.</p>

<p>I  went  into  a  store  to  price  some  Panama  hats.  The  young  man  behind  the  counter  started singing: "Making friends, losing money."</p>

<p>"This spic bastard is strictly on the chisel," I decided.</p>

<p>He showed me some two-dollar hats. "Fifteen dollar," he said.</p>

<p>"Your prices are way out of line," I told him, and turned and walked out. He followed me onto the street: "Just a minute, Mister." I walked on.</p>

<p>That night I had a recurrent dream: I was back in Mexico City, talking to Art Gonzalez, a former roommate of Allerton's. I asked him where Allerton was, and he said, "In Agua Diente." This was somewhere  south  of  Mexico  City,  and  I  was  inquiring  about  a  bus  connection.  I  have  dreamed many times I was back in Mexico City, talking to Art or Allerton's best friend, Johnny White, and asking where he was.</p>

<p>I flew up to Mexico City. I was a little nervous going through the airport; some cop or Immigration inspector might spot me. I decided to stick close to the attractive young tourist I  had met on the plane. I had packed my hat, and when I got off the plane I took off my glasses. I slung my camera over my shoulder.</p>

<p>"Let's  take  a  cab  into  town.  Split  the  fare.  Cheaper  that  way,"  I  said  to  my  tourist.  We  walked through the airport like father and son. "Yes," I was saying, "that old boy in Guatemala wanted to charge  me  two  dollars  from  the  Palace  Hotel  out  to  the  airport.  I  told  him  uno."  I  held  up  one finger. No one looked at us. Two tourists.</p>

<p>We got into a taxi. The driver said twelve pesos for both to the center of town.</p>

<p>"Wait  a  minute,"  the  tourist  said  in  English.  "No  meter.  Where  your  meter?  You  got  to  have  a meter."</p>

<p>The driver asked me to explain that he was authorized to carry airline passengers to town without a meter.</p>

<p>"No!" the tourist shouted. "I not tourist. I live in Mexico City. ¿Sabe Hotel Colmena? I live in Hotel Colmena.  Take me  to town  but  I  pay  what  is  on  meter.  I  call  police.  Policía.  You're  required  by law to have a meter."</p>

<p>"Oh  God,"  I  thought.  "That's  all  I  need,  this  jerk  should  call  the  law."  I  could  see  cops accumulating around the cab, not knowing what to do and calling other cops. The tourist got out of the cab with his suitcase. He was taking down the number.</p>

<p>"I call policía plenty quick," he said.</p>

<p>I said, "Well, I think I'll take this cab anyway. Won't get into town much cheaper. . . . Vámonos," I said to the driver.</p>

<p>I checked into an eight-peso hotel near Sears, and walked over to Lola's, my stomach cold with excitement. The  bar was in a different  place, redecorated, with new furniture.  But there  was the same old bartender behind the bar, with his gold tooth and his moustache.</p>

<p>"¿Cómo  está?"  he  said.  We  shook  hands.  He  asked  where  I  had  been,  and  I  told  him  South America.  I  sat  down  with  a  Delaware  Punch.  The  place  was  empty,  but  someone  I  knew  was bound to come in sooner or later.</p>

<p>The  Major  walked  in.  A  retired  Army  man,  gray-haired,  vigorous,  stocky.  I  ran  through  the  list crisply with the Major:</p>

<p>"Johnny White, Russ Morton, Pete Crowly, Ike Scranton?"</p>

<p>"Los Angeles, Alaska, Idaho, don't know, still around. He's always around."</p>

<p>"And oh, uh, whatever happened to Allerton?"</p>

<p>"Allerton? Don't believe I know him."</p>

<p>"See you."</p>

<p>"'Night, Lee. Take it easy."</p>

<p>I  walked  over  to Sears  and  looked  through  the  magazines. In one  called  Balls:  For  Real Men,  I was  looking  at  a  photo  of  a  Negro  hanging  from  a  tree:  "I  Saw  Them  Swing  Sonny  Goons."  A hand  fell  on  my  shoulder.  I  turned,  and  there  was  Gale,  another  retired  Army  man.  He  had  the subdued air of the reformed drunk. I ran through the list.</p>

<p>"Most everybody is gone," Gale said. "I never see those guys anyway, never hang around Lola's anymore."</p>

<p>I asked about Allerton.</p>

<p>"Allerton?"</p>

<p>"Tall skinny kid. Friend of Johnny White and Art Gonzalez."</p>

<p>"He's gone too."</p>

<p>"How long ago?" No need to play it cool and casual with Gale. He wouldn't notice anything.</p>

<p>"I saw him about a month ago on the other side of the street."</p>

<p>"See you."</p>

<p>"See you."</p>

<p>I  put  the  magazine  away  slowly  and  walked  outside  and  leaned  against  a  post.  Then  I  walked back to Lola's. Burns was sitting at a table, drinking a beer with his maimed hand.</p>

<p>"Hardly anybody around. Johnny White and Tex and Crosswheel are in Los Angeles."</p>

<p>I was looking at his hand.</p>

<p>"Did you hear about Allerton?" he asked.</p>

<p>I said, "No."</p><empty-line /><p>"He  went  down  to  South  America  or  some  place. With an  Army  colonel.  Allerton  went  along  as guide."</p>

<p>"So? How long has he been gone?"</p>

<p>"About six months."</p>

<p>"Must have been right after I left."</p>

<p>"Yeah. Just about then."</p>

<p>I got Art Gonzalez's address from Burns and went over to see him. He was drinking a beer in a shop across from his hotel, and called me over. Yes, Allerton left about five months ago and went along as guide to a colonel and his wife.</p>

<p>"They were going to sell the car in Guatemala. A '48 Cadillac. I felt there was something not quite right  about  the  deal.  But  Allerton  never  told  me  anything  definite.  You  know  how  he  is."  Art seemed surprised I had not heard from Allerton. "Nobody has heard anything from him since he left. It worries me."</p>

<p>I  wondered  what  he  could  be  doing,  and  where.  Guatemala  is  expensive,  San  Salvador expensive and jerkwater. Costa Rica? I regretted not having stopped off in San Jose on the way up.</p>

<p>Gonzalez and I went through the where-is-so-and-so routine. Mexico City is a terminal of space-time travel, a waiting room where you grab a quick drink while you wait for your train. That is why I can stand to be in Mexico City or New York. You are not stuck there; by the fact of being there at all, you are travelling. But in Panama, crossroads of the world, you are exactly so much aging tissue. You have to make arrangements with Pan Am or the Dutch Line for removal of your body.</p>

<p>Otherwise, it would stay there and rot in the muggy heat, under a galvanized iron roof.</p>

<p>That night I dreamed I finally found Allerton, hiding out in some Central American backwater. He seemed surprised to see me after all this time. In the dream I was a finder of missing persons.</p>

<p>"Mr. Allerton, I represent the Friendly Finance Company. Haven't you forgotten something, Gene?</p>

<p>You're  supposed  to  come  and  see  us  every  third  Tuesday.  We've  been  lonely  for  you  in  the office. We don't like  to say  'Pay up or  else.'  It's  not a  friendly thing  to say. I  wonder  if  you  have ever read the contract all the way through? I have particular reference to Clause 6(x) which can only be deciphered with an electron microscope and a virus filter. I wonder if you know just what</p>

<p>'or else' means, Gene?</p>

<p>"Aw, I know how it is with you young kids. You get chasing after some floozie and forget all about Friendly  Finance,  don't  you?  But  Friendly  Finance  doesn't  forget  you.  Like  the  song  say,  'No hiding place down there.' Not when the old Skip Tracer goes out on a job."</p>

<p>The  Skip  Tracer's  face  went  blank  and  dreamy.  His  mouth  fell  open,  showing  teeth  hard  and yellow as  old  ivory. Slowly  his body slid  down  in the leather  armchair until the back of the chair pushed his hat down over his eyes, which gleamed in the hat's shade, catching points of light like an opal. He began humming "Johnny's So Long at the Fair" over and over. The humming stopped abruptly, in the middle of a phrase.</p>

<p>The  Skip Tracer was talking  in a  voice languid  and  intermittent, like music down a  windy street.</p>

<p>"You meet all kinds on this job, Kid. Every now and then some popcorn citizen walks in the office and tries to pay Friendly Finance with this shit."</p>

<p>He  let  one  arm  swing  out,  palm  up,  over  the  side  of  the  chair.  Slowly  he  opened  a  thin  brown hand, with purple-blue fingertips, to reveal a roll of yellow thousand-dollar bills. The hand turned over, palm down, and fell back against the chair. His eyes closed.</p>

<p>Suddenly his head dropped to one side and his tongue fell out. The bills dropped from his hand, one after the other, and lay there crumpled on the red tile floor. A gust of warm spring wind blew dirty pink curtains into the room. The bills rustled across the room and settled at Allerton's feet.</p>

<p>Imperceptibly the Skip Tracer straightened up, and a slit of light went on behind the eyelids.</p><empty-line /><p>"Keep  that  in  case  you're  caught  short,  Kid,"  he  said.  "You  know  how  it  is  in  these  spic  hotels.</p>

<p>You gotta carry your own paper."</p>

<p>The  Skip  Tracer  leaned  forward,  his  elbows  on  his  knees.  Suddenly  he  was  standing  up,  as  if tilted out of the chair, and in the same upward movement he pushed the hat back from his eyes with one finger. He  walked to the door and turned,  with his right hand on the knob.  He polished the nails of his left hand on the lapel of his worn glen plaid suit. The suit gave out an odor of mold when  he  moved.  There  was  mildew  under  the  lapels  and  in  the  trouser  cuffs.  He  looked  at  his nails.</p>

<p>"Oh, uh . . . about your, uh . . . account. I'll be around soon. That is, within the next few. ..." The Skip Tracer's voice was muffled.</p>

<p>"We'll come to some kind of an agreement." Now the voice was loud and clear. The door opened and  wind  blew  through  the  room.  The  door  closed  and  the  curtains  settled  back,  one  curtain trailing over a sofa as though someone had taken it and tossed it there.</p><empty-line />
