Abstract
Nowadays, the world is becoming increasingly multilingual that the ability to speak a second language has never been as vital as it has been today.
People can use many different ways to develop their proficiency in foreign languages, and reading is undoubtedly one of the best ways to improve their skills.
Reading a book written in original language is not easy task, however, and often leads to the reader giving-up the activity. From this point of view, reading multilingual books has many advantages for foreign-language learners; for example, they can read in the original language and use the translated text as a resource to verify their understanding.
Although multilingual books provide text in two languages, switching between them and finding the translations is not easy. Readers have to move their eyes back and forth from the original language text to the translation, and this will eventually cause breaks in reading activity. Moreover the reader, having the translated text too close to her/his visual field, tends to read it too often. Using two books, the one in original language and the other containing the translation, solves the latter problem, but accentuates the former.

As a solution, ebooks can be used to handle this valuable multilingual
content representation efficiently without the need of moving reader’s eyes.
In this thesis, a multilingual ebook reader application for iOS iPad is pre-
sented. The application exploits ebooks natural “dynamicity” to encounter
difficulties in understanding the foreign language content by uniting the orig-
inal text with the literary translation. Furthermore, it makes use of gestural
interfaces in order to avoid distractions while presenting original-language
content and provides engagement in reading.
